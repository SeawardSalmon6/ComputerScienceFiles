Argument. 


Apollo  at  the  prayer  of  his  priest  Chryses,  whose  daughter  Aga- 
memnon refuses  to  release,  sends  a  pestile?ice  on  the  Greek  army.  At  the 
instance  of  Achilles  a  council  is  called,  in  which  Agame?nnon  agrees  to 
resign  his  captive,  but  declares  his  intention  Jo  seize  Briseis  the  captive 
of  Achilles  as  an  equivalejit.  A  violent  quarrel  ensues  between  the  Kings. 
Achilles  resigns  his  captive  but  withdraws  his  support  from  the  cause  of 
the  Greeks.  Briseis  is  restored  to  her  father,  a?id  sacrifce  being  made, 
Apollo  is  appeased.  Thetis  the  mother  of  Achilles,  moved  by  his  prayers, 
petitio7is  Zeus  to  avenge  on  the  Greeks  the  insult  thus  offered  to  her  son. 
He  consents.  Hera  remonstrating,  receives  a  rebuke  in  presence  of  the 
assembled  Gods.     Hephaestus  consoles  her.

PREFACE. 


THE  question  whether  the  Latin  and  Greek  metres,  and 
particularly  the  hexameter  and  pentameter,  will  ever  be  so 
fully  naturalized  among  us,  as  to  take  their  places  beside  our 
only  other  received  form  ofunrhymed  metre — the  blank  verse — 
has  been  a  good  deal  debated  within  these  few  past  years. 
If  it  were  one  to  be  decided  by  argument,  I  think  that  while, 
on  the  one  hand,  the  objections  urged  against  their  acceptance, 
admit  of  an  easy  and  complete  reply ;  on  the  other,  the 
reasons  adducible  in  their  favour  are  capable  of  being  stated 
with  more  force  and  fulness  than  has  yet  been  done.  A  few 
words  prefatory  to  one  more  attempt  to  show  that  readable 
English  hexameters  can  be  written,  and  are  not  ill  adapted  to 
the  expression  of  the  highest  order  of  poetry,  will  therefore, 
perhaps,  not  be  ill  bestowed  on  an  endeavour  to  place  this 
controversy  on  its  right  grounds. 

It  is  contended,  in  the  first  place,  by  the  opponents  of  this 
addition  to  the  rhythmical  resources  of  our  language,  that  verses 
of  this  kind  have  been  written  in  abundance ;  that  they  are, 
for  the  most  part,  utterly  uncouth  and  barbarous ;  that,  when 
read  as  ordinary  English  verse  would  be  read,  they  convey 
hardly  any  impression  of  being  intended  for  verse ;  and  that, 
to  give  them  the  rhythm  and  cadence  of  the  classical  metres 
they  profess  to  represent,  it  is  necessary,  in  reading  them,  to 
violate  every  usage  of  English  pronunciation  and  accent. 
That  verses  open  to  such  objections  have  been  written  in 
abundance,  is  a  melancholy  truth,  and  one  which  has  gone 
far  to  prejudice  the  public  ear  against  them.     But  it  is  not  in

PREFACE. 


favour  of  bad  verse,  of  this  or  any  other  kind,  that  we  con- 
tend. While  such,  no  doubt,  exists,  it  is  equally  true  that 
many  and  signal  examples  also  exist,  capable  of  satisfying 
the  most  fastidious  classical  reader ;  apart  from  that  one  great, 
and  as  some  consider  it,  insuperable  stumbling-block,  QUANTI- 
TATIVE Prosody. 

The  prosodiacal  objection  to  these  metres  rests  on  the 
alleged  absurdity  of  "composing  verses  in  a  language  regu- 
lated by  accent,  in  a  metre  invented  by  those  who  regulated 
it  by  prosody/'  Now,  if  it  were  true  that  our  reading  of  the 
classic  metres  in  their  own  languages  were  really  guided  by 
prosody  in  that  sense  which  this  di6lum  would  intimate, 
there  would  be  force  in  this  argument.  If,  for  instance,  the 
accent  with  which  the  verses  of  Virgil  and  Horace  are  read  by 
an  educated  Englishman,  uniformly,  or  in  a  great  majority 
of  cases,  fell  on  syllables  long  by  prosody,  and  avoided  short 
ones;  we  could  then  understand  that,  English  metre  having 
little  or  no  prosody,  and  being  guided  entirely  by  accent,  we 
should  be  driven  to  create  a  prosody,  if  we  would  naturalize 
such  metres;  and  should  thus  lapse  into  the  deplorable  blunder 
of  the  Elizabethan  attempts,  which  cannot  be  read  as  verse 
without  exciting  shouts  of  laughter.  But  this,  in  fact,  is  the 
very  reverse  of  the  truth.  Let  any  one  open  his  Virgil,  and 
in  the  first  Eclogue  he  will  find  the  quantity  contradicted  by 
the  accent  four  times  in  the  first  three  lines:  in  the  first 
^Eneid  twice  in  the  first  two;  and  so  on  perpetually:  while,  if 
he  wilfully  accentuate  long  syllables  and  glide  over  short  ones, 
he  will  scarcely  be  able  to  read  Latin*  verse  at  all.     There 


*  With  the  Greek,  and  especially  that  of  Homer,  the  case  is  so  far  different,  that 
there  is  no  such  marked  and  general  discordance  between  accent  and  quantity  in 
our  mode  of  reading  it,  as  in  Latin:  though  instances  enough  of  it  occur  to  bear  out 
our  proposition,  as  to  accent,  and  not  quantity,  being  our  guide  in  reading  the  classic 
metres.     How  many  school-boys  know  the  rules  of  Greek  prosody  ? 


PREFACE.  vii 


cannot  be  a  better  exemplification  of  this  than  the  way  in 
which  we  all  learn  at  school  to  read  Sapphics.  Our  system 
of  accentuation  is  quite  contradictory  to  the  prosodiacal 
quantity;  and  in  proof  that  such  is  our  system  we  need  only 
appeal  to  Canning's  caricature  of  it  in  the  "Knife-grinder." 
The  same  remark  applies  to  our  habitual  accentuation  of  the 
last  penthemimer  of  the  pentameter,  which  the  Latins  usually 
terminate  with  a  dissyllable,  on  the  first  syllable  of  which 
(though  a  short  one)  the  accent,  as  we  read  it,  is  laid.  Neither 
the  English  nor  the  German  pentameter  tolerates  this  usage. 

Again,  the  English  scholar  who  visits  Greece,  and  hears  the 
Iliad  read  by  educated  and  accomplished  modern  Greeks,  is, 
we  are  told,  quite  at  a  loss  to  recognize  either  the  quantity 
of  the  syllables,  or  the  accentuation  which,  to  our  asso- 
ciations, makes  it  verse  rather  than  prose  run  mad.  Are 
we  then  to  say  that,  to  the  modern  Greek,  the  Iliad  is  not 
metre  ?  Or  shall  we  believe  that  the  rebellious  choruses 
of  jEschylus,  which  defy  all  scholarship  to  make  us  accept 
them  as  anything  but  just  such  prose,  conveyed  no  sense 
of  rhythm   to    that    poet's    contemporaries  ? 

I  am  far  from  contending  that  quantitative  prosody  in 
the  classical  languages  adds  no  richness  or  beauty  to  verse. 
The  perception  of  quantity  where  it  exists  does  assuredly  un- 
derlie and  mingle  with  that  of  accent  and  cadence  ;  much  as  in 
music  the  harmony  underlies  and  adds  to  the  enjoyment  of 
the  melody,  even  to  those  ears  which  cannot  clearly  distinguish 
and  follow  the  lower  notes  in  presence  of  the  higher.  And  if 
this  be  (as  I  believe  it  to  be)  something  more  than  a  mere 
fanciful  analogy,  those  cases  in  which  the  accent  occasionally 
contradicts  the  prosody  would  come  to  be  assimilated  to 
passages  in  music  in  which  discords  are  followed  by  their 
resolutions,  or  in  which  the  melody  and  its  accompaniment 
proceed  by  "  contrary  motion,"  to  the  great  enhancement,  if 
well  managed,  of  the  joint  effect.

viii  PREFACE. 


To  reject,  then,  a  metre  which  we  acknowledge  to  be  in 
itself  pleasing  and  harmonious  in  its  cadence,  and  which  has 
many  other  excellent  qualities,  merely  because  we  cannot  sub- 
je6t  it,  in  its  construction,  to  a  set  of  rules  which  our  language 
does  not  acknowledge,  and  by  which  no  other  of  our  metres  is 
bound,  is  wilfully  to  deprive  ourselves  of  a  source  of  pleasure, 
power,  and  variety:  and  is  much  as  if  a  flute-player  were  to 
abstain  from  playing  the  best  airs  of  Haydn  or  Mozart,  because 
they  were  originally  written  for  the  pianoforte,  or  with  a  full 
orchestral  accompaniment. 

If  we  deny  ourselves  the  use  of  the  hexameter  for  the  trans- 
lation of  Homer,  we  have  nothing  to  fall  back  upon  but  the 
decasyllable  Iambic  of  Milton  and  Pope,  varied  only  by  the 
Alexandrine,  as  in  the  Spenserian  stanza;  or  on  the  same 
metre  augmented  by  a  supernumerary  syllable,  constituting 
the  hendecasyllabic  measure  of  Dr  Alford ;  a  great  objection 
to  which  is  its  extreme  tendency  to  fall  into  the  Sapphic 
cadence1.  Against  both  these  metres  (in  their  purity)  the  true 
objection  however  is,  that  they  are  Iambic,  (i.e.  epigrammatic), 
in  their  sharp,  ringing,  accentuated  close ;  and  as  such,  better 
fitted  for  satirical  writing  (for  which  they  were  invented  by 
Archilochus,  as  Horace  informs  us2),  or  for  the  terse,  thoughtful, 
pointed  utterances  of  a  matured  literature ;  while  the  hex- 
ameter, whose  essential  character  is  impulsive,  starting  with  a 
strong  emphasis  (" rising,"  as  Coleridge  has  beautifully  ex- 
pressed it,  "like  the  fountain's  silvery  column"),  exhibits  the 
full  impress  and  youthful  vigour  of  a  nascent  one. 


1  Take,  for  instance,  the  following,  which  every  reader  will  at  once  admit  to  be 
very  excellent  specimens  of  the  English  accentuated  Sapphic : 

"Next,  a  huge  stone  he  placed  against  the  door-way, 
Fearful  in  size.     Not  two-and-twenty  waggons 
Four-wheel'd  and  staunch,   could  stir  it  from  the  ground-sill." 
3  Archilochum  proprio  rabies  armavit  Iambo. 


PREFACE.  ix 

On  the  ground  that  the  Homeric  poems  are  in  reality 
gigantic  ballads,  the  metre  of  the  Lady  of  the  Lake  and 
Marmion  has  been  recommended  for  their  Translation. 
Let  us  try  a  few  lines.

Achilles'  wrath,  to  Greece  the  spring 
Of  myriad  woes,  O  Goddess !    sing : 
Which  hurled  to  Hades'  gloomy  reign

And  gave  their  bodies  on  the  shore 
For  dogs  and  vultures  to  devour, 

Fulfilling  Jove's  behest :

No!  No  !  This  will  never  do.     The  hurdy-gurdy  is  too  slender 
and  feeble  to  echo  the  grand  diapason  roll  of  Homeric  song. 

Another  eminently  advantageous  feature  of  the  hexameter 
verse  is  the  variety  it  admits  in  its  structure;  rendering  it,  of 
all  the  metres  in  which  a  long  poem  can  be  written  or  trans- 
lated, the  least  monotonous.  By  those  indeed  who  lay  it  down 
as  a  first  principle,  that  the  English  hexameter  must  gallop  {i.  e. 
must  be  entirely  dactylic  with  the  exception  of  the  terminal 
spondee)   this    advantage   is    deliberately  sacrificed,  and    ex- 


x  PREFACE. 

changed  for  a  monotony  the  heaviest  and  most  wearisome  of 
which  human  composition  is  capable — the  monotony  of  forced, 
unceasing,  laborious  activity.  In  this  respe&lt;5t,  a  translator  of 
Homer  cannot  do  better  than  follow  the  example  of  the  great 
Original,  whose  lines  exhibit  the  utmost  variety  of  structure* 
Taking  advantage  of  this  liberty,  and  with  the  occasional  in- 
troduction of  lines  in  which  the  caesura  is  deferred,  or  altogether 
dispensed  with,  the  hexameter  will  be  found  to  afford  an 
amount  of  variety  such  as  none  of  the  English  metres  in  use 
possesses. 

As  regards  the  other  conditions,  apart  from  the  choice  of  a 
metre  to  be  observed  in  translating  the  Iliad,  I  cannot  help 
thinking  that  the  present  tendency  of  opinion  is  to  lay  upon 
the  shoulders  of  a  translator  a  burden  too  heavy  to  be  borne. 
It  may,  indeed,  be  possible  to  render,  in  something  like  verse, 
line  for  line,  word  for  word,  construction  for  construction  ;  to 
give  all  the  Gods  and  Heroes  their  Greek  names,  and  to  affix 
in  every  instance  where  it  occurs  the  exact  Homeric  con- 
ventional epithet,  duly  rendered  according  to  its  literal  mean- 
ing. This — it  is  conceivable — might  be  accomplished  :  and, 
when  done,  the  result  would  probably  read  almost  as  much 
like  a  metrical  production  as  the  Propria  quce  maribus,  or  As 
in  prcesenti,  and  would  have  about  the  same  chance  of  finding 
a  single  reader  out  of  school ;  where,  no  doubt,  it  would  be 
exceedingly  popular.  Between  such  a  rendering  and  the 
magnificent  adumbration  of  Pope  (for  whatever  may  be  said 
against  it,  and  with  all  its  faults,  which  are  not  a  few,  I  for  one 
regard  Pope's  Iliad,  taken  per  se,  as  one  of  the  most  mag- 
nificent, if  not  the  most  magnificent  poem  extant)  a  line  must 
be  drawn  somewhere  or  other;  and  it  is  readily  admitted 
must  lie  much  nearer  the  former  than  the  latter  of  the  two

extremes.  A  translation  line  for  line  (with  some  small  rea- 
sonable margin  for  mutual  encroachment  and  recess) — which 
shall  render  the  full  sense  of  the  original  in  every  material 
particular,  and  introduce  as  little  in  the  nature  of  amplifi- 
cation as  the  difference  between  our  monosyllabic  English 
and  Homer's  polyphloisboian  Greek  occasionally  necessi- 
tates (under  the  paramount  obligation  of  producing  unforced, 
fluent,  and  readable  verse,  in  grammatical  English) — this 
does  not  appear  a  task  too  hard  for  mortal  man.  If  however 
to  these  conditions  be  superadded  that  of  retaining  through- 
out the  conventional  Homeric  epithets,  rendered  by  any- 
thing like  their  equivalents,  I  believe  it  to  be  impracticable  in 
our  language  without  a  grievous  sacrifice  of  those  essential 
qualities  which  render  the  perusal  of  a  poem  a  pleasure,  not  a 
task ;  and  its  production  something  more  inviting  than  a 
perpetual  tour  de  force  or  a  school  exercise. 

In  the  German  language  the  case  is  otherwise ;  and  it 
has  been  accomplished  with  what  every  German  reader  will 
allow  to  be  very  remarkable  success  by  Voss :  whose  version 
is  considered  by  his  countrymen  nowise  ungraceful.  But  the 
German  language  is  that  of  all  others  which  affords  the 
greatest  facilities  for  such  a  rendering — a  language  in  which 
substantives,  verbs,  or  adjectives  cohere  by  mere  juxtaposition, 
and  weld  themselves  into  compound  words  even  more  readily 
than  in  the  Greek.*  Owing  to  this,  and  many  other  apti- 
tudes which  our  tongue  does  not  possess,  it  has  been  found 
practicable  to  produce  in  German,  what  may  be  regarded  as 
fac  similes  of  the  Iliad  and  Odyssee,  in  which  every  individual 
line,  with  every  nicety  of  the  meaning,  and  for  the  most  part

hardly  any  transposition  in  the  order  of  the  words,  is  rendered 
with  a  precision  little  short  of  miraculous*  and  which  must  for 
ever  leave  far  behind  it  every  other  possible  attempt  of  the 
kind.  It  is  the  fidelity  with  which  an  excellent  photograph  re- 
produces on  paper  a  magnificent  piece  of  architecture,  in  all 
its  proportions  and  with  every  the  most  minute  detail,  while 
yet  possessing  (with  perhaps  some  degree  of  unpleasing  hard- 
ness) the  air  of  a  picture.  For,  after  all,  such  is  the  im- 
pression which  Voss's  version  produces.  The  simplicity  of 
Homer's  diction,  when  studiously  reproduced  in  language  fa- 
miliar to  our  ears,  is  apt  to  pass  (with  reverence  be  it  spoken) 
into  homeliness,  and  even  baldness  of  expression  (of  which 
any  one  may  convince  himself  by  reference  to  a  literal 
prose  translation  of  even  the  finest  passages),  but  which  is  not 
felt  as  such  when  reading  the  original. 

The  version  of  the  Iliad  here  presented  to  the  reader  was 
commenced  in  October  1861,  on  the  occasion  of  reading  an 
article  in  the  Times  of  the  28th  of  that  month  on  Translations, 
while  in  ignorance  that  any  entire  book  of  Homer  had  ever 
before  been  placed  before  the  English  public  in  its  original 
metre.  Though  a  careful  interpretation  of  the  Greek,  it  does 
not  profess  to  be  a  minutely  close,  much  less  a  strictly  literal 
translation :  while  on  the  other  hand  it  eschews  altogether  any 
attempt  to  clothe  the  simple  and  rude  majesty  of  the  great 
original  in  such  amplitude  of  decorated  wording  as  to  conceal 
its  outlines. 

In  the  detail, of  the  execution  of  his  task,  the  translator  has 
retained  the  Homeric  epithets  as  stick  only  when  really  expres- 
sive of  some  fitting  accessory  to  the  subject-matter,  or  when 
their  introduction  could  be  effected  flowingly,  without  con- 
straint or  awkwardness.  In  many  cases,  without  direct  verbal 
translation,  their  sense  may  be  naturally  interwoven  among 

*  Compare,  for  instance,  Voss's  rendering  of  xvi.   vv.   (250 — 257)   with  the 
original. 


PREFACE. 


the  context.  There  is  no  denying  that  the  continual  recur- 
rence of  these  epithets,  in  season  and  out  of  season,  in  Homer, 
has  a  very  oppressive  effe£t  on  the  modern  ear.  To  be  told 
occasionally,  or  incidentally,  that  Achilles  was  swift  of  foot ; 
that  the  Greeks  wore  brazen  armour  and  good  boots  ;  that 
their  ships  were  hollow  and  black,  and  their  spears  long- 
shadowed  ;  that  they  had  rolling  eyes,  and  Juno  large  ones 
and  white  arms  ;  may  not  be  amiss  as  characteristic  touches 
thrown  in  to  individualize  our  conceptions  of  those  personages. 
But  to  be  systematically  reminded  of  these  particulars  almost 
whenever  the  persons  or  things  so  characterized  are  mentioned, 
is  assuredly  more  in  the  nature  of  a  blemish  than  a  beauty ; 
and  one  which  no  translator  desirous  of  doing  justice  to  his 
original  ought,  in  the  present  state  of  literature,  to  aim  at 
reproducing. 

Neither  has  he  considered  it  necessary  to  be  scrupulous  on 
every  occasion  in  presenting  the  Greek  names  of  the  divinities. 
It  is  generally  done,  but  in  so  long  a  poem  cases  will  occur 
when  the  flow  of  the  metre  is  greatly  facilitated  by  the  sub- 
stitution of  the  more  familiar  Latin  equivalent,  and  in  such 
he  has  preferred  avoiding  an  awkwardness  of  versification  to  a 
rigorous  adherence  to  a  rule  purely  arbitrary  and  self-imposed. 
Something  more  requires  to  be  said  in  respect  of  the  accentu- 
ation of  the  proper  names.  These  have  in  innumerable  cases 
acquired  by  English  usage  an  accent  unconformable  with  their 
prosodiacal  quantity  in  the  Greek.  Thus  it  would  be  absurd 
to  insist  on  accentuating  such  names  as  Id5meneus,  Tlepdlemus, 
Orsilochus,  Astyoche,  Thamyris,  Ocalea,  Clonius,  Helice,  &amp;c, 
otherwise  than  as  here  marked,  though  in  each  the  accented 
syllable  is  short  by  quantity  in  the  Greek  ;  and  so  in  innumera- 
ble other  cases.  In  rendering  the  catalogue  of  the  ships  and 
troops,  accentuation  according  to  the  prosodiacal  quantities 
would  be  simply  ludicrous. 

The  monosyllabic  character  of  our  language  (according  to 


xiv  PREFACE. 


what  has  already  been  observed)  affords  in  most  cases  abundant 
elbow  room,  in  so  ample  a  metre  as  the  hexameter,  for  the  full 
expression  in  each  line  of  the  sense  of  its  Greek  original. 
Occasionally,  indeed,  the  hexametric  mantle  will  be  found  to 
sit  too  loosely,  and  to  require  a  little  expansion  on  the  part  of 
the  wearer  to  fill  it  out  properly.  Homer  too  is  intensely 
tautological,  saying  the  same  thing  over  and  over  again  in  the 
same  sentence ;  in  which  cases  it  is  often  impossible  so  to  vary 
the  phrase  as  not  to  introduce  some  new  idea*.  To  do  this 
gracefully  and  in  keeping  with  the  context  is  the  most  difficult 
part  of  a  translator's  task.  But  whether  gracefully  or  not, 
good  faith  both  to  the  original  and  the  reader  requires  that 
expletory  words  or  phrases  should  be  distinguished  by  some 
typographical  difference.  This  is  accordingly  done  by  the  use 
of  italics  in  our  translation,  and  (so  far  as  is  practicable)  the 
words  so  italicized  are  such  that,  if  omitted,  what  remains  shall 
still  be  readable  as  connected  English.  This,  of  course,  can- 
not always  be  done. 

One  word  more  as  to  the  versification.  The  Hexameter 
metre  is  on  its  trial  in  this  country.  It  is  therefore  entitled 
at  all  events  to  a  fair  hearing.  It  may  at  least  claim  to  be 
read  as  any  other  of  our  received  metres  is  read ;  with  no 
deliberate  intention  to  caricature  it,  or  to  spoil  it  in  the  read- 
ing :  without  sing-song  or  affectation,  and  according  to  the 
ordinary  usages  of  English  pronunciation.  So  tried,  if  it  fail  to 
please  and  to  make  its  way,  it  stands  condemned.  But  in  the 
perusal  of  so  long  a  poem  it  must  be  borne  in  mind,  in  com- 
mon candour,  that  all  our  ordinary  forms  of  verse  have  a  cer- 


*  We  do  not  here  allude  to  the  repetition  in  different  parts  of  the  poem  of  whole 
speeches  or  connected  series  of  lines,  but  to  such  cases  as  those  in  II.  w.  528,  57.9, 
where  speaking  of  Aias  Oileus  the  poet  says,  "He  was  less,  and  not  so  great  as 
Telamonian  Aias,  nor  so  mighty,  but  much  less.  Moreover  he  was  little" — or  in 
the  description  of  the  snow-storm  in  xn.  278,  281,  "when  the  snow-flakes  fall, 
and  Zeus  prepares  to  snow,  and  he  lulls  the  winds,  and  it  snows." 


PREFACE. 


tain  elasticity, — admit  a  certain  latitude  of  accommodation 
between  the  accent  proper  to  the  verse — its  dead  form — and 
that  which  constitutes  its  living  spirit  and  interprets  its  melody 
to  the  hearer.  Nothing  is  more  common,  for  instance,  than  to 
find  our  ordinary  Heroic  or  blank  verse,  which,  theoretically, 
ought  to  consist  wholly  of  iambic  feet,  commencing  with  a 
practical  trochee,  or  including  one  in  some  part  of  its  structure, 
as  in  Milton  for  example, 

In  the  beginning  how  the  Heav'ns  and  Earth 
Rose  out  of  Chaos : 
or, 

while  it  pursues 
77iings  f#zattempted  yet  in  prose  or  rhyme  : 
or  again, 

to  transgress  his  will 
For  one  restraint,  lords  of  the  world  beside. 

No  one  regards  these  occasional  deviations  as  blemishes,  or 
declares  such  verses  unreadable,  if  their  occurrence  be  not  so 
frequent  as  to  draw  attention  and  disturb  our  sense  of  rhythm. 
Nor,  in  a  similar  spirit,  will  the  occasional  commencement  of  a 
Hexameter  with  a  non-emphatic  syllable,  or  the  occurrence  in 
the  course  of  the  line  of  a  weak  syllable  where  a  strong  one 
would  naturally  fall,  or  vice  versa,  be  held  an  unpardonable 
sin  against  rhythm  by  any  one  who  remembers  how  frequently 
the  corresponding  offence  is  committed  by  our  most  classic 
poets  in  commencing  the  line  with  a  feeble,  but  slightly 
emphasized  particle.*  Dabitur  Ucentia  sumfita  pudenter. 
Neither  will  any  one,  reading  this  our  attempt  in  a  similar 

*  As  in  such  instances  as  these,  which  occur  in  the  first  page  of  the  Paradise 
Lost: 

That  to  the  height  of  this  great  argument, 
or, 

Nor  the  deep  tract  of  Hell,  &amp;c. 
In   the  Comus,   the  most  faultless  existing  specimen  of  English  versification, 
examples  of  this  and  the  former  species  of  Irregularity  occur  in  one  out  of  every 
eight  of  the  nine  hundred  lines  of  which  the  dialogue  consists,

liberal  spirit,  be  disposed  to  cavil  at  the  non-elision  of  the  e  in 
the  terminal  syllable  of  past  tenses  and  particles  ;  or  persist  in 
reading  such  words  as  resolved,  destroyed,  &amp;c,  as  tris-syllables, 
contrary  to  the  common  usage  of  English  pronunciation  in 
reading  our  ordinary  prose*.  Objections  indeed  on  such 
grounds  appear  singularly  ill-timed  in  these  days  when  we 
consider  the  excessive  metrical  laxity  of  our  present  most  ap- 
plauded versification,  which  will  produce  deplorable  confusion  : 
since  no  two  readers  will  soon  be  able  to  agree  how  the  verses 
of  some  of  our  highly  popular  poets  are  to  be  read  as  verse. 

It  was  the  translator's  wish  and  intention  to  have  associated 
his  work,  through  the  medium  of  a  dedication,  with  the  name 
of  one,  endeared  by  the  remembrance  of  long  and  uninter- 
rupted friendship — the  late  lamented  Master  of  Trinity  Col- 
lege, Cambridge.  The  melancholy  event  which  cut  short  so 
noble  a  career,  and  robbed  the  Science  and  Literature  of  his 
country  of  so  bright  an  ornament,  has  deprived  him  of  that 
gratification.  It  is  only  the  more  incumbent  therefore  to  ac- 
knowledge here  the  benefits  derived  from  his  sound  and  valu- 
able criticism  during  the  whole  progress  of  the  work  down  to 
its  final  completion  :  resulting  in  the  correction  of  innumerable 
blemishes  in  the  versification,  and  no  small  number  of  misren- 
derings  of  particular  and  delicate  turns  of  expression  in  the 
Greek,  which  his  perfect  knowledge  of  that  language  enabled 
him  to  point  out.  That  it  was  ever  completed  at  all  indeed 
has  been  mainly  owing  to  his  encouragement  and  advice,  such 
not  having  been  the  intention  with  which  it  was  commenced. 
To  his  esteemed  friend  Sir  Henry  Holland  too,  to  whom  some 
portion  of  the  work  has  been  submitted,  the  translator  has  to 
acknowledge  obligations  of  a  similar  kind. 


*  In  the  comparatively  few  instances  in  which  the  termination  of  such  words  is 
intended  to  be  read  as  a  distinct  syllable,  it  is  marked  with  an  accent  thus  \  as  in 

in.  v.  271,  sharp-edged. 


ILIAD.     BOOK  I. 


OING,  celestial  Muse!  the  destroying  wrath  of  Achilles, 

^   Peleus'  son:  which  myriad  mischiefs  heaped  on  the  Grecians, 

Many  a  valiant  hero's  soul  dismissing  to  Hades; 

Flinging  their  corses  abroad  for  a  prey  to  dogs  and  to  vultures, 

And  to  each  bird  of  the  air.    Thus  Jove's  high  will  was  accomplished. 

Ev'n  from  that  fateful  hour  when  opposed  in  angry  contention 

Stood  forth  Atreides,  King  of  men,  and  godlike  Achilles. 

Say,  then!  which  of  the  Gods  involved  these  two  in  their  conflict? 
Jove's  and  Leto's  Son!     For  he,  with  the  leader  offended 
Sent  on  his  army  a  plague,  and  his  people  were  perishing  round  him : 
For  that  Atreides  his  sacred  Priest  had  rudely  dishonoured;       (n) 
Chryses,  who  suppliant  came  to  the  swift-sailing  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Eager  to  rescue  his  daughter,  and  proffring  unlimited  ransom. 
Wreaths  in  his  hands  he  bore  of  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo 
Circling  a  sceptre  of  gold.     Then  thus  besought  he  the  Grecians 
All;   but  th'  Atreidae  first,  the  two  great  arrayers  of  nations:  *.  '• 

"O  ye  Atreidse!  and  you,  ye  bright-armed  Greeks,  to  your  valour 
May  the  great  Gods,  who  dwell  in  the  lofty  Olympian  mansions 
Grant  the  destruction  of  Troy,  and  a  safe  return  to  your  country ! 
Only  restore  me  my  darling  child,  and  accept  what  I  offer,      (20) 
Ever  revering  the  Son  of  Zeus,  far-darting  Apollo." 

Then  loud  shouted  the  Greeks  in  assent:  "Let  her  go!  Let  Apollo 
Glorified  be  in  his  priest !     Take,  take  the  magnificent  ransom ! " 
But  Agamemnon,  Atreus'  son,  disdained  his  petition. 
Roughly  he  drove  him  forth,  and  sternly  rebuked  him  at  parting. 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 


"Hence!    Let  me  catch   thee   no  more,   old    man,    in   our  camp 
either  ling'ring 
Here  round  our  hollow-keeled  ships,  or  returning  again  on  thine  errant/. 
Scarce  should  Apollo  then,  or  his  wreath,  or  sceptre,  avail  thee. 
No  I   Set  her  free  be  thou  sure  I  will  not !  till  age  overtake  her 
There  in  our  palace  at  home,  in  Argos;  far  from  her  country,        (30) 
Weaving  the  web,  and  performing  th'  accustomed  rites  of  my  chamber. 
Hence!  I  say. — Anger  me  not! — Thy  retreat  may  so  be  the  safer." 

Thus  spake  the  King:  and  the  old  man  feared  and  shrank  from 
the  mandate. 
Silent  he  crept  by  the  loud-roaring  sea,  till  far  from  the  vessels 
Then  to  Apollo  supreme,  the  offspring  of  fair-haired  Latona, 
Thus  in  his  anguish  he  prayed,  with  earnest  ana7  long  supplication: — 

"Hear  me!    Thou  of  the  silver  bow! — Thou  guardian  of  Chrysa! 
Thou  who  encompassest  Cilia  the  sacred !     Thou  whose  dominion 
Tenedos  trembling  owns  ! — O  Smintheus !     Hear  me. — If  ever 
Decking  thy  temple  with  festive  crowns  I  have  burned  on  thine  altar 
Thigh  *of  the  bull  or  fat  of  the  goat — oh !  grant  my  petition :  (41) 

Let  thine  arrows  requite  to  the  Greeks  these  tears  I  am  shedding." 

Thus,  loud  sobbing,  he  prayed;  and  his  prayer  reached  Phoebus  Apollo. 
Down  from  the  lofty  crest  of  Olympus  he  plunged  on  the  instant, 
Ire  in  his  heart.     On  his  shoulders  his  bow  was  slung,  and  his  quiver 
Gorgeously  wrought,  and  the  shafts  clashed  loud  as  he  moved  in  his  anger. 
Down  he  swept,  like  the  presence  of  night,  and  approaching  alighted 
Somewhat  apart  from  the  ships,  and  among  them  sent  forth  an  arrow. 
Dire  was  the  twang  of  the  silver  bow  \     Then  spread  the  contagion 
First  among  mules,  and  the  lazy  dogs  that  prowled  round  the  vessels.  (50) 
Next  came  a  piercing  shaft  which,  winged  with  bitterer  vengeance 
Flew  through  the  ranks ;  and  the  funeral  pyres  blazed  fast  and  unceasing. 
Nine  days  thus  did  the  God  deal  forth  his  darts  on  the  army : 
But  on  the  tenth,  convened  by  Achilles,  the  people  assembled. 
Such  was  the  course,  to  his  mind  which  the  white-armed  Hera  suggested, 
Grieved  as  she  was  to  behold  her  Greeks  thus  helplessly  dying. 

When  the  assembly  was  formed,  and  all  were  collected  in  council, 
Rising  before  them,  thus  spoke  forth  swift-footed  Achilles: 
"Surely  methinks,  O  Atreides!    the  time  is  come  for  retreating 


Book  1.1  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Baffled,  back  to  our  homes;  too  happy  with  life  but  escaping,    (60) 
Should  the  sword  haply  spare  what  the  plague  may  leave  of  the  Grecians. 
Let  us  however  consult  some  Priest  or  Prophet,  or  Dreamer : 
(For  in  the  visions  of  night  Zeus  oft  discloseth  his  counsels) 
Such  may  reveal  why  Phoebus  Apollo's  wrath  is  excited: 
Whether  by  broken  vows,  or  by  hecatombs  due  but  jieglecled: 
So  that  perchance  by  the  savour  of  lambs  and  kidlings  unblemished 
Soothed  a?id  appeased,  he  may  stay  this  plague  and  cease  from  his  auger" 

Thus  having  said  he  resumed  his  seat.   Then  arose  from  among  them 
Calchas,  Thestor's  son,  far-famed  as  the  wisest  of  augurs, 
One  to  whose  mind  inspired,  the  past,  the  present,  the  future         (70) 
All  were  alike  revealed:   that  Seer,  whose  sage  divination 
(Phoebus  Apollo's  gift)  had  guided  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Safely  to  Ilion's  shore.     And  thus,  complying,  he  answered: 

"  Dost  thou  command  me  Achilles,  beloved  of  Zeus,  to  inform  thee 
Wherefore  Apollo  the  bright  far-darting  King  is  offended? 
Then  must  I  speak.    But  swear  to  me  first,  and  pledge  hie  thine  honour 
Promptly  with  word  and  deed  to  support  me,  whatever  may  happen. 
Well  do  I  deem,  my  report  will  enrage  that  Prince  whose  dominion 
Glorious  o'er  Argos  extends,  whose  sway  the  Achaians  acknowledge. 
Dire  is  the  wrath  of  a  King  when  unequally  matched  with  a  subject  (80) 
What  though  he  seem  to  digest  the  affront?  Yet  the  pride  of 'the  Monarch 
Inwardly  broods  o'er  revenge,  and  long,  long  after,  will  wreak  it. 
WTeigh  then  the  risk.  Wilt  thou  hold  me  unharmed,  such  danger  incurring  f 

Then  making  answer  in  turn,  thus  spake  swift-footed  Achilles  : 

"Boldly  declare  what  thou  knowest.  Whate'er  thine  oracle,  say  it! 
For  by  Apollo,  beloved  of  Zeus,    by  the  God  at  whose  altars 
Bending  in  prayer,  thou  Calchas !  receivst  Heav'n's  dread  revelations, 
None,  while  I  live  and  view  with  these  eyes  the  conduct  of  mortals, 
No  !   not  one  of  the  Greeks,  shall  lay  but  a  finger  upon  thee  (89) 
Here  in  our  hollow-keeled-ships :  ev'n  shouldst  thou  name  Agamemnon, 
Noblest  and  mightiest  of  all  in  "our  host  though  he  vaunt  his  position." 

Thus  reassured,  the  blameless  seer  took  courage  and  answered  : 
"  'Tis  for  no  broken  vow,  no  hecatomb  due  but  neglecled; 
But  for  his  outraged  Priest,  by  Atreides  rudely  insulted 
Heeding  nor  ransom  nor  prayer,  his  daughter  detaining  in  bondage  : 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 


For  this  cause  the  far-darting  God  hath  sent  and  will  send  us 
Woes  upon  woes:  and  heavy  his  hand  shall  weigh  on  the  Grecians 
Till,  without  ransom  or  price,  the  bright-eyed  maid  be  conducted 
Back  to  her  father  in  Chrysa.     Perchance,  then,  a  hecatomb  offered 
To  the  offended  Pow'r  may  disarm  his  wrath  and  preserve  us."      (ioo) 

Thus  having  said  he  sate.    Then  in  haste  uprose  Agamemnon 
Atreus'  heroic  son,  wide  ruling  o'er  many  a  nation. 
Furious  he  rose.     In  his  gloomy  soul  o'ermastering  passion 
Struggled  for  vent,  and  a  torchlike  fire  blazed  forth  from  his  eyeballs. 
Bending  on  Calchas  a  withering  scowl,  at  once  he  addressed  him. 

"  Prophet  of  evil !  to  me  thy  bodings  have  ever  been  hateful. 
Still  doth  thy  cankered  heart  delight  in  th'  announcement  of  mischief. 
Ne'er  from  thy  lips  good  words, — from  thy  hands  good  works  have 

proceeded: 
And  now,  true  to  thy  mission  of  ill,  the  Greeks  thou  haranguest, 
Stirring  them  up  to  believe  that  Apollo  for  me  hath  chastised  them,  (no) 
Mine,  forsooth  I  is  the  crime,  who  the  virgin  daughter  of  Chryses 
Lawfully  kept,  and  her  ransom  refused:    much  longing  to  carry 
Back  to  my  native  home,  so  fair,  so  graceful  a  maiden, 
Whom  Clytsemnestra  herself,  when  I  led  her  a  bride  to  the  altar, 
Hardly  in  person,  in  temper,  in  mind,  or  accomplishments  equalled. 
But,  if  it  must  be  so,  then  Id  her  depart,  I  resign  her. 
Ne'er  be  it  said  that  for  pleasure  of  mine  the  people  should  perish. 
Only  forthwith  prepare  me  a  prize :   that  alone  of  the  Argives 
Unrewarded  I  go  not:    for  that  indeed  were  unseemly. 
All  of  you  bear  me  witness!    My  just  reward  I  relinquish."    (120) 

Godlike  Achilles,  swift  in  the  race,  then  rose  up  in  answer. 
"Ill,  O  Atreides!  beseems  such  rank  with  such  avarice  blended! 
How  can  our  generous  Greeks  be  taxed,  a  new  prize  to  assign  thee? 
Public  store  have  we  none  where  treasure  is  laid  up  in  common. 
Soon  as  a  town  is  sacked,  the  spoil  on  the  spot  is  divided, 
Nor  were  it  just  to  reclaim  from  the  troops  what  once  is  allotted ; 
Yield  her  then,  frankly,  at  once  to  the  God,  and  the  Greeks  will 

compensate 
Threefold  and  four  thy  loss,  when  the  word  of  Zeus  is  accomplished, 
And  the  embattled  towers  of  Troy  lie  smoking  in  ruin." 


Book  I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Fierce  in  his  royal  pride  this  answer  returned  Agamemnon.       (130) 
"Not  so,  brave  as  thou  art,  and  of  Godlike  presence,  Achilles! 
Xot  so  deceive  thyself,  nor  think  to  beguile  or  persuade  me. 
Think'st  thou  unquestioned  thy  prize  to  retain?  that  tamely  contented 
I  shall  my  own  resign? — resign  her  too.  at  thy  orders  ? 
Xo !  let  the  generous  Greeks  with  fitting  and  duteous  selection 
Grant  an  equivalent  prize,  as  a  fair  and  just  compensation ; 
All  shall  be  well.     If  not,  I  shall  seize  on  the  prize  of  another: 
Thine  perchance,  or  the  spoil  of  Aias  or  mighty  Odysseus. 
Rage  he  may  upon  whom  I  shall  come.     I  reck  not  his  anger. 
This  when  the  time  shall  better  allow.  Now  proceed  we  to  action.  (140) 
First  let  a  sable  vessel  be  launched  on  the  wide-rolliog  ocean 
Manned  with  the  needful  rowers.     A  hecatomb  duly  provided 
Place  in  her  hold,  and  let  fair  Chryseis  herself  be  conducted 
Safely  on  board.    To  some  chief  of  renown  the  command  be  entrusted, 
Aias  or  Creta's  King,  or  the  wisdom  divine  of  Odysseus, 
Aye,  or  thyself,  Peleides!    most  dreadful  of  men:   that  the  anger 
Of  the  far-darting  God  may  be  soothed  by  our  prayers  and  our  offerings." 

Scornfully  frowning  upon  him  at  once  swift-footed  Achilles 
Answered  him  thus.    "O  wrapped  up  in  insolence!  blinded  by  lucre! 
Which  of  the  Greeks  henceforth  will  cheerfully  arm  at  thy  bidding,  (150) 
Toil  in  the  wearisome  march,  or  rush  with  delight  to  the  combat  ? 
Moved  by  no  personal  hate  'gainst  Troy  and  her  warlike  defenders 
Came  I  hither  to  fight;  for  nought  have  they  done  to  offend  me. 
Cattle,  nor  steed,  of  mine  have  they  seized;  nor  in  hostile  invasion 
Swept  over  Phthia's  realm,  nor  wasted  her  bounteous  harvests. 
Far,  far  parted  we  lie,  with  the  roaring  ocean  between  us, 
And  the  o'ershadowing  crests  of  many  a  mountainous  barrier. 
In  thy  quarrel,  O  lost  to  all  shame !  are  we  come ;  for  thy  pleasure 
Insolent !  seeking  redress  from  the  Trojans  for  thee  and  thy  brother, 
Thankless,  and  reckless  of  all  we  have  done,  of  all  we  have  suffered. 
Now,  for  a  crowning  affront,  to  seize  my  prize  thou  hast  threatened  (161) 
Bravely  and  hardly  won,  and  conferred  by  the  Sons  of  Achaia ! 
Equal  to  thine  no  spoil  hath  ever  to  me  been  awarded 
When  to  the  Grecian  arms  some  populous  city  has  yielded. 
Foremost  ever  in  fight,  and  sustaining  the  brunt  of  the  battle 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 


Sword  in  hand  am  I  found ; — but  so  sure  as  the  spoil  is  divided 
Thine  is  the  choice  of  the  prey ;  while,  some  pleasing  trifle  accepting, 
Weary  and  faint  with  toil,  I  bear  it  away  to  my  vessels. 
Now  unto  Phthia  my  course  I  take: — for  better  I  deem  it 
Home  with  my  ships  to  return,  since  thus  dishonoured,  and  leave  thee 
Here  to  thy  fate,  ingloriously  fighting  for  riches  and  plunder."       (171) 

Then  Agamemnon  King  of  men  this  answer  returned  him  : 
"Fly,  by  all  means,  if  such  be  thy  mind.     Not  ev'n  for  a  moment 
Will  I  entreat  thee  with  me  to  remain.     I  lack  not  companions 
True  to  my  cause  and  my  glory,  nor  Zeus  for  my  guide  and  proteclor. 
Hateful  beyond  all  Princes  whom  Heav'n  with  power  hath  entrusted ; 
Nought  but  strife  is  thy  soul's  delight,  and  battle  and  slaughter. 
Say,  thou  art  brave!    'Tis  the  gift  of  God  which  thus  thou  prof anest. 
Fly  then,  I  say!   With  thy  ships  and  thy  troops  betake  thee  to  Phthia; 
There  o'er  thy  Myrmidons  rule.     For  know,  proud  prince!   that  I 
reck  not  .  (J8o) 

Or  of  thine  aid  or  thy  wrath :  and,  speak  'st thou  of  threats  1  thus  I  threaten: 
Since  at  my  hands  Apollo  demands  the  daughter  of  Chryses, 
Forthwith  let  her  depart.     In  my  ship,  with  my  escort,  I  send  her. 
Then  to  thy  tent  I  shall  come,  and  thy  prize,  thy  lovely  Briseis 
Claim,  and  lead  her  away: — so  that  ev'n  thyself  shalt  acknowledge 
Mine  the  superior  power,  and  warned  by  thy  bitter  example, 
All  henceforth  shall  dread  to  dispute  my  right  or  defy  me." 

Thus  he  spake;  and  a  pang  through  Peleides  shot.    In  his  bosom 
Shaggy  and  rough,  his  heart  by  conflicting  thoughts  was  divided : 
Whether  at  once  to  snatch  from  his  thigh  his  keen-edged  falchion  (190) 
Break  through  th'  assembled  chiefs  and  strike  to  the  earth  his  insulter, 
Or  to  control  his  mind  and  arrest  the  career  of  his  passion. 
Thus  while  doubtful  he  stood  in  his  troubled  spirit  debating — 
Half  unsheathed  while  appeared  the  mighty  sword — from  Olympus 
Pallas  Athene  came,  whom  the  white-armed  Hera  commissioned 
Equally  both  in  her  heart  regarding,  and  anxious  to  save  them. 
Standing  behind  him,  his  golden  locks  she  grasped ; — and  Peleides 
Turned;  and  amazed  he  stood  when  her  awful  eyes  he  encountered, 
Only  to  him  revealed  among  all  the  heroes  assembled;  [200] 

Startled,  but yet  not  calmed ',  in  impassioned  words  he  addressed  her.  (200) 


Book  L]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


"And  art  thoucome/h?///  Heaz'n,  great  Daughter  of  Zeus  to  be  witn  e  5 
How  Agamemnon,  Atreus:  son,  both  wrongs  and  degrades  me? 
TJien  shaft  thou  see — and  my  words  may  not  be  long  in  fulfilling — 
— How.  perchance  with  his  life  he  shall  pay  for  his  pride  and  his  insults 

Thus  then  in  turn  replied  the  blue-eyed  Goddess  Athene : 
"  H:j.r  me!  and  calm  thy  passion,  and  bend  thy  soul  to  obey  me! 
For  this  cause  from  Olympus  I  come,  by  Hera  commissioned 
Equally  friendly  to  both,  and  equally  anxious  to  save  you. 
Cease  from  this  strife.    With  thy  hand  draw  not  thy  sword  from  its 
scabbard.  [2I°] 

Words  be  thine  only  weapons :  and  spare  them  not,  but  reproach  him.  z  1 : 
For  be  assured — (and  ere  long  my  words  shall  be  fully  accomplished) 
Threefold  in  splendor  and  worth  shall  gifts  upon  gifts  be  repaid  thee 
For  this  insolent  act.     But  restrain  thy  rage,  and  obey  0 

Then  replying  in  turn,  thus  spake  swift-footed  Achilles. 
•A:  such  bidding,  O  Goddess!  no  choice  but  obedience  is  left  me, 
Grievously  angered  at  heart  though  I  be:  for  such  is  my  duty 
"Whoso  the  Gods  reveres,  his  prayers  will  find  them  propitiov. 
Then  with  a  pond  rous  grasp  on  the  hilt  with  silver  resplendent 
Back  in  its  scabbard  he  plunged  the  mighty*  sword:  to  Athene     [220] 
Hearkening.     She  meanwhile  her  flight  to  Olympus  had  taken,     : : : 
There  in  the  mansions  of  Zeus  rejoining  her  fellow  immortals. 

Once  more  now,  his  heart  still  stcelling  with  anger.  Achilles 
Thus  Agamemnon  addressed,  in  words  injurious  and  bitter. 
u  Drunken  with  pride!  thou  dog  in  thy  look,  but  deer  in  thy  natir 
When  did' st  thou  ever  with  hearty  alacrity  arm  for  the  battle, 
Or  to  the  dreadful  ambush  go  forth  with  the  chiefs  of  the  Grecia  as 
Nought  but  terror  and  death  in  exploits  like  these  thou  behold  st 

ier  ~  terns  it  and  safer  to  plunder  thy  friends;  through  the  army 
Ranging  at  large,  and  seizing  the  share  of  whoe'er  may  oppose  thee !  [230] 
Hah  ! — what  a  king  art  thou,  who  mak'st  a  prey  of  thy  subje  ■:":        23c 
Subjects  too  base  to  resent : — or  this  were  the  last  of  thy  insults. 
Hear  then  my  Jixed  resolve,  and  the  oath  I  take  to  confirm  it. 
By  this  sceptre  which  torn  from  its  parent  trunk  on  the  mountains 
Blossom  or  bud  shall  never  renew— by  the  axe  of  the  woodman 
Stripped  of  its  branches  and  bark, — by  this  sacred  sceptre  I  swear  it; 


io  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 

Emblem  of  justice  and  truth,  upborne  by  the  sons  of  the  Grecians, 
Guardians  of  laws,  protectors  of  rights  handed  dozen  from  their  fathers, 
Sanctioned  byZeushimself!  (such  an  oath  e'en  to  thee  would  be  binding) 
Surely  with  yearning  of  heart  each  Greek  shall  long  for  Achilles  [240] 
When  beneath  Hector's  slaughtering  sword  thine  army  shall  perish,(24o) 
Then  shalt  thou  groan  in  spirit,  unable  to  save  or  to  help  them 
Self  condemned,  and  gnawed  by  remorse  and  rage  at  thy  folly, 
Shamefully  thus  to  have  used  the  best  and  bravest  among  them." 

Thus  he  spake;  and  dashed  on  the  ground  his  sceptre  in  anger 
Studded  with  golden  stars: — then  sate,  defiant  and  scornful. 
Him  with  increasing  wrath  Agamemnon  eyed.     Up  arose  then 
Nestor,  the  Pylian  sage,  whose  eloquence,  clear  and  persuasive 
Flowed  from  his  lips  in  harmonious  accents,  sweeter  than  honey. 
Two  generations  in  sacred  Pylos  beneath  his  dominion  [25°] 

Reared  to  articulate  speech,  and  o'ertaken  by  age  had  he  witnessed, 
Sov'reigfi  at  once  and  friend.  Now  ruled  he  the  third  in  succession,  (251) 
Wisely  and  kindly  counselling  both,  in  these  words  he  addressed  them. 

"Gods!  What  a  weight  of  grief  descends  on  the  land  of  Achaia! 
How  will  Priam  exult,  and  his  sons,  and  the  host  of  the  Trojans! 
How  will  their  souls  rejoice  should  report  convey  to  their  hearing 
This  unseemly  dispute,  where  two  such  chiefs  are  contending, 
First  in  the  councils  of  Greece,  and  her  foremost  leaders  in  battle ! 
Be  persuaded !    Remember  that  I  am  much  older  than  either, 
Aye,  and  in  days  gone  by  with  men  far  braver  and  greater     [260] 
Long  consorted  on  friendly  terms;  and  they  never  disdained  me.  (260) 
Ne'er  have  I  seen — ne'er  more  shall  I  see  such  men  as  were  Dryas, 
Shepherd  and  guide  of  his  flock ;  Peirithous,  Exadius,  and  Cceneus. 
These  were  Heroes  indeed! — Nor  less,  divine  Polyphemus, 
Theseus  too,  great  y£geus'  son,  most  like  the  immortals. 
Bravest  were  these  of  all  whom  Earth  on  her  bosom  hath  nurtured. 
Bravest  they  were,  and  bravely  they  fought  with  the  fiercest  of  beings, 
Evn  with  the  mountain  Centaurs,  and  slew  them  in  terrible  combat. 
These  were  my  friends  and  associates :  by  these  from  Pylos  invited 
Hastening  to  join  them  I  came;  from  afar,  from  the  Apian  country; 
And  by  their  side  I  fought,  as  best  I  might.    But  against  them      [271] 
No  man  of  mortal  mould  could  avail,  such  as  earth  now  produces.  (271) 


Book  I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Yet  they  obeyed  my  word ;  gave  willing  ear  to  my  counsels. 
You,  too,  let  me  persuade:   for  to  yield  to  persuasion  is  wiser. 
Great  as  thou  art,  O  Atreides !  beware  how  thou  seize  on  the  damsel. 
Leave  her.    Respect  th'  award  pronounced  by  the  sons  of  Achaia. 
Thou  too,   Peleus'  son!  forbear  to  contend  with  our  sov'reign; 
Since  to  no  sceptred  Prince  whom  Zeus  hath  delighted  to  honour 
Loftier  place  or  greater  renown  hath  e'er  been  awarded. 
Say,  thou  art  mighty,  as  well  beseems  thy  descent  from  a  Goddess,  [280] 
Yet  is  he  higher  in  rank;  for  wider  extends  his  dominion. —         (280) 
Once  more,  Atreides !  dismiss  thy  wrath.     'Tis  Nestor  entreats  thee. 
Urge  thine  opponent  no  more :  for  to  whom  shall  we  look  but  Achilles 
In  the  rough  chances  of  war,  as  the  strength  and  stay  of  our  nation?" 

Then  making  answer  replied  Agamemnon,  ruler  of  nations: 
"Rightly,  O  reverend  sage!   on  either  part  hast  thou  spoken: 
But  we  have  here  a  man  who  will  dictate  on  every  occasion; 
Nought  but  his  will  must  be  law ;  and  all  must  bend  in  his  presence : 
Yet  there  is  one,  methinks,  who  will  yield  to  no  such  pretensions. 
Grant  that  th'  immortal  Gods  an  accomplished  warrior  have  made  him  [290] 
Have  they  with  this  conferred  an  unbounded  licence  of  insult?"     (290) 

Him  interrupting,  thus  broke  in  the  godlike  Achilles: 
"Base,  indeed,  should  I  be,  and  deserve  the  name  of  a  coward 
Were  I  to  yield  me  a  slave  to  whate'er  thy  caprices  may  dictate. 
Issue  thy  orders  to  others!    Command  not  me!  for  henceforward 
Thee  and  thy  cause  I  disown,  and  spurn  the  control  of  a  tyrant. 
This  too  hear  me  declare,  and  well  shaft  thou  do  to  observe  it : 
Neither  with  thee  nor  that  other  in  Troy  will  I  fight  for  a  woman. 
(Since  thus  meanly,  ye  Greeks,  ye  resume  the  prize  ye  have  given 
Take  it  /)  But  when  thou  com'st  to  my  ship  dark  frowning  upon  thee  [300] 
Nought  that  is  mine  beside  shaft  thou  touch,  with  me  to  resist  thee.  (300) 
Or  shouldst  thou  dare  it,  come  on;  make  trial,  that  all  may  behold  it; 
Quickly  my  spear's  broad  blade  with  thy  streaming  blood  shall  be 
purpled." 

Thus  with  fierce  words  contended  the  chiefs  by  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
Both  then  abruptly  rose,  and  at  once  dissolved  the  assembly. 
Thence  to  his  tents  and  stately  ships  departed  Achilles, 
With  him  his  faithful  friend  Mencetius'  son  and  their  comrades. 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 


But  by  Atreides'  order  was  launched  a  swift-sailing  galley 
Manned  with  twenty  selected  rowers;  a  hecatomb  duly 
Placed  in  the  hold  for  the  God ;  and  the  fair  Chryseis  conducted  [310] 
Ev'n  by  himself  on  board :  and  Odysseus  the  wise  was  commander.  (3 10) 
Swiftly,  when  all  were  embarked,  they  swept  o'er  the  paths  of  the  waters. 

This  performed,  Atreides  a  solemn  lustration  commanded. 
All  the  people  were  cleansed,  and  the  sea  received  their  ablutions. 
Next,  to  Apollo  of  bulls  and  goats  whole  hecatombs  offered 
Blazed,  in  long  order  ranged,  on  the  shore  of  the  desolate  ocean. 
Rich  was  the  steam  that  rose  with  the  eddying  smoke  from  the  altars. 

In  such  rites  was  the  army  engaged.    Meanwhile  Agamemnon 
Bearing  his  threat  to  Achilles  in  mind,  Eurybates  summoned, 
And    Talthybius,    heralds    and    messengers    swift;    and    addressed 
them:  [320] 

"  Haste  ye  both  to  the  tent  of  Peleus'  son,  to  Achilles  :    [322]  =  (320) 
Claim  Briseis  the  fair,  and  lead  her  respectfully  hither. 
This  should  Achilles  refuse,  I  shall  take  her  by  force,  and  in  person 
Backed  by  o'erwhelming  numbers;  and  that  will  be  harder  upon  him." 
Such  was  his  order,  and  strict  the  injunction  he  added  on  parting. 
Sad  and  reluctant  they  passed,  on  the  shore  of  the  desolate  ocean, 
Ev'n  to  the  tents  and  ships  of  the  Myrmidon  host :  and  Achilles 
Gloomily  sitting  they  found  in  front  of  his  tent,  by  the  vessels. 
Greeting  he  gave  them  none,  for  small  was  his  joy  to  behold  them.  [330] 
They,  on  their  part,  confused  in  his  princely  presence,  and  awestruck, 
Silent  remained,  nor  raised  their  eyes,  nor  delivered  their  errand.  (330) 
This  when  the  chief  perceived  in  his  mind,  he  mildly  addressed  them : 
"Hail!  ye  Heralds,  messengers  high  of  Zeus  and  of  mortals. 
Fearless  and  free  draw  nigh.     Not  you  do  I  blame  but  your  master. 
Well  do  I  know,  by  constraint  ye  come  for  the  damsel  Briseis, 
And  ye  shall  take  her.     Divine  Patroclus !  bring  forth  the  maiden. 
Hand  her  to  these  in  charge.     But  now  I  call  you  to  witness, 
Now,  unto  Gods  in  Heaven  and  mortals  on  Earth  to  proclaim  it 
And  to  your  tyrant  king: — should  ever  henceforth  by  his  army    [340] 
Need  of  my  aid  be  felt,  to  save  them  from  shame  and  destruction — 
— No !  Let  them  die! — while  he,  in  the  frenzied  whirl  of  his  passion  (340) 
Powerless  alike  to  learn  from  the  past  or  plan  for  the  future, 


Book  I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  13 

Driv'n  to  their  ships  when  they  fight  for  their  lives,  shall  be  helpless 
to  lead  them." 

Thus  he  spake :  and  Patroclus  obeyed  his  friend  and  companion, 
And  from  the  inmost  tent  led  forth  the  lovely  Briseis  [34-6] 

And  to  their  charge  consigned.  With  viomaxny  fear  and  reluctance  (345) 
Slowly  she  moved  by  their  side,  as  they  passed  to  the  ships  of  Achaia. 

Then  retreated  Achilles  apart  from  the  sight  of  his  comrades. 
Downward  bent,  and  weeping,  he  sate,  as  he  gazed  o'er  the  ocean 
Hoary  with  breakers  ashore,but  darkening  ^z'z7zj-/tfr7/z  in  the  distance,  [3  50] 
Seaward  "his  hands  extending,  at  length  he  prayed  to  his  mother  1(3  50) 
"O  my  Mother!  since  at  my  birth  short  life  was  ordained  me, 
Surely  almighty  Zeus,  high  thundering,  throned  in  Olympus, 
Might  have  enlarged  it  with  glory.    But  none  hath  he  hitherto  granted. 
Lo!  with  what  burning  disgrace  Agamemnon,  ruler  of  nations, 
Brands  me,  wresting  away  the  prize  I  won  by  my  valour." 

Thus  he  spake.    But  his  mother  august  in  the  depths  of  the  ocean 
Heard  his  complaint,  where  she  sate  beside  her  reverend  Father. 
Swift,  like  a  rising  mist,  from  the  hoary  deep  she  ascended; 
Sate  beside  him,  and  marked  his  tears:  then  fondly  caressing       [360] 
Laid  in  his  hand  her  own,  and  endearingly  naming,  bespoke  him.  (360) 
"Why  dost  thou  weep?  my  child :  what  grief  hath  seized  on  thy  spirit? 
Speak !  Conceal  not  thy  sorrows,  but  let  them  be  common  between  us." 

Heavily  sighing,  thus  replied  swift-footed  Achilles  : 
"Well  thou  know'st.    Why  then  should  I  tell  thee  all  as  it  happened? 
Thebe  the  sacred  fell  to  our  arms,  Aetion's  city. 
This  we  sacked  and  plundered,  and  hither  we  came  with  the  booty. 
Fairly  and  justly  was  all  disposed  by  the  Sons  of  Achaia, 
And  to  our  chief  Atreides  the  fair  Chryseis  allotted. 
Chryses  then,  the  Priest  of  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo  [37°] 

Came  to  our  camp  and  the  ships  of  the  Greeks  resplendent  in  armour,  (3  7  o) 
Eager  to  rescue  his  daughter,  and  proff 'ring  unlimited  ransom. 
Wreaths  in  his  hands  he  bore  of  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo 
Circling  a  sceptre  of  gold :  and  he  urged  his  suit  on  the  Grecians 
All ;  but  th'  Atreidae  first,  the  two  great  arrayers  of  nations. 
Then  with  one  voice  loud  shouted  the  Greeks  in  assent;  that  Apollo 
Honoured  should  be  in  his  Priest,  and  the  costly  ransom  accepted. 


i4  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 

But  Agamemnon  Atreus'  son,  disdained  his  petition. 
Roughly  he  drove  him  forth,  and  sternly  rebuked  him  at  parting. 
Baffled  and  angry,  the  good  old  man  withdrew,  but  Apollo      [380] 
Heard  the  complaint  of  his  prayer,  (for  he  loved  him  well)  and  avenged 

him.  (381) 

Upon  the  Argives  he  sent  a  destroying  shaft;  and  the  people 
Perished  in  heaps  on  heaps.     Each  moment  faster  and  thicker 
Flew  through  their  army  the  darts  of  the  God.   Out  spake  then  a  Prophet 
Who  the  Far-darter's  will  well  knew;  and  denounced  the  offender. 
Foremost,  at  once  I  exhorted,  the  God  to  appease :  but  Atreides 
Took  it  in  wrathful  mood,  and  rising  before  the  assembly 
Uttered  that  shameful  threat  which,  now  he  hath  dared  to  accomplish. 
Ev'n  while  the  keen-eyed  Greeks  are  escorting  the  damsel  to  Chrysa, 
Freighting  with  costly  gifts  for  the  God  the  best  of  their  vessels,    [390] 
Heralds  have  come  to  my  tent  and  my  ships,  and  have  seized,  and 

are  leading  (39°) 

Brises'  daughter  away,  my  prize,  and  the  gift  of  Achaia. 
Now,  my  Mother,  aid  if  thou  can'st  thy  son  in  his  trouble. 
Speed  to  Olympus  and  there  prefer  to  Zeus  thy  petition; 
If  thou  hast  ever,  in  word  or  deed  done  aught  to  delight  him. 
Have  I  not  heard  thee  boast  in  my  Father's  palace,  relating 
How  that  the  cloud-enshrouded  Kronion  to  thee  was  indebted, 
Thee  of  th'  immortals  alone,  for  his  rescue  from  bonds  and  dishonour 
Ezhi  in  that  fearful  hour  when  all  endeavoured  to  chain  him, 
Hera,  with  dread  Poseidon  joined,  and  Pallas  Athena?  [400] 

Then  thou  cam'st  O  Goddess,  and  freed  him.    Then  at  thy  summons 
He  of  the  hundred  hands,  Briareus  (so  ye  call  him  in  Heaven,     (401) 
Men  upon  earth  ^geon)  Olympus  scaled,  and  beside  him 
Sate,  exulting  in  might.     Far  mightier  was  he  than  his  father!      [405] 
Him  when  the  Gods  beheld,  they  shuddered,  obeyed,  and  desisted. 
Go  then;  remind  him  of  this,  and  his  knees  embracing,  approach  him; 
Bid  him  be  gracious  and  aid  the  Trojans  to  drive  to  their  vessels,  (406) 
Crowded  like  sheep  to  the  slaughter,  the  recreant  Greeks ;  who  may  glory 
Then,  if  they  please,  in  their  King — their  Atreides  ruler  of  'nations! 
While  Agamemnon  himself  shall  know,  and  acknowledge  his  frenzy, 
Thus  to  have  shamed  and  dishonoured  thebestand  bravest  among  them." 


Book  L]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  15 

Dropping  a  pitying  tear,  thus  Thetis  kindly  responded:        (411) 
"  Why,  ah!  why  did  I  bear  thee,  my  child!  and  rear  thee  to  sorrow? 
Evil,  alas!  was  the  hour  when  I  gave  thee  birth  in  my  palace. 
Oh !  could'st  thou  safe  remain,  withdrawn  from  war,  by  thy  vessels 
Tearless  at  least,  if  not  long-lived ;  since  destiny  wills  it. 
Now  must  thy  span  of  days  be  at  once  both  joyless  and  fleeting ! 
Yet  will  I  bear  thy  words  to  the  Thunderer's  throne,  to  Olympus, 
Soaring  aloft  to  its  snow-crowned  heights ;  and  perchance  he  will  hear 
me.  [42°] 

Thou  meanwhile,  by  the  swift  sailing  ships,  in  haughty  seclusion 
Hold  thee  aloof  from  the  Greeks,  nor  lead  thy  troops  to  the  battle.  (420) 
Zeus  since  yester-morn,  on  the  farthest  verge  of  the  Ocean, 
Honours  the  pure  ^Ethiopians'  innocent  feast.    At  the  banquet 
All  th'  immortals  attend.     Twelve  days  they  feast ;  then  Olympus 
Opens  its  bronze-paved  halls  to  receive  them.     There  will  I  enter, 
Clasp  his  knees  and  beseech  him, — and  surely  I  think  he  will  hear  me." 

Thus  having  spoken,  the  Goddess  departed,  leaving  Achilles 
Wroth  for  the  loss  of  his  captive,  the  fair  one  so  gracefully  cinctured, 
Torn  from  his  tent  by  force. 

Now  happily  speeding,  Odysseus      [430] 
Chrysa's  shore  had  attained,  the  votive  hecatomb  bearing. 
When  to  the  haven  deep  they  had.  come,  and  were  fairly  within  it  (430) 
First  their  sails  they  furled,  then  stowed  them  away  in  the  vessel. 
Lowering  next  the  mast,  they  lodged  it  secure  on  its  bearing, 
Smartly  bringing  it  down  by  the  stays:  then  rowed  to  their  moorings; 
Dropped  astern  huge  sleepers  of  stone  made  fast  by  the  hawser, 
And  through  the  breaking  surf  made  good  their  footing  and  landed ; 
Then  disembarked  the  hecatomb  due  to  Phoebus  Apollo  : 
Fair  Chryseis,  the  last,  from  the  ship  to  the  shore  they  conducted. 
Leading  her  then  to  the  altar,  the  wise  Odysseus  restored  her      [440] 
Safe  to  the  hands  of  her  Father  dear ;  and  thus  he  addressed  him : 

"  Hither,  O  Chryses  !  sent  by  the  King  of  men,  Agamemnon  (440) 
Lead  I  thy  daughter  back,  and  a  hecatomb  bring,  to  Apollo 
Due  from  the  suffering  Greeks,  who,  beneath  the  scourge  of  his  anger 
Bitterly  groan,  and  pray  that  appeased  he  will  cease  to  afflicl  them." 
Then  to  her  Father  gave,  and  he  rejoicing  received  her. 


1 6  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 

Now,  without  farther  delay  were  the  victims  ranged,  round  an  altar 
Solidly  built  and  sculptured,  in  goodly  array,  for  the  orT'ring. 
Then  with  clean-washed  hands  they  upheaved  the  salt  and  the  barley, 
Chryses  praying  aloud  with  arms  extended  to  Heaven.  [45°] 

"Hear  me,  thou  of  the  silver  bow!    Thou  guardian  of  Chrysa! 
Thou  who  encompassest  Cilia  the  sacred!  Thou  whose  dominion  (450) 
Tenedos  owns;  since  bending  thine  ear  to  the  prayer  of  my  anguish 
Honouring  thy  Priest,  thou  hast  poured  affliction  and  woe  on  the 

Grecians ; 
Once  more  extend  thy  grace,  and  grant  this  further  petition : 
Cease  from    thy  wrath   and  avert    from    Greece    the    plague   which 
consumes  her." 

Thus  he  prayed,  and  his  prayer  was  heard  by  Phoebus  Apollo  : 
But  when  the  prayer  was  ended,  the  meal  on  the  victims  they  sprinkled, 
Turned  up  their  heads  to  heaven  and  slew  them ;  flayed  and  divided. 
Severing  the  thighs,  they  wrapped  them   in  cauls  of  fat,  and  about 
them  [460] 

Doubled  the  folds,  and  morsels  attached  from  each  part  of  the  carcase. 
These  with  billets  the  old  man  burned  on  the  altar  and  o'er  them  (460) 
Poured  the  red  sparkling  wine  ;  while  youths  attendant  around  him 
Each  with  his  five-pronged  fork  in  hand,  stood  ready  for  service. 
They,  when  the  thighs  were  burned  and  the  entrails  formally  tasted, 
Cut  to  pieces  the  rest,  transfixed,  and  skilfully  roasted;  [465] 

Drew   them  from   off  their  forks   and  served  them  for  meat  to   the 
Vofries.  (465) 

Now  was  the  rite  concluded,  the  banquet  spread,  and  they  feasted 
Each  to  his  soul's  content;  nor  lacked  there  abundance  or  welcome. 
But  when  the  cravings  of  hunger  and  thirst  were  somewhat  abated, 
Full  to  the  brim  with  wine  th'  attendants  handed  them  goblets,    [47°] 
First  having  spilled  a  libation  from  each ;  and  the  youths  of  Achaia  (470) 
All  through  the  live-long  day  raised  high  their  voices  in  chorus ; 
Hymned  the  far-darting  God,  and  in  sweet  melodious  cadence 
Chanted  their  Paeans  of  praise :  and  his  soul  was  pleased  as  he  listened. 
Then,  when  the  Sun  was  set,  and  darkness  had  fall'n  on  the  ocean, 
All  retired  to  sleep,  on  the  shore,  by  the  stern  of  the  vessel. 

Soon  as  the  mother  of  dawn,  the  rosy-fingered  Aurora 


Book  I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  17 


Tinted  the  eastern  sky,  for  the  Grecian  camp  they  departed. 
Fair  was  the  wind  and  strong,  which  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo 
Sent :  and  they  hoisted  the  mast,  and  the  white  sails  spread,  which 
received  it  [480] 

Full  in  the  midst  of  their  swell: — and  they  bounded  along;  and  the 
waters  (480) 

Roared  round  the  keel  as  it  ploughed  the  dark-blue  wave  in  its  progress. 
Soon  to  the  camp  they  came  and  the  long-drawn  lines  of  the  Grecians. 
Then  on  the  main-land  shore  their  sable  galley  they  stranded       [485] 
High  on  the  beach,  and  supported  on  beams  extended  beneath  her: 
Then  dispersed,  and  returned,  each  man  to  his  tent  or  his  vessel.  (485) 

Peleus'  heav  n-born  Son  meanwhile,  swift-footed  Achilles 
Sate  by  his  ships  aloof;   and  still  o'er  his  injuries  brooding 
Nurtured  his  wrath :  nor  once  did  he  join  the  chiefs  in  their  council  [490] 
Nor  to  the  war  go  forth:  but  pined  in  heart  with  impatience 
Thus  to  remain  inaclive;  and  longed  for  the  din  of  the  battle.      (490) 

Day  after  day  thus  passed.    With  the  dawn  of  the  twelfth  to  Olympus 
All  the  immortal  Gods  in  long  procession  ascended 
Zeus  at  their  head.  Then,  mindful  of  all  to  her  Son  she  had  promised,  [495] 
Thetis  rose  from  the  waves,  and  soaring  aloft  in  the  cether 
Through  the  wide  concave  of  heaven,  attained  the  heights  of  Olympus. 
There,  on  the  loftiest  of  all  its  bristling  peaks  she  beheld  him,     (496) 
Him,  the  far-seeing  son  of  ancient  Kronos,  exalted 
High,  and  apart  enthroned : — and  she  knelt  before  him  and  suppliant 
With    her    left   hand    embraced    his    knees,    while    her    right    she 
extended  [5°°] 

Raising  his  flowing  beard;   and,  seconding  thus  her  petition,       (500) 
Humbly  besought  Kronion,  the  sov'reign  of  Gods  and  of  mortals. 

"Father  Zeus!    If  e'er  in  thy  need  I  have  brought  thee  assistance 
Either  by  word  or  in  deed  here  in  Heav'n,  oh !  grant  my  petition 
Honour  my  son!    If  his  days  indeed  must  be  transient  and  fleeting, 
Gild  them  with  glory  !    Behold  how  the  King  of  Men,  Agamemnon 
Shames  and  degrades  him;  claiming  his  prize  and  wresting  it  from  him. 
Wipe  off  the  stain !  Great  Sire  of  Olympus,  wise  in  thy  counsels  ! 
Grant  unto  Troy  success  and  increase  her  force,  till  the  Grecians 
Haste  to  requite  the  wrongs  of  my  son  and  restore  him  to  honour."  [510] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 


Thus  she  spake :  but   Zeus  nought  answered.     In  cloud  and  in 
silence  (5IQ) 

Long  he  remained  unmoved.    But  Thetis  renewed  her  entreaties 
Clasping  more  closely  his  knees,  and,  beseechingly  urgent,  implored  him, 
"Grant,  oh!  grant  what  I  ask. — Assuredly  grant: — or  refusing 
Tell  me  at  once.  (Thouneed'st  no  reserve.)  That  word  shall  convinceme 
How,  among  all  the  Pow'rs  the  most  dishonoured  is  Thetis." 

Zeus,  compeller  of  clouds  thus  answered,  touched  with  compassion : 
"This  will  be  matter  of  high  dispute.     Unwelcome  to  Here 
Must  my  decision  appear;  and  bitter  will  be  her  reproaches. 
Oft  to  th'  immortal  Gods  unjustly  I  hear  her  complaining       [520] 
That  with  too  partial  mind  I  assist  the  arms  of  the  Trojans.         (52°) 
Therefore  depart,  lest  Hera  behold  thee  lingering  beside  me. 
So  let  it  be.    Thy  prayer  is  heard.    Be  mine  to  fulfil  it. 
Lo!  in  assent  my  head  I  bow.    This  holiest  of  pledges 
Known  to  th'  immortals  all  as  the  sign  and  seal  of  the  future,      [525] 
Faithful,  never  revoked,  unfailing,  take  for  assurance."  (525) 

Forward  his  dark  and  awful  brows  he  bent,  and  inclining 
Bowed  his  immortal  head ;  while  deep,  at  the  nod,  o'er  his  features 
Rolled  his  ambrosial  locks  :  and  Olympus  shook  to  its  center.     [530] 

Thus  resolved  they  parted ;  and  down  to  the  depths  of  the  Ocean 
Thetis  plunged  at  once  from  the  glorious  heights  of  Olympus.      (530) 
Zeus  to  his  palace  returned,  where  the  Gods  all  rose  at  his  entrance 
Rev'rent  before  their  Sire.     Not  one  dared  wait  his  arrival 
Seated:  but  all  stood  ranged  in  awed  array  in  his  presence, 
Till  he  assumed  his  throne.     Then  Here,  keenly  remembering 
How  to  her  Consort,  Thetis  the  silver-footed  the  daughter 
Of  the  old  Ocean  sire  had  come  and  conferred;  Avith  reproaches 
Bitter,  and  sharply  urged,  the  son  of  Kronos  accosted. 

"Artful   one!    which   of    the   Gods    admit' st    thou    now    to    thy 
counsels  ?  [54°] 

Ever  delighting  thy  plans  to  conceal,  and  maturing  in  secret 
All  thy  decisions  apart;   unto  her  most  entitled  to  know  them    (540) 
Ne'er  dost  thou  deign  to  impart  one  word  of  all  thou  designest." 

Thus  then  returned  for  answer  the  Father  of  Gods  and  of  mortals. 
"Hope  not,  Hera!  that  all  my  plans  shall  to  thee  be  confided, 


Book  I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  19 

That  were  too  hard  for  thy  thoughts;  though  my  throne  and  my  couch 

thou  partakest. 
Yet  be  assured  of  this  ;  that  whate'er  may  be  fit  for  thy  knowledge 
No  one,  either  of  Gods  or  of  men,  shall  learn  it  before  thee. 
As  for  the  rest — whate'er  I  conceal  in  the  depths  of  my  counsels 
That  forbear  thou  to  ask — and  resign  erfn  the  wish  to  discover."  [550] 
Raising  her  large  majestic  eyes,  thus  Hera  responded: 
"  Dread  and  severe  Kronion!  whatwords  are  these  thou  hast  uttered?(5  50) 
Rarely  indeed  have  I  asked,  or  wished  to  partake  of  thy  secrets. 
Free  wert  thou  ever  from  question  of  mine  to  plan  as  thou  listed'st 
But  now  I  tremble  for  Greece:  for  have  I  not  seen  on  Olympus 
Thetis,  the  silver-footed,  the  sea-god's  daughter,  approach  thee 
Clasping  thy  knees  at  dawn?  Aye!  and  much  I  fear  she  beguiled  thee; 
And  that  the  awful  pledge  thou  gav'st  was  to  honour  Achilles, 
Heaping  the  shore  with  dead,  by  the  ships  of  the  suffering  Grecians." 

Zeus,  compeller  of  clouds,  thus  answering,  sternly  addressed  her:  [560] 
"Restless  ever  in  spirit,  and  too  perversely  suspicious! 
Nought  will  thy  wiles  effect ;  but  can  only  place  thee  in  future     (560) 
Farther  apart  from  my  heart :  and  this  will  be  harder  upon  thee. 
Say!   were  it  e'en  as  thou  think'st: — what  imports,   if  such  be  my 

pleasure  ? 
Take  then  in  silence  thy  seat,  and  respect  the  word  of  thy  Sovereign: 
For,  be  assured,  not  all  the  power  of  the  Gods  in  Olympus 
Aught  would  avail  in  thy  cause,  should  my  anger  be  kindled  against  thee." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  Goddess  august,  subdued  and  in  silence 
Bent  her  large  orbs  on  the  ground  and  resumed  her  throne :  and  a  sadness 
Fell  on  th'  assembled  Gods  in  that  celestial  mansion.  [57°] 

This  to  dispel  essayed  Hephaestus..    He  the  contriver, 
Famed  for  his  works  of  toil  and  of  art,  uprose  to  harangue  them  (570) 
Cov'ring  with  festive  speech,  well-timed,  his  mother's  confusion. 
"  Here  will  be  mischief  indeed,  if  you  two  quarrel,  disturbing 
All  the  peace  of  Olympus  with  insupportable  wrangling! 
Let  men  settle  their  own  disputes :  for  if  strife  and  contention         [575] 
Reign  in  these  halls,  then,  alas !  farewell  to  the  joy  of  our  banquets.  (575) 
Let  me  advise  thee,  my  mother  (who  ne'er  wert  lacking  in  prudence), 
Make  thy  peace  with  my  Father  Zeus,  lest  again  he  upbraid  thee 


20  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  I. 

This  ti?ne  worse  than  the  last ;  and  our  feast  be  spoiled  by  your  quarrel. 
Think  !  should  the  lightning  flash  of  Olympian  Zeus  be  directed  [580] 
Full  upon  all  your  thrones,  ye  Gods  ! — I  tremble  to  think  o/i't !      (580) 
Soothe  him  then  with  appeasing  words,  dear  Mother !  and  trust  me 
Soon  will  the  gracious  Pow'r  be  pleased  and  restore  us  to  favour." 
Thus  having  spoken  he  rose,  and  filling  a  two-handled  goblet 
Held  it  forth  to  his  Mother  dear,  and  thus  he  addressed  her : 
"  Patiently  bear  what  thou  canst  not  mend!  and  make  no  remonstrance, 
Hard  though  it  seem,  my  Mother :  for  sad  would  it  be  to  behold  thee, 
Dear  as  thou  art,  struck  down;  while  in  vain  I  should  long  to  assist  thee. 
Trust  me.    Full  hard  is  the  task  to  contend  with  Zeus  in  his  anger. 
Once  too  oft  have  I  tried  it  myself  when,  pressing  to  aid  thee,        [590] 
Seized  by  the  foot  I  was  hurled  from  the  lofty  portals  of  Heaven  :  (590) 
All  day  long  did  I  spin  through  the  air,  and  the  sun  was  descending 
When  upon  Lemnos  I  fell:  and  the  Sintians  found  and  restored  me 
Breathless  and  bruised  as  I  lay :  for  small  was  the  life  that  was  left  me. 

Thus  he  spake,  and  Hera  was  cheered,  and  her  arm  she  extended 
White  as  the  snow,  and  with  smiles  the  cup  from  her  Son  she  accepted : 
He  forthwith  to  the  rest  of  the  Gods,  and  to  each  in  his  order 
Filled;  drawing  fresh  from  its  urn  the  delicious  juice  of  the  Nectar; 
While  from  them  all  unextinguished  laughter  arose,  as  Hephaestus 
Bustling   with   awkward  gait   they   beheld,    through    the    halls    of 
Olympus.  [600] 

Thus  they  feasted  in  bliss  all  day  till  the  sun  was  declining :      (600) 
Nor  was  there  wanting  aught  to  enhance  the  joy  of  their  banquet 
Either  of  festive  cheer,  or  the  tuneful  harp,  by  Apollo 
Struck ;  while  the  Muses  sang,  sweet  answ'ring,  or  blending  in  chorus. 
But  when  the  sun  had  withdrawn  his  glorious  light  and  departed,  [605] 
Then,  for  needful  repose  each  God  retired  to  his  palace,         (605) 
For  with  ingenious  craft  that  limping  artist  Hephaestus 
Famed  for  his  skill,  had  constructed  for  each  his  separate  dwelling. 
Zeus  ascended  the  couch  which,  whene'er  he  conse?ited  to  slumber 
— Laying  aside  for  an  instant  his  flaming  bolts — he  frequented. 
There  he  reclined,  in  celestial  calm  reposing;  and  Here  [610] 

Quitting  her  throne  of  gold  lay  tranquilly  sleeping  beside  him.      (6  l  1)

Argument. 

In  consequence  of  a  vision  sent  by  Zeus  inspiring  him  with  false  hopes 
of  the  immediate  capture  of  Troy,  Agamemnon  assembles  the  leaders  of  the 
Greeks,  relates  the  vision  to  them,  and  in  pursuance  of  a  concerted  scheme 
for  trying  the  temper  of  the  army,  harangues  the  troops,  proposing  an 
immediate  abandonment  of  their  enterprise.  They  prepare  with  eagerness 
to  ad  cm  the  suggestion,  but  Odysseus  inspired  by  Pallas  recals  them  to  their 
duty.  The  assembly  is  resumed.  Thersites  ?nakes  an  insolent  speech  and 
is  rebuked  and  chastised  by  Odysseus.  At  his  exhortations  and  those  of 
Nestor,  the  Greeks  prepare  for  battle  and  muster  on  the  plain  before  Troy. 
A  catalogue  is  given  of  the  ships  and  confederate  foixes,  specifying  the 
contingent  of  each  of  the  Grecian  states  and  their  leaders.  They  march 
towards  the  city.  Iris  in  the  likeness  of  Polite s  annomices  their  approach 
to  the  assembled  Trojans,  who  prepare  for  aclion.  A  catalogue  of  the 
Trojan  and  auxiliary  forces  and  their  leaders. 


ILIAD.     BOOK  II. 


ALL  the  rest  of  the  Gods,  and  the  crested  chiefs  of  the  armies 
Slept  through  the  night.  But  Zeus  to  the  sweets  of  slumber  inclined 
not. 
Deeply  he  mused  in  his  thoughts  how  best  he  might  honour  Achilles 
Heaping  the  shore  with  many  a  corse  by  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
This  to  his  mind  appeared  the  most  effectual  counsel ; 
Down  to  Atreides  a  baleful  dream  to  send  and  delude  him. 
Thus  then  the  Vision  addressing  he  sped  forth  the  words  of  his  errand. 
"  Hie  thee  away,  thou  baleful  Dream  !  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
When  thou  shalt  reach  the  tent  of  Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon, 
There  this  message  declare,  in  the  self-same  words  that  I  tell  thee.   (10) 
Bid  him,  in  all  their  force,  the  long-hair'd  troops  of  Achaia 
Summon  to  arms,  and  array:  for  now,  perchance  he  shall  capture 
Troy,  with  her  spacious  streets;  since  divided  no  more  in  opinion 
All  th'  immortals  who  dwell  in  the  bright  Olympian  mansions 
Yield  before  Here's  prayers;  and  woes  impend  o'er  the  Trojans." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  Dream,  his  command  receiving,  departed. 
Quickly  it  glided  down  to  the  swift-sailing  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Where  reposed  Agamemnon,  Atreus'  son,  and  it  found  him 
Stretched  in  the  couch  in  his  tent,,  and  steeped  in  ambrosial  slumber. 
There  it  stood,  and  leaned  o'er  his  head,  like  Nestor  in  semblance    (20) 
Neleus'  son,  of  the  Greeks  whom  most  Agamemnon  respected: 
Like  in  feature  and  voice.     Then  spake  the  mysterious  Vision  : 
"Sleep'st  thou,  Atreides,  son  of  the  warlike  tamer  of  horses? 
Ill  befits  it  a  chief  in  whose  care  are  the  welfare  of  nations 
And  the  high  conduct  of  war,  to  devote  whole  nights  to  his  slumbers. 


24  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Rouse  thee  at  once,  and  attend !    From  Zeus  I  bring  thee  a  message 
Who,  from  above  looking  down,  with  a  fond  regard  for  thy  glory, 
Bids  thee,  in  all  their  force,  the  long-hair'd  troops  of  Achaia 
Summon  to  arms,  and  array :  for  now  perchance  thou  shalt  capture 
Troy,  with  her  spacious  streets  ;  since  divided  no  more  in  opinion  (30) 
All  th'  immortals  who  dwell  in  the  bright  Olympian  mansions 
Yield  before  Here's  prayers:  and  woes  impend  o'er  the  Trojans 
Sent  from  the  hands  of  Zeus.     But  do  thou  remember  my  message. 
Let  it  not  fade  from  thy  thoughts  when  sleep  shall  have  fled  from  thine 

eyelids." 
Thus  having  spoken,  the  Vision  departed  leaving  Atreides 
Picturing  that  in  his  mind  which  should  ne'er  receive  its  fulfilment: 
Weak  and  misled!  He  believed  that  the  day  was  come  for  the  capture 
Of  the  proud  city  of  Priam;  nor  knew  what  Zeus  was  devising  : 
Knew  not  the  griefs  and  woes  he  would  heap  on  Greeks  and  on  Trojans 
Groaning  beneath  their  load,  in  the  dreadful  struggle  impending.       (40) 
Starting  from  sleep,  the  celestial  voice  still  ringing  around  him, 
Up  he  sate  on  his  couch,  and  a  tunic  drew  o'er  his  person 
Soft  and  fresh  and  fair;  then  his  ample  mantle  about  him 
Cast,  and  his  sandals  rich  to  his  smooth  white  feet  he  adjusted; 
Slung  in  its  belt  from  his  shoulders  his  sword  all  studded  with  silver; 
Grasped  his  paternal  sceptre,   enduring,  sacred  and  stainless; 
And  to  the  ships  went  forth  of  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia. 

Eos,  goddess  of  morn,  had  advanced  on  the  breadth  of  Olympus 
Light  announcing  to  Zeus  and  to  all  the  other  immortals, 
When,  at  the  king's  command  the  shrill-voiced  heralds  his  army    (50) 
Roused,  and  summoned  the  long-hair'd  Greeks  to  assemble  in  council. 
Wide  was  the  order  proclaimed,  and  quickly  the  people  obeyed  it. 
First,  however,  a  council  he  held  of  chiefs  and  of  elders 
Duly  convened  at  the  ship  of  Nestor  the  Pylian  sov'reign. 
There,  in  the  presence  of  all,  this  artful  scheme  he  propounded  : 

"  Listen  !  my  Friends.      A  Vision,  in  night's  ambrosial  silence 
Came  to  me  while  I  slept,  from  Heaven  descending;  like  Nestor 
Noble,  in  form,  in  stature,  and  mien  it  appeared,  and  its  station 
Took  near  my  head,  and  over  me  leaning,  thus  it  addressed  me  : 
'Sleep'st  thou,  Atreides,  son  of  the  warlike  tamer  of  horses?  (60) 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  25 

111  befits  it  a  chief  in  whose  care  are  the  welfare  of  nations 
And  the  high  conduct  of  war,  to  devote  whole  nights  to  his  slumbers. 
Rouse  thee  at  once,  and  attend !    From  Zeus  I  bring  thee  a  message, 
Who  from  above  looking  down,  with  a  fond  regard  for  thy  glory 
Bids  thee,  in  all  their  force,  the  long-hair'd  troops  of  Achaia 
Summon  to  arms,  and  array;  for  now,  perchance  thou  shalt  capture 
Troy,  with  her  spacious  streets :  since  divided  no  more  in  opinion 
All  th'  immortals  who  dwell  in  the  high  Olympian  mansions 
Yield  before  Here's  prayers;  and  woes  impend  o'er  the  Trojans, 
Sent  by  the  hand  of  Zeus.    But  do  thou  refnember  my  message!'     (70) 
Thus  having  spoken,  it  flitted  away.     Then  slumber  forsook  me. 
Now  be  our  care  the  sons  of  Greece  to  prepare  for  the  combat. 
First  will  I  try  them  with  words  of  contrary  sense,  as  is  prudent; 
Bidding  them  man  each  bench  of  their  ships,  and  fly  for  their  safety. 
You  then  among  them  dispersed,  dispel  their  fears  and  retain  them." 

Thus  having  said  he  resumed  his  seat.     Up  rose  then  among  them 
Nestor,  whom  Pylos'  sand-strown  realms  obeyed  as  their  sov'reign, 
Who  with  considerate  words,  falling  in  with  the  project,  addressed  them. 
"Friends,  and  Leaders  of  Greece!    Ye  chiefs  of  experience  in  council 
Were  it  by  other  lips  that  a  dream  like  this  had  been  told  us  (80) 

All  would  pronounce  it  false;  and  all  would  shun  the  relator. 
But  'tis  the  first  of  our  host,  the  noblest  and  best,  who  has  seen  it. 
Come  then!  as  best  we  may,  let  us  arm  the  sons  of  Achaia." 

Thus  he  spake,  and,  leading  the  way,  went  forth  from  the  council, 
Followed  by  all  the  sceptred  chiefs,  their  commander  obeying; 
While  in  tumultuous  throngs  the  troops  came  rushing  to  meet  them. 
As  when  the  nation  of  bees  from  the  cleft  rock's  hollow  recesses 
Issues  in  clustering  groups,  out-pouring  in  endless  succession, 
Swarm  upon  swarm;  in  the  vale  o'er  the  vernal  blossoms  they  murmur 
Hovering  hither  and  thither  in  dense  and  busy  commotion :  (90) 

So  from  their  ships  and  tents  came  forth  the  gathering  nations 
Troop  after  troop;  and  covered  the  shelving  beach  with  their  numbers, 
Pressing  towards  the  place.    Jove's  messenger,  Rumour,  among  them 
Ran  like  a  conflagration  and  drove  them  on.     In  the  meeting 
All  was  eager  alarm  :  while  earth  resounding  beneath  them 
Groaned  as  they  took  their  seats :  and  a  clamour  arose.  But  the  heralds, 


26  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Nine  in  number,  their  voices  strained,  and  exhorted  to  silence 
Claiming  a  hearing  for  those  whom  Zeus  with  dominion  had  gifted. 
Silence  at  length  was  obtained,  all  soon  were  ■  seated  in  order. 
Then  Agamemnon  rose  to  address  them,  bearing  the  sceptre       (100) 
Wrought  by  Hephaestus'  self  who  with  care  and  skill  had  adorned  it. 
This  he  presented  to  Zeus  the  sov'reign  of  Gods  and  of  mortals. 
Zeus  to  his  messenger  gave  it,  to  Hermes,  slayer  of  Argus ; 
Who  as  a  king,  consigned  it  to  Pelops,  tamer  of  horses  : 
Pelops  to  Atreus  gave  it,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people: 
Atreus  dead,  to  Thyestes  it  came,  the  wealthy  in  cattle  : 
Last,  on  great  Agamemnon's  self  it  devolved;  to  be  wielded 
Emblem  of  sway  o'er  Argos  wide  and  many  an  island. 
Leaning  on  this,  he  sent  forth  his  voice  der  the  mighty  assembly. 

"Friends,  and  Heroes  of  Greece,  ye  valiant  servants  of  Ares!  (no) 
Zeus  hath  entangled  me  sore  in  the  toils  of  his  heavy  displeasure ; 
Cruel!     For  did  he  not  promise,  and  nod  from  his  throne  to  confirm  it, 
Ilions  tow'rs  to  uproot,  and  restore  me  in  triumph  to  Argos? 
'Twas  but  a  planned  and  bitter  deceit !     For  now  he  commands  me 
Home  to  return  inglorious,  and  mourn  o'er  the  fate  of  my  comrades. 
Such  is  his  sov'reign  will  irresistible  !  who  when  it  pleased  him 
Many  a  proud  city's  lofty  defences  hath  humbled  already, 
Many  a  one  yet  will  humble:  for  uncontrolled  is  his  power.— 
Shame!  oh!  shame  will  it  seem  unto  all  who  shall  learn  it  hereafter, 
Such  and  so  mighty  a  force  to  have  warred  in  vain,  and  retreated  (120) 
Greeks  though  they  we?-e,  with  inferior  numbers  matched :  for  conclusion 
Other  than  this  see  I  none,  nor  sign  of  a  prosperous  issue. 
Yet  were  a  compact  made  to  decide  this  quarrel  by  numbers, 
Duly  confirmed  by  oath;  and  fairly  the  warriors  were  counted, 
Ranging  on  one  side  those  who  have  Troy  for  their  birthplace  and 

dwelling ; 
We  the  Achaians  collecting  in  groups  of  ten  on  the  other, — 
Then,  at  our  final  feast  were  each  man  for  a  cupbearer  taken, 
Many  a  decade  of  Greeks  must  want  its  Trojan  attendant. 
Thus,  I  say,  do  Achaia's  sons  out-number  the  Trojans, 
Reckoning  those  in  the  city  who  dwell.    But  besides,  there  are  spear- 
men (130) 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  27 

Num'rous  and  brave,  who  flock  to  their  aid  from  many  a  city. 
These  are  the  men  who  baffle  and  push  me  aside  from  my  purpose, 
Much  as  I  long  to  destroy  proud  Ilion's  populous  fortress. 
Nine  long  years  of  mighty  Zeus  have  lapsed,  and  the  timbers 
Rot  in  our  ships  as  they  stand,  and  the  ropes  hang  slack  and  untwisted ! 
While  in  their  dwellings  at  home  our  wives  and  innocent  children 
Listlessly  wait  our  return:  and  we,  meanwhile  have  effected 
Plainly  and  simply  nothing  of  all  we  came  to  accomplish. 
Then  let  us  act  at  once!    Attend  to  my  words  and  obey  them. 
Home  let  us  fly  with  our  ships,  and  seek  the  dear  land  of  our  Fathers. 
Never  will  Troy's  wide  streets  by  our  conquering  forces  be  entered. 

Thus  he  spake,  and  each  hearer's  heart  was  stirred  in  his  bosom : 
All  but  the  chiefs  who  knew  the  deep  design  of  his  counsel. 
All  the  assembly  was  moved ;  like  the  waves  which  swell  to  the  tempest 
Far  on  the  wide  Icarian  sea,  when  Eurus  and  Notus 
Burst  from  the  clouds  of  Father  Zeus,  and  roll  it  before  them. 
And  as  the  deep  and  full-eared  corn  when  swept  by  the  Zephyr 
Bows  to  the  coming  blast,    and  waves  and  sways  at  its  impulse, 
So  was  th'  assembly  swayed.     All  rushed  with  shouts  to  the  vessels, 
Trampling  aloft  the  dust  which  in  air  hung  canopied  o'er  them,      (150) 
Each  exhorting  his  fellows  with  cries  to  seize  on  the  gallies 
Drag  them  down  from  the  beach,  and  launch  them  at  once  on  the  Ocean. 
Soon  were  the  channels  cleared.     Then  the  shout  ascended  to  heaven, 
"Homeward!  Homeward!"   and  down  they  plucked  the  props  that 
sustained  them. 

Then,  in  despite  of  fate  had  the  Greeks  returned  to  their  country 
Had  not  Hera  these  words  addressed  to  Pallas  Athene: 
"What  then?  invincible  daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Kronion! 
Thus  shall  our  Argives  fly  to  the  dear-loved  land  of  their  fathers, 
Riding  inglorious  away  on  the  broad-ridged  waves  of  the  ocean? 
What !  shall  they  leave  to  Priam  the  triumph? — leave  to  the  Trojans  (160) 
Argive  Helen  herself;  that  prize  for  whom  many  a  Grecian 
There  on  the  plains  of  Troy  hath  perish'd,  far  from  his  country? 
Not  so!  Hie  thee  at  once  to  the  bronze-mailed  hosts  of  Achaia, 
Use  thy  persuasive  language  on  one  and  all,  and  restrain  them: 
Suffer  them  not  to  drag  to  the  sea  their  even-oared  vessels." 


28  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Thus  she  spake:  nor  delayed  the  blue-eyed  goddess  Athene. 
Down  she  darted  at  once  from  the  topmost  height  of  Olympus 
And  in  an  instant  reached  the  swift-sailing  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
There  she  encountered  Odysseus  the  wise,  Jove's  equal  in  counsel. 
Pierced  to  the  heart  and  soul  with  grief  he  stood,  nor  assisted      (170) 
Ev'n  with  a  touch  to  move  his  dark  and  well-equip't  galley.— 
Standing  beside  him,  thus  did  the  blue-eyed  goddess  address  him; 

"Heav'n-descended  son  of  Laertes!  wily  Odysseus! 
Shamefully  hurrying  to  man  the  close-ranged  banks  of  your  vessels 
Homeward  thus  will  ye  fly  to  the  dear-lov'd  land  of  your  fathers? 
What!  will  ye  leave  to  Priam  the  glory? — leave  to  the  Trojans 
Argive  Helen  herself;  that  prize  for  whom  many  a  Grecian 
Here  on  the  plains  of  Troy  hath  perish'd,  far  from  his  country? 
Haste  then !  Address  thee  at  once  to  the  bronze-mailed  hosts  of  Achaia; 
Use  thy  persuasive  language  on  one  and  all,  and  restrain  them.   (180) 
Suffer  them  not  to  drag  to  the  sea  their  even-oared  gallies." 

Thus  she  spake.     But  he  knew  the  celestial  voice  and  obeyed  it. 
Running  in  haste  he  cast  off  his  cloak,  which  Eurybates  watchful 
Caught  as  it  fell  ('twas  he  who  from  Ithaca  came,  as  a  herald). 
First,  in  his  course  encountering  Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon, 
He  from  the  king  his  sceptre  received,  enduring  and  stainless, 
Which  to  the  ships  he  bore  of  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia. 
Trusted  with  this,  when  he  chanced    on  some    Prince  or   chief  of 

distinction 
Thus,  arresting  his  speed,  with  persuasive  words  he  constrained  him  : 

"Strange!  that  a  man  such  as  thou  should  to  panic  yield,  like  a 
dastard.  (I9°) 

Take  thy  place,  a?id  steady  thy  men,  and  make  them  be  seated. 
For,  be  assured,  thou  know'st  not  yet  the  mind  of  Atreides. 
Now  he  but  tries,  but  will  soon  press  hard  on,  the  sons  of  Achaia. 
What  he  said  in  the  council,  alone  they  know  who  were  present. 
Now  'twill  be  well  if  he  wreak  not  his  rage  on  the  sons  of  the  Grecians. 
Dread  is  the  -wrath  of  a  king  who  to  Zeus  his  lineage  traces, 
Heav'n  will  maintain  his  honour,  and  Jove  is  his  friend  and  adviser." 
But  when  some  trooper  he  found,  some  base  and  bellowing  miscreaiit 
Him  with  the  sceptre  he  drove,  nor  spared  loud  words  of  invective. 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  29 

"Madman!   be    seated  and    quiet,    and   hear  -what   is    said    by   thy 
betters:  (200) 

'Tis  not  for  such  as  thou,  such  weak  and  dastardly  wretches, 
Either  to  count  in  the  ranks  as  men,  or  be  heard  in  the  council. 
What  then !  must  all  be  kings  who  call  themselves  Greeks,  in  our  army? 
One  king,  sure,  is  enough,  and  more  were  a  curse  to  the  nation: 
One,  by  mysterious  Kronos'  son  with  dominion  entrusted, 
Sceptre  and  lawful  rule,  that  he  reign  in  might  and  in  justice." 

Thus  by  his  voice  of  command  was  order  restored  in  the  army. 
Back  from  their  tents  and  ships  once  more  they  rushed  to  the  meeting 
Clam'ring ;  as  when  the  wide-resounding  swell  of  the  ocean 
Breaks  on  the  long  flatbeach,  and  the  sea's  rough  voice  is  uplifted.  (210) 

All  was  quiet  at  length,  and  all  were  seated  in  order, 
Only  Thersites  persisted  in  coarse  unmeasured  invective. 
Filled  to  the  throat  with  words  of  vulgar  abuse,  he  delighted 
Idly,  and  setting  at  naught  all  rule,  to  wrangle  with  Princes, 
Scoffing  at  all  their  acts,  and  seizing  each  subject  of  laughter. 
Ugliest  was  he  among  all  the  Greeks  who  at  Ilion  mustered  : 
Squinting:  of  one  foot  lame;  and  his  mountain  shoulders  projecting 
Pressed  on  his  chest  in  front :  while  scantly  peering  above  them 
Rose  to  a  peak  his  head,  with  thin  wool  sparingly  sprinkled. 
Such  was  the  man!     He  hated  Achilles  most,  and  Odysseus.        (220) 
Both  he  loved  to  revile  :  but  now,  on  divine  Agamemnon 
Fasfning,  he  screamed  forth  bitter  abuse,  which  the  generous  Grecians 
Heard  with  impatient  wrath,  and  scarce  suppressed  their  resentment. 
Howling  across  th'  assembly  with  words  like  these  he  assailed  him. 
"What  is  thy  grievance  now,  O  Atreides?    What  dost  thou  long  for? 
Crammed  are  thy  tents  with  brass ;  and  female  slaves,  whom  the  Grecians 
Carefully  choosing  from  all  their  spoil,  have  bestowed  on  their  Leader, 
There,  in  plenty,    are  found,  from    each  town  we  have  taken  and 

plundered. 
Hast  thou  a  craving  for  gold,  which  some  Trojan  tamer  of  horses 
Eager  to  ransom  his  son  (by  myself  or  some  other  Achaian  (230) 

Captured  and  bound  in  fight)  may  lay  at  thy  feet  from  his  treasure 7 
Say !  dost  thou  wish  for  a  damsel  with  whom  to  wanton  in  dalliance 
Keeping  her  close  shut  up  for  thyself  ?     Oh !  shame !  that  their  ruler 


3o  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Thus  to  defeat  and  mischief  should  lead  the  sons  of  Achaia. 
Women  of  Greece,  not  Greeks  !  imsexed,  disgraced,  and  enfeebled ! 
Home  I  say,  home,  let  us  haste  in  our  ships,  and  behind  us  in  Troia 
Leave  him  here  to  feed  on  his  honours.     So  shall  experience 
Teach  him  whether  he  need  our  aid  or  can  conquer  without  us: 
He  ! — who  but  now  Achilles,  a  man  far  nobler  and  braver, 
Foully  dishonoured;  and  holds  his  prize,  having  shamefully  robbed  him. 
Mild  is  Achilles  doubtless  by  nature,  bland  and  forbearing.      (241) 
Well  for  thee,  O  Atreides  !  or  that  were  the  last  of  thy  insults." 

Thus  insulting  Atreides,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people 
Spoke  Thersites.     Him  then  noble  Odysseus  approaching 
Eyed  with  indignant  looks,  and  harshly  reproving  addressed  him : 
"  Babbling  fool,  Thersites  !    Be  still,  thou  noisy  declaimer ! 
Ready  of  tongue  though  thou  be;  and  contend  not,  trifler,  with  Princes : 
For  I  assert  that  baser  than  thou,  no  mortal  among  us 
Here  can  be  found,  of  all  who  have  come  to  Troy  with  th'  Atreidae. 
Take  not  the  names  of  kings   in  thy  mouth  to  soil  and  blaspheme 
them.  (25°) 

Cease  from  thy  factious  abuse,  nor  expect  the  retreat  of  our  army. 
Time  and  events  will  decide  our  return.     Victorious  or  vanquished, 
That  to  the  Gods  we  leave,  nor  ask  thy  counsel  or  guidance. 
Atreus'  son  Agamemnon,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people 
Dat'st  thou  sit  there  and  revile  ?  and  vent  thy  spite  and  thy  envy. 
Grudginghim  all  the  wealth  which  the  Heroes  of  Greece  have  awarded? 
Hear  what  I  say,  and  what,  be  assured  will  be  fully  accomplished. 
Let  me  but  catch  thee  raving  again  in  this   insolent  fashion, 
And  may  the  head  of  Odysseus  no  longer  rest  on  his  shoulders, 
May  I  never  again  as  Telemachus'  father  be  greeted,  (260) 

Tear  I  not  from  thy  carcase  vile  each  rag  of  thy  garments, 
Cloak,  and  tunic,  and  all,  and  drive  thee,  naked  and  wailing, 
Sobbing  beneath  the  blows  I  shall  give  thee,  back  to  thy  vessel, 
Freeing  th'  assemblies  of  Greece  from  the  shame  and  disgrace  of  thy 
presence." 

Thus  Odysseus :  and  down  on  his  back  and  shoulders  the  sceptre 
Fell  with  a  sweep;  and  he  writhed,  and  the  tears  ran  fast  o'er  his  visage, 
While  on  his  back  a  tumour  arose,  all  livid  a?id  bleeding, 


Book  II.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Under  the  sceptre's  golden  weight.    Down  sate  he  and  trembled, 
Wiping  the  tears  from  his  face,  in  doleful  and  piteous  condition. 
Shocked  were  the  Greeks  at  first,  but  laughter  gained  the  ascendant  (270) 
While  each  man  to  his  neighbour  turning,  spoke  his  opinion  : 

"  Well  now !  many  a  worthy  deed  hath  Odysseus  accomplished, 
Excellent  plans  suggested,  and  roused  our  spirits  in  action. 
But  to  have  stopped  this  slanderer's  mouth  and  cut  short  his  reviling 
This  is  the  happiest  boon  he  hath  ever  conferred  on  the  Grecians. 
Surely,  methinks,  'twill  be  long  ere  his  headstrong  spirit  excite  him 
Madly  again  to  abuse  our  kings  with  scurrilous  language." 

Such  was  the  general  talk.     But  Odysseus,  razer  of  cities, 
Stood  with  the  sceptre  in  hand,  and  beside  him  blue-eyed  Athene 
Like  to  a  herald  in  form,  commanded  all  to  be  silent.  (280) 

So  that  each  man,  whether  distant  or  near,  of  the  sons  of  Achaia 
All  that  he  said  might  hear  and  well  consider  its  import. 
Sagely  he  spoke,  and  these  were  the  words  he  addressed  to  the  meeting. 

"Hapless  Atreides!     Now  will  this  acl  of thine  army  proclaim  thee 
Lowest  of  kings,  wherever  the  language  of  mortals  is  spoken  : 
Thus. do  the  Greeks  perform  that  oath  they  swore,  when  from  Argos 
Famedforits  steeds  they  sought  these  shores,  and  promised  to  bring  thee 
Back  triumphant,  the  razer  of  Troy's  embattled  defences  ! 
Hear,  how  with  wail  and  with  moan,  like  desolate  widows  and  orphans, 
One  to  another  they  cry  for  home,  sweet  home!  audits  comforts!  (2 go) 
Yet  is  it  grievous  and  hard  to  return  in  shame  and  in  suffering. 
Let  but  a  man  from  his  wife  for  a  single  month  be  divided: 
Doth  he  not  chafe  and  fret,  when  the  wintry  shriek  of  the  tempest 
Yells  round  his  many-bench'd  ship,  and  the  rough  sea  pens  him  in 

harbour? 
Therefore  I  blame  not  the  Greeks,  that,  for  nine  long  winters  revolving 
Here  at  their  ships  detained,  they  weary  and  chafe  with  impatience. 
But  to  have  staid  so  long,  and  now  to  retreat  on  a  sudden 
Empty-handed  and  foiled,  were  foul  defeat  and  dishonour. 
Therefore,  my  friends !  endure  to  the  end.     Let  us  stay  and  determine 
Whether  the  fates  by  Calchas  shewn,  be  truth  or  delusion.      (300) 
All  of  you  know  what  happened — each  man  here  present  can  witness 
(Each  who  from  day  to  day  through  the  chances  of  plague  and  of  battle

Struggling  on  has  survived)  when  at  Aulis  our  ships  were  assembled 
Ready  on  Troy  and  her  sons  to  launch  the  weight  of  our  vengeance, 
How  round  the  fount  we  gathered,  and  spotless  hecatombs  offered 
To  the  immortal  Gods,  full  heaped  on  many  an  altar, 
Under  a  beauteous  plane  which  the  limpid  source  overshadowed. 
Then  was  a  wond'rous  sign  displayed!      From  under  the  altars 
Glided  a  fearful  serpent,  his  back  all  spotted  with  purple ; 
Sent  up  to  light  by  Olympian  Zeus :  and  he  made  for  the  plane-tree.  (310) 
There  on  the  topmost  bough  the  unfledged  young  of  a  sparrow 
Eight  in  number  were  lodged,  close  under  the  foliage  nestling; 
She,  the  mother  herself  the  ninth,  who  had  hatched  and  who  fed  them. 
One  by  one,  their  piteous  cries  unheeding,  he  swallowed; 
While  round  the  nest  kept  hov'ring  the  mother,  lamenting  her  dear  ones, 
Her  too,  turning  his  head,  by  the  wing  he  seized,  and  devoured 
Screaming.    But  thus  having  slain  those  fledglings  all  and  their  mother, 
Fixed  he  remained,  as  a  visible  sign  of  the  God  who  had  sent  him, 
Suddenly  changed  to  stone  by  the  son  of  mysterious  Kronos. 
Wond'ring  what  this  might  mean,  as  we  stood  all  lost  in  amazement. 
Thus  by  miraculous  signs  to  behold  our  rites  interrupted;       (321) 
Calchas  at  once,  by  Heav'n  inspired,  this  oracle  uttered. 
'Why  are  ye  mute,  ye  crested  Greeks?     Why  stand  ye  astonished! 
Zeus  in  his  wisdom  and  might  this  prodigy  sends,  in  its  import 
Slow  of  unfolding ;  late  in  event ;  undying  in  glory. 
Ev'n  as  that  snake  devoured  the  nestlings  eight  of  the  sparrow, 
Her  too,  the  mother  herself  the  ninth,  who  had  hatched  and who fed 'them, 
Thus,  even  thus,  must  we  war  through  nine  long  years  on  the  Trojans, 
And  in  the  tenth  their  vast  and  stately  city  shall  capture.' 
Thus  was  the  oracle  told.    Just  now  we  behold  its  fulfilment.        (330) 
Stay  then,  ye  bright  armed  Greeks  but  awhile :  make  one  more  endeavoui- ; 
Surely  the  city  of  Priam  will  yield  at  length  to  your  valour." 

Thus  he  spake;  and  the  Argives  shouted  aloud,  and  the  vessels 
Rattled  and  rang  as  they  echoed  the  jubilant  shouts  of  th'  Achaians 
Yielding  tumultuous  assent  to  the  words  of  godlike  Odysseus. 
Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight  uprose  and  addressed  them. 
'Shame  on  ye  all!  Why  talk  ye  like  silly  and  impotent  children 
All  too  feeble  for  war  and  reckless  of  duty  and  honour?

What  shall  become  of  your  vows?  and  where  is  the  league  ye  have 

sworn  to? 
Into  the  flames  are  cast  each  high  resolve  and  each  counsel,  (340) 
All  the  libations,  the  pledged  right  hands,  and  the  oaths  that  we  trusted ! 
Idly  we  war  with  empty  words  and  mutual  reproaches. 
Counsel  or  conduct  is  none,  though  year  after  year  hath  been  wasted. 
But  O  Atreides!  do  thou,  in  thine  heart  unflinching,  as  ever, 
Hold  to  thy  purpose  firm,  and  lead  thy  Greeks  to  the  conflict. 
Let  those  few  seceders  who  dream  of  returning  to  Argos 
Ere  it  shall  clearly  appear  whether  Zeus  the  great  ^Egis-upholder 
Mean  to  fulfil  the  promise  he  gave,  or  intend  to  desert  us, 
Shrink  out  of  sight  and  of  mind;  for  success  shall  never  attend  them. 
For  I  assert,  such  promise  was  giv'n  by  the  mighty  Kronion  (350) 
Flashing  from  Heav'n  on  our  right  in  manifest  sign  of  approval, 
On  that  auspicious  day  when  the  Greeks  their  swift-sailing  vessels 
Launched  on  the  deep  and  embarked,  bearing  death  and  destruction  to 

Troia. 
Wherefore  at  once  dismiss  from  your  minds  all  thought  of  returning, 
Ere  that  day  when  each  Greek  shall  have  seized  the  wife  of  a  Trojan, 
Mindful  of  Helena's  tears  from  her  husband  torn,  and  her  sufferings. 
Should  there  be  one  so  madly  bent  on  flight  and  desertion; 
Let  him  but  grasp  a  rope,  or  lay  hands  on  an  oar  of  his  vessel, 
And  be  the  first  among  us  to  meet  that  doom  he  would  fly  from. 
Now,  then,  bethmk  thee  well  O  King!  and  take  counsel  of  others, (360) 
Nor  let  the  words  I  speak  fall  unregarded  upon  thee. 
Let  thy  troops,  Agamemnon,  by  tribes  and  clanships  be  mustered; 
Tribe  by  tribe  be  supported,  and  clansman  encouraged  by  clansman. 
So  shalt  thou  judge,  if  thus  thou  direct,  and  the  Greeks  shall  obey  thee, 
Which  are  the  dastard  chiefs,  and  which  of  their  soldiers  a  coward, 
Which,  too,  noble  and  brave :  for  they  fight  in  the  sight  of  their  kinsmen. 
Then  thou  shalt  know,  should  Troy  not  fall,  whether  Fate  have  pre- 
served it, 
Or  the  degenerate  Greeks  have  lost  their  skill  and  their  courage." 

Thus  making  answer  returned  the  ruler  of  men  Agamemnon, 
"Now,  as  at  all  times,  wise,  thou  excell'st  all  others  in  council;    (370) 
O!  might  our  Father  Zeus,  and  Apollo  and  Pallas  Athene 


34  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Grant  me  but  ten  such  men  in  our  host,  to  advise  and  assist  me, 
Soon  would  the  mighty  city  of  Priam  the  King,  to  their  wisdom 
Yield,  oer'mastered  and  ruined,  a  prey  to  our  conquering  armies. 
Zeus  son  of  Kronos,  the  ^Egisbearer,  however,  hath  sent  me 
Hardship  and  grief,  and  in  vain  contention  and  strife  hath  involved  me. 
Wrangling  with  mighty  Achilles  I  stood,  for  the  sake  of  a  damsel. 
Bitter,  and  harsh  were  our  words :  and  {own  it  I  must)  I  began  it. 
Should  we  again  be  friends,  and  in  heart  united,  no  longer 
Would  the  destruction  of  Troy  be  deferred — no,  not  for  an  instant.  (380) 
Go  then,  ye  warriors.     Strengthen  yourselves  with  food  for  the  combat : 
Each  man  sharpen  his  spear  and  adjust  the  thongs  of  his  buckler: 
Each  to  his  swift-footed  steeds  give  plenty of  nourishing  fodder. 
Mindful  of  war's  rude  shock,  let  each  look  well  to  his  chariot, 
So  that  a  long  day's  fight  may  find  nought  weak  or  deficient. 
For,  be  assured,  not  a  moment's  pause  nor  truce  will  be  granted 
Till  intervening  night  shall  part  the  fierce  rage  of  the  heroes. 
Bathed  in  sweat  be  each  bosom  beneath  its  sheltering  buckler! 
Each  brave  hand  grow  weary  and  stiff  with  grasping  the  jav'lin ! 
"Whirling  the  polished  car,  each  steed  must  pant  with  exertion.     (390) 
He,  whomsoe'er  I  shall  see,  avoiding  the  fight  like  a  recreant, 
Skulking  to  shelter  his  fear  in  the  darksome  hold  of  his  vessel, 
Trust  me,  shall  find  it  hard  to  escape  the  dogs  and  the  vultures." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  Argives  shouted  aloud :  as  the  breakers 
Rave  upon  some  steep  shore  when  by  Notus  lashed  into  fury 
Round  a  far-jutting  crag,  which  the  wild  waves  never  relinquish 
Drifted  upon  it  by  every  wind,  from  every  quarter. 
Rising  in  haste  they  dispersed  to  their  ships  and  tents ;  and  among  them 
Each  man  kindled  his  fire  and  cooked  his  meal,  and  consumed  it. 
Each  to  the  God  of  his  choice  preferred  his  prayers  and  oblatiofts  (400) 
In  the  impending  fight  to  guard  him  from  death  and  destruction. 
But  Agamemnon,  king  of  men  to  mighty  Kromon 
Offered  a  steer  of  five  years  age,  well  fattened;  and  summoned 
Each  of  the  noblest  chieftains  of  Greece,  her  elders  in  council, 
Nestor  the  first,  Idomeneus  next,  the  sov'reign  of  Creta; 
Thither  each  Aias  came,  with  Tydeus'  son,  Diomedes; 
Sixth  in  order  Odysseus  the  wise,  Jove's  equal  in  council.

But  Menelaiis  unbidden  attended  (whose  shout  in  the  battle 
Rose  above  all)  for  he  shared  each  care,  each  grief,  of  his  brother. 
These  surrounded  the  steer  and  upheaved  the  salt  and  the  barley  (410) 
While  Agamemnon  ruler  of  men  thus  prayed  from  amidst  them : 
"Zeus!  most  great,  most  glorious,who  dwellest  in  clouds  and  in  darkness, 
Grant  me,  ere  set  of  sun,  ere  night  shall  have  closed  on  our  armies, 
Down  to  the  earth  to  cast  the  high  roof  of  the  palace  of  Priam 
Smould'ring  in  fire;  and   consume  its  gates  with  the  torch  of  my 

vengeance ! 
Grant  me  to  hew  from  his  bosom  the  brazen  armour  of  Hector 
Shattered,  and  torn  by  my  conqu'ring  sword;  and  let  many  a  comrade 
Prostrate,  biting  the  ground,  in  the  dust  lie  scattered  around  him." 
Thus  he  prayed.     But  Kronion  received  not  his  prayer,  nor  fulfilled  it  j 
Though  he  accepted  the  homage.  And  toil  upon  toil  he  redoubled.  (420) 
But  when  the  prayer  was  ended,  the  meal  on  the  victims  they  sprinkled. 
Turned  up  their  heads  to  heav'n  and  slew  them;  flayed,  and  divided. 
Sev'ring  the  thighs,  they  wrapped  them  in  cauls  of  fat,  and  about  them 
Doubled  the  folds,  and  morsels  attached  from  each  part  of  the  carcase, 
These  with  leafless  billets  of  wood  they  burned,  and  the  entrails 
Fixing  on  forks  o'er  the  mounting ■flames  they  held,  and  consumed  them. 
Then  (when  the  thighs  were  burned,  and  the  entrails  formally  tasted) 
Cut  into  pieces  the  rest,  transfixed,  and  skilfully  roasted; 
Drew  them  from  off  the  spits,  and  served  for  meat  on  the  tables. 
Now  was  the  rite  concluded,  the  banquet  spread,  and  they  feasted  (430) 
Each  to  his  soul's  content;  nor  lacked  there  abundant  provision. 
But  when  the  cravings  of  hunger  and  thirst  at  length  were  abated, 
Nestor  arose — the  Gerenian  knight,  and  thus  he  addressed  them: 
"  Atreus'  son,  most  noble  !     Thou  king  of  men,  Agamemnon  ! 
Let  us  not  waste  our  time  in  empty  talk;  but  in  earnest 
Haste  without  farther  delay  to  accomplish  the  mission  of  Heaven  : 
Now  to  the  work !    Let  the  heralds  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia 
Summon  to  meet  full  armed  at  the  ships.    Then  proceed  we  together, 
Traversing  all  the  long-drawn  lines  of  the  host,  and  exciting 
All,  with  their  utmost  speed  to  prepare  for  desperate  conflict."     (44°) 

Thus  he  spake,  nor  delayed  the  king  of  men  Agamemnon; 
Soon  was  his  order  giv'n  to  the  shrill-voiced  heralds,  to  summon

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  II. 


All  the  array  of  the  crested  Greeks  to  make  ready  for  battle. 
Soon  was  the  order  announced  and  quickly  the  troops  were  assembled. 
Then  through  the  ranks  Atreides  passed,  with  the  sov'reigns  around  him, 
Stationing  each  in  its  place  :  and  beside  them  blue-eyed  Athene 
Lifted  her  ^Egis  on  high,  undecaying,  immortal,  and  precious, 
Which  with  an  hundred  tassels  of  gold  was  fringed  at  its  margin 
Wondrously  twisted  and  wrought,  and  each  of  a  hecatomb's  value. 
Fiercely  glaring,  with  this  she  rushed  through  the  host  of  the  Grecians  (45  o) 
Urging  them  on  \  and  infused  fresh  strength  into  every  bosom 
And  the  determined  resolve  to  fight  to  the  last  and  to  conquer. 
Sweeter  by  far  to  their  hearts  was  now  the  prospect  of  battle 
Than  to  return  in  their  ships  to  the  dear-loved  land  of  their  fathers. 
\   As  when  some  forest  vast  on  the  lofty  crest  of  a  mountain 
Burns  with  devouring  fire,  and  lightens  the  regions  around  it ; 
So,  as  the  troops  advanced,  from  the  beaming  brass  of  their  armour 
Flashed  to  the  sky  through  the  air  an  all-illumining  splendour. 
Countless  they  came  as  when  flocks  of  fowl  in  the  marshes  of  Asius 
Geese,  or  cranes,  or  long-necked  swans,  by  the  streams  of  Cayster  (460) 
Wheel  in  uncertain  flight,  now  here,  now  there,  and  disporting 
Winnow  the  air  with  their  wings,  and  with  loud  cries  sweep  der  the  waters 
Till  they  at  once  alight,  and  the  mead  resounds  with  their  clamour: 
So  from  their  ships  and  tents  poured  forth  the  gathering  nations 
On  the  Scamandrian  plain.     Loud  groaned  the  earth  as  it  trembled 
Under  the  feet  of  men  and  of  horses  must  'ring  for  battle. 
So  too  by  myriads  they  stood  on  the  flowery  mead  of  Scamander 
Thick  as  the  blossoms  and  leaves  which  spring  pours  forth  in  her  bounty. 
And  as  the  buzzing  swarms  of  flies  that  clustering  hover 
Chasing  each  other  around  some  shepherd's  pen,  in  the  spring-tide  (470) 
(What  time  the  milk  is  sweet  and  rick,  and  the  pails  overflowing), 
Not  less  numberless  stood  the  long-hair'd  sons  of  Achaia 
Eager  to  close  in  fight,  and  break  through  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans. 
These,  as  some  skilful  herdsman  his  goats  selects  and  assembles 
When  in  a  mingled  crowd  they  spread  confused  o'er  the  pasture, 
Not  with  less  ease  their  leaders  collect  and  array  for  the  combat, 
Each  in  his  rank  a?id  place;  Agamemnon  tow'ring  among  them 
Like  unto  thundering  Zeus  in  his  beaming  eyes  and  his  forehead;

Ares  in  waist ;  and  Poseidon  in  breadth  of  chest  and  of  shoulders. 
And  as  a  bull  stalks  forth  in  advance  of  his  herd  in  the  meadows  (480) 
Proud  in  his  might,  and  in  lordly  strength  all  others  excelling; 
So  by  the  hand  of.  Zeus  with  surpassing  glory  invested 
Stepped  forth  Atreides  on  that  great  day,  supreme  among  heroes?; 

Tell  me,  ye  Muses  !     Ye#  who  the  halls  of  Olympus  inhabit — 
(Goddesses  are  ye,  and  present  at  each  great  deed,  and  behold  it. 
We  but  gather  from  vague  report,  and  of  nothing  are  certain) — 
Who  were  the  Rulers  of  Greece,  and  who  her  commanders  in  battle. 
Were,  for  the  task,  ten  tongues,  ten  mouths,  ten  voices  accorded 
All  unwearied  with  speech,  and  with  brazen  lungs  were  I  gifted, 
Ne'er  could  I  count  the  number  or  name  the  names  of  her  warriors,  (490) 
Did  not  the  Muses,  the  ^Egis-bearer's  Olympian  daughters, 
Bring  to  my  mind  the  long  list  of  those  who  at  Ilion  mustered, 

Now  I  recite  the  ships,  and  the  ships'1  commanders  in  order. 


The  Catalogue  of  the  Ships  and  Forces. 

Peneleus  first  and  Le'itus  led  the  Boeotian  squadrons, 
Arcesilaus  next:  with  these,  Prothoenor  and  Clonius 
Under  them,  those  in  Hyrie  bred,  and  precipitous  Aulis, 
Schcenus  and  Scolus  too,  and  the  rough  Eteonian  passes, 
Those  whom  Thespia  nurtured,  and  Graia,  and  wide  Mycalessus, 
Those  near  Harma  who  dwelt,  th'  Ilesian  fens,  and  Erythrag, 
Eleon,  and  those,  besides,  who  in  Hyla  and  Peteon  harboured,    (500) 
Or  in  Ocalea  dwelt,  or  in  Medeon's  impregnable  fortress, 
Thisbe,  famed  for  its  breed  of  doves,  Eutresis  and  Copse, 
And  Coronfea's  slope,  and  the  meadows  of  green  Haliartus ; 
Those  who  possessed  Platsea  and  those  who  inhabited  Glissa 
And  who  maintained  in  its  strength  Hypothebe's  fortified  city; 
Those  of  Oncastus'  beauteous  groves,  where  Poseidon  is  worshipped, 
Those  who  rich  Arne's  vine-clad  hills  possessed,  and  Mideia, 
Nissa's  sacred  shrines  and  Anthedon's  remoter  recesses. 
These  were  transported  in  fifty  ships,  and  in  each  of  the  vessels 
Six-score  Boeotian  youths  embarked  for  Ilion's  conquest.  (510) 

From  Minyrean  Orchomenos  those,  and  the  men  of  Aspledon 


38  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Were  by  Ascalaphus  led  and  Ialmenus,  offspring  of  Ares, 
Both  by  Astyoche  borne  to  the  God,  who  secretly  wooed  her 
Under  the  roof  of  her  father,  Azeidean  Actor ;  a  virgin 
Pure  until  then,  and  stainless. — All  these,  in  order  embarking, 
Thirty  vessels  conveyed  in  their  hollow  keels  o'er  the  ocean. 

Schedius  next  to  these,  and  Epistrophus  led  the  Phocseans 
Sons  of  the  great  descendant  of  Naubolus,  valiant  Iphitus. 
All  who  in  rock-strown  Python  dwelt,  and  around  Cyparissus, 
All  who  from  Crissa  the  holy,  from  Panope  came,  and  from  Daulis;  (520) 
Those  in  Anemorasa,  and  those  in  Hyampolis  nurtured, 
All  who  inhabit  the  banks  of  the  sacred  river  Cephisus, 
All  the  Lilasans  besides,  from  Cephisus'  sources  assembled, 
Followed  in  forty  sable  ships  these  chiefs  to  the  warfare; 
And  when  by  these  arranged,  and  duly  disposed  in  their  order, 
On  the  Boeotians'  left  in  camp  and  in  battle  were  stationed. 

Then  came  the  Locrians  led  by  the  swift  Oilean  Aias; 
Aias  the  less — far  less  than  the  great  Telamonian  Hero 
Whether  in  stature  or  strength :  yet  small  as  he  was  (and  his  corslet 
Quilted  with,  linen  alone)  as  a  spearman,  none  could  excel  him.    (530) 
Under  him  sailed  the  men  of  Calliarus,  Opus,  and  Cynos, 
Scarphe  and  Bessa's  groves,  and  the  lovely  fields  of  Augaea, 
Tarpha,  and  Thronius'  mead  by  the  streams  of  Boagrius  watered. 
Locrians  these  from  the  coast  beyond  Euboea  the  sacred, 
Followed  in  forty  sable  ships  in  the  train  of  their  leader. 

Next  the  Euboean  Abantes,  high  panting  with  generous  ardour, 
Men  from  Eretria,  Chalcis,  and  rich  Histaeia's  vineyards, 
Men  from  Cerinthus'  shore,  and  the  rock-built  city  of  Dion, 
Those  who  possessed  Carystus,  and  those  who  inhabited  Styra, 
These  Elephenor  led,  the  lord  of  the  noble  Abantes,  (540) 

Great  Chalcodon's  son,  who  from  Ares  his  lineage  boasted. 
Swiftly  rushing  to  battle,  their  long  hair  streaming  behind  them, 
Charged  all  his  followers  bold,  each  skilled  through  breastplate  and  corslet 
Driving  his  tough  ash  spear,  to  pierce  to  the  heart  of  his  foeman. 
Forty  sable  vessels  transported  these  o'er  the  ocean. 

Next  in  order  were  those  whom  the  stately  city  of  Athens 
Sent  from  its  walls  to  the  war — the  city  of  noble-  Erechtheus, 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  39 

Sprung  from  the  teeming  furrow,  by  Pallas,  the  Thunderer's  daughter, 
Nurtured  and  cherished  and  placed  in  her  own  magnificent  temple; 
There,  where  th 'Athenian  youth  with  bulls  and  lambs  at  her  altar  (550) 
Pay  him  their  annual  vows,  and  adore  him  with  prayers  and  oblations. 
These  by  Menestheus,  Petion's  warlike  son,  were  commanded, 
Equal  to  whom  no  chief  upon  earth  was  found,  in  arraying 
Horses  and  shielded  troops,  and  disposing  them  sagely  for  battle, 
None,  save  Nestor  alone,  for  his  years  and  experience  were  greater. 
These  in  a  squadron  of  fifty  vessels  were  borne  o'er  the  waters. 

Salamis  sent  twelve  ships  with  the  great  Telamonian  Aias : 
These  he  arranged  in  order  beside  the  Athenian  phalanx. 

Those  who  inhabited  Argos,  Hermione,  fortified  Tiryns, 
Eione,  Trcezene,  and,  famed  for  its  vines,  Epidaurus,  (560) 

(Cities  which  Asine's  deep-indented  inlet  encircles); 
Those  who,  Achaians  by  birth,  possessed  ^Egina  and  Mases, 
Those  Diomedes,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  commanded. 
Sthenelus,  Capaneus'  son,  the  delight  and  pride  of  his  father 
Came,  with  Euryalus,  godlike  in  strength,  but  third  in  precedence. 
(Great  Mecisteus'  son,  and  king  Talai'on's  grandson. 
Both  co?nmanders,  both  under  warlike  Diomed  serving. 
Fourscore  sable  ships  their  followers  bore  der  the  waters. 

Next  came  the  men  of  Mycenae  adorned  with  magnificent  temples, 
Those  too  of  rich  Corinthus,  and  those  of  stately  Cleonae,       (570) 
Beauteous  Araethureia's  fields  and  the  groves  of  Orneia, 
Sicydn,  where  erst  Adrastus  reigned  in  the  days  of  his  splendour, 
Fair  Hyperesia's  plains,  and  high,  rock-perched  Gonoessa; 
Those  who  possessed  Pellene,  and  those  whom  zEgius  nurtured, 
Those  on  the  coast  who  dwelt,  where  Helice  slopes  to  the  seaward. 
There  in  an  hundred  ships  the  Prince  Agamemnon  assembled 
Atreus'  son.     In  numbers  surpassing  all,  as  in  valour 
Mustered  his  force.     Himself  in  refulgent  arms  and  in  glory 
Consciously  first,  and  proudly  preeminent,  moved  among  heroes, 
Bravest  where  all  were  brave,  and  mightiest,  where  many  were  mighty.  (5  80) 

Warriors  from  wide  Lacedaemon's  defiles  and  hollow  recesses, 
Phare,  Sparta,  and  Messa  where  doves  unceasingly  murmur, 
Fair  Bryseia's  domain,  and  the  charming  fields  of  Augeia, 


4o  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IT. 

Those  in  Amycle  bred,  and  the  sea-girt  city  of  Helos, 
Those  who  inhabited  Laas  and  those  whom  CEtylus  nurtured, 
These  Menelaus,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  commanded: 
Threescore  ships  they  filled;  but  they  sailed  apart  from  his  brother's. 
La?ided,  he  flew  through  their  ranks,  each  soul  with  ardour  inspiring 
Fierce  as  his  own:  for  his  heart  was  burning  within  him  for  vengeance, 
Vengeance  for  Helena's  tears,  from  his  bosom  torn,  and  her  suff'rings.  (590) 

Those  who  in  Pylos  dwelt,  and  the  beauteous  plains  of  Arene, 
Thryos,  hard  by  the  fords  of  Alphaeus,  and  ^Epy  the  stately, 
Those  who  in  Cyparisseis  and  Amphigeneia  were  nurtured, 
Pteleus  also,  and  Helos,  and  Dorium;  there  where  the  Muses 
Thamyris  met,  the  Thracian  bard  from  GEchalia's  frontier, 
Journeying  homeward  by  Eurytus'  stream,  and  rendered  him  songless. 
Vain  of  his  skill,  he  dared  defy  the  Olympian  sisters, 
Vaunting  himself  for  more  than  their  match  in  the  art  of  the  minstrel. 
They,  at  the  boast  indignant,  withdrew  the  gifts  they  had  lavished, 
Blasted  his  sight,  and  blotted  the  light  of  song  from  his  spirit.  (600) 
These  the  Gerenian  horseman  Nestor  led  to  the  combat; 
Fourscore  and  ten  were  the  hollow  ships  which  bore  them  to  Troia. 

Next  came  Arcadia's  sons,  from  the  skirts  of  lofty  Cyllene 
Near  unto  ^Epytus'  tomb :  men  prompt  with  their  foemen  to  grapple ; 
Those  from  Pheneus,  those  from  rich  Orchomenos'  pastures, 
Ripe,  and  Stratie  too,  and  the  breezy  heights  of  Enisp6, 
Those  in  Tegea  who  dwelt,  and  in  fair  Mantinea's  vallies, 
On  the  Stymphalian  plain,  and  on  snowy  Parrhasia's  uplands; 
These  Agapenor  led,  the  princely  son  of  Ancseus. 
Threescore  ships  they  filled,  and  in  each  were  Arcadian  warriors  (610) 
Num'rous  and  brave,  well  tried  in  the  practice  of  war  and  its  hardships. 
Ships  of  their  own  they  had  none.   With  these  Agamemnon  supplied  them, 
Fully  equipt  o'er  the  dark  blue  waves  to  bear  them  in  safety. 
All  unused  as  they  were  to  the  sea,  and  the. craft  of  the  seaman. 

Those  from  Buprasium  next  and  the  sacred  city  of  Elis, 
All  from  between  Hyrmine*  and  Myrsinus'  uttermost  frontier 
Up  to  th'  Olenian  rock  and  the  bounding  stream  of  Aleisus. 
These  in  forty  ships  four  leaders  followed,  in  squadrons 
Ten  under  each,  and  many  Epeians  mustered  on  board  them. 


Book  II.]  THE  ILTAD  OF  HOMER.  41 

One  by  Amphimachus,  Cteatus'  son,  was  conducted,  another  (620) 
Thalpius,  Eurytus'  son  and  grandson  of  Actor,  commanded; 
Brave  Diores  the  third,  Amaryncus'  son ;  and  the  squadron 
Fourth  in  order  divine  Polyxeinus  brought  o'er  the  ocean: 
Noble  Agasthenes'  son,  and  grandson  of  royal  Augseas. 

Those  from  Dulichium, — those  from  the  sacred  isles  of  Echinse 
Dwellers  across  the  water,  from  opposite  Elis  divided, 
Followed  the  fortunes  of  Meges,  a  warrior  equal  to  Ares, 
Son  of  the  bold  knight  Phyleus,  beloved  of  Zeus;  who  impatient 
Under  his  father's  control,  to  Dulichium  fled  for  protection, 
Whence,  with  forty  ships,  he  joined  the  array  of  the  Grecians.    (630) 

Noble  Odysseus  led  the  brave  Cephalenian  warriors, 
Those  who  in  Ithaca  dwelt  and  in  Neritus'  quivering  forests, 
Those  who  around  Crocyleia  and  rugged  ^Egilips  harboured, 
Who  in  Zacynthus  dwelt  and  the  Samian  isle,  and  the  region 
Ranging  along  th'  opposing  mainland  coast  of  Epirus, 
These  were  the  men  by  Odysseus  led,  Jove's  equal  in  counsel. 
Twelve  in  number  his  ships ;  whose  sides  with  vermilion  were  painted. 

Thoas,  Andrasmon's  son,  ^Etolia's  forces  commanded; 
Those  from  Pleuron,  from  Olenos  those,  and  those  of  Pylene, 
Chalcis  close  on  the  sea,  and  Calydon's  rocky  recesses.  (640) 

Passed  from  life  were  the  sons  of  magnanimous  CEneus ;  their  father 
Seen  upon  earth  no  more,  nor  the  fair-hair'd  chief  Meleager; 
Therefore  to  Thoas'  sway  was  ^Etolia's  sceptre  intrusted  : 
Forty  sable  ships  conveyed  his  troops  o'er  the  ocean. 

Next  by  Idomeneus  led,  came  the  ivarlike  host  of  the  Cretans. 
Those  from  Gnossus  and  strong  Gortyn&amp;'s  fortified  precincts 
Lyctus,  Miletus  too,  and  the  white-gleaming  walls  of  Lycastus, 
Phaestus,  and  Rhytium,  towns  in  wealth  and  in  people  abounding: 
These  and  each  beside  of  the  hundred  cities  of  Creta 
Sent  forth  their  sons,  by  Idomeneusled,  the  redoubtable  spearman,  (650) 
Joined  with  Merion,  brave  as  the  God  of  war  in  the  battle; 
Fourscore  sable  ships  these  warriors  conveyed  o'er  the  waters. 

Next  came  Tlepolemus  brave,  in  strength  and  stature  excelling: 
Hercules'  son.     Nine  ships  of  warriors  fierce  he  commanded 
Sent  by  the  three  confederate  Rhodian  states,  Ialyssus, 


42  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Lindus,  and  fair  Cameirus,  whose  walls  gleam  white  in  the  sunbeam. 
These  Tlepolemus  led,  that  bold  and  redoubtable  spearman. 
Him  fair  Astyocheia  bore  to  the  might  of  Herakles, 
Whom  from  the  smoking  ruins  of  many  a  populous  city 
Captive  he  carried  from  Ephyre's  land,  and  the  stream  of  Sellei's.  (660) 
Young  Tlepolemus,  grown  to  man's  estate  in  the  palace, 
Straightway  his  father's  maternal  uncle,  a  scion  of  Ares 
Ancient  Licymnius,  slew,  whom  his  father  loved;  and  a  navy 
Building  in  haste,  escaped  with  an  host  of  followers,  flying 
Far  o'er  the  seas — for  he  dreaded  the  threats  and  wrath  of  his  brothers, 
And  of  their  sons,  and  the  powerful  house  of  mighty  Herakles. 
Hardships  many  they  bore,  till  in  Rhodes  they  finally  landed; 
There,  divided  in  tribes,  three  cities  they  built ;  and  Kronion, 
Ruler  of  Gods  and  men,  looked  down  with  favour  upon  them, 
Prospered  their  handy  work,  and   poured  on  them  wealth  in  abun- 
dance. (670) 

Nireus  three  trim  gallies  from  Syme  led  o'er  the  ocean, 
Nireus,  of  royal  Charopus  born  and  graceful  Aglaia, 
Nireus  !  the  goodliest  man  of  the  Greeks  who  at  Ilion  mustered 
(Save  Peleides  alone,  the  faultless  in  form  and  in  feature), 
Feeble  albeit  in  fight,  and  few  the  troops  he  commanded. 

Those  in  Nisyrus  who  dwelt,  in  Crapathus  also  and  Casos, 
And  in  Calydna's  isles,  and  in  Cos,  Eurypylus'  city; 
These  by  Pheidippus  and  Antiphus,  warlike  brothers,  commanded, 
Thessalus'  sons, — a  prince  of  the  great  Heracleidean  lineage  : 
Thirty  ships  their  followers  bore  o'er  the  desolate  ocean.  (680) 

Now  must  I  tell  of  those  who  dwelt  in  Pelasgian  Argos, 
Those  from  Alos,  from  Alope  those,  and  those  of  Trechin6, 
Phthia,  and  Hellas  famed  as  the  land  of  beautiful  women. 
Myrmidons  those,  but  these  were  Hellenes  called  and  Achaians, 
Following  in  fifty  ships  the  fortunes  of  noble  Achilles. 
All  unmindful  of  war  were  they  now,  and  the  din  of  the  battle; 
Chief  was  there  none  to  marshall  their  ranks  and  lead  them  to  glory. 
Mighty  Achilles,  swift  in  the  race,  lay  aloof  a?id  indignant, 
Close  in  his  ships;  embittered  by  rage  for  the  fair-hair'd  Briseis 
Whom  fromLyrnessus  he  bore;  after  many  a  desperate  struggle    (690) 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  43 

Sacking  the  town,  and  destroying  the  walls  and  city  of  Thebe. 
There  Mynetes  he  struck  to  the  earth  and  Epistrophus,  spearmen 
Stalwart,  Evenius'  sons,  of  the  royal  line  of  Selepias: 
Now  was  he  plunged  in  grief — but  soon  to  arise  in  his  fury. 

Those  who  in  Phylace  dwelt  and  in  Pyrrhasus'  flowery  borders, 
Sacred  to  Ceres ; — Iton,  the  nurse  of  flocks  and  their  shepherds, 
Antron  close  to  the  sea,  and  the  rich  Pteleian  pastures, 
Were  by  Protesilaiis,  while  yet  surviving,  commanded. 
He  now,  alas  !  in  the  darksome  earth  reposed,  and  his  widow 
Tearing  her  hair  was  left,  her  cheeks  all  furrowed  and  bleeding    (700) 
There  in  his  half-finished  palace  at  Pylace.     First  of  the  Grecians 
Bravely  he  leaped  from  his  ship,  and  fell  by  the  lance  of  a  Trojan. 
Not  that  a  leader  they  lacked  though  grieved  for  the  loss  of  their  chieftain. 
Now  they  obeyed  Podarces  brave,  a  scion  of  Ares, 
Own  dear  brother  by  birth  of  magnanimous  Protesilaiis, 
Grandson  of  Phylaiis  wealthy  in  flocks,  and  son  of  Iphiclus. 
Both  were  brave,  but  Protesilaiis  the  elder  and  braver : 
Both  were  leaders  of  worth,  and  the  troops  with  their  j  'outhful  commander 
Cheerfully  served,  though  regretting  the  chief  who  formerly  led  them. 
Forty  sable  vessels  conveyed  this  force  der  the  ocean.  (l10) 

Those  who  in  Pherae  dwelt,  on  the  Bcebian  lake,  and  the  city 
Bcebe,  and  Glaphyrae  too,  and  the  neat-built  town  of  Iolchus, 
These  in  elev'n  dark  ships  embarked  and  were  led  by  Eumelus, 
Dearly  beloved  by  his  parents  Admetus  and  heavenly  Alcestis, 
Fairest  in  feature  and  form  of  all  the  daughters  of  Pelias. 

Those  in  Thaumasia  bred,  and  those  who  dwelt  in  Methone, 
Who  Meliboea  possessed,  and  the  rugged  heights  of  Olizon, 
These  under  Philocletes,  renowned  for  his  archery,  mustered; 
Sev'n  were  the  ships  they  filled,  and  in  each  the  rowers  were  fifty, 
Skilled  with  unerring  aim  to  deal  forth  the  shafts  of  destruction.  (720) 
He,  their  chief  meanwhile,  lay  groaning  in  anguish  and  helpless ; 
Left  by  the  Greeks  on  Lemnos'  sacred  isle,  on  their  passage, 
Struck  well-nigh  unto  death  by  the  venomed  fangs  of  a  serpent. 
Grieving  he  lay :  but  the  time  was  at  hand  when  Greece  should  remember 
Him  they  had  left  to  pi?ie,  a?id  long  for  their  lost  Philocletes. 
Yet  uncommanded  his  troops  were  not,  though  grieved  at  his  absence; 


44  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Medon,  bastard  son  of  Oileus,  led  them  to  battle, 
Medon,  by  Rhene  born  to  Oi'leus,  razer  of  cities. 

Those  who  from  Tricca  came,  and  the  rugged  crags  of  Ithome, 
Those  in  CEchalia  born,  by  CEchalian  Eurytus  governed,  (730) 

Those  Podalirius  join'd  with  Machaon,  skilful  physicians, 
Led  to  the  war; — two  brothers,   divine  Asclepias'  offspring. 
These  in  a  squadron  of  thirty  ships  were  transported  to  Troia. 

Those  in  Ormenium  bred  and  around  Hypereia's  fountain, 
Those  upon  Titanus'  snow-clad  heights  and  Asterium  nurtured, 
Were  by  Eurypylus  led,  the  valiant  son  of  Evaemon : 
Him  they  followed,  in  forty  sable  ships  der  the  ocean. 

Those  whom  Argissa,  those  Gyrtone  sent  to  the  army, 
Orthe,  Elone,  and  thy  white-gleaming  walls,  Oloosson : 
Those  Polypcetes  mighty  and  stern  in  battle  commanded.         (740) 
Him  to  PeirithoUs,  son  of  Zeus,  the  renowned  among  women 
Hippodameia  bore,  on  the  selfsame  day  when  Peirithous 
Routed  the  shaggy  Centaurs,  and  forth  from  their  caves,  and  the  forests 
Waving  on  Pelion's  sides,  unto  wild  ^Ethicia  drove  them. 
Nor  was  he  sole  in  command.     Leonteus,  scion  of  Ares, 
Fought  by  his  side,  the  son  of  Coronus,  and  grandson  of  Caeneus : 
Forty  vessels  their  followers  bore  der  the  desolate  ocean. 

Twenty  and  two    were  the  ships  under  Guneus  from  Cyphus   as- 
sembled ; 
These  th'  Enienians  filled,  and  the  warriors  bold  of  Peraebe, 
Those  whom  Dodona's  oaks  scarce  screened  from  her  pitiless  tempests, 
Those  in  the  region  who  dwelt  where  fair  Titaresius  gliding    (751) 
Pours  into  Peneus'  stream  his  pure  and  crystalline  waters. 
All  unmixed  with  its  silvery  flood,  like  oil  on  the  surface 
Floating,  their  seaward  course  they  pursue :  for  in  Styx  is  their  fountain, 
Pledge  of  that  dreadful  oath  by  the  Gods  revered  and  by  mortals. 

Prothoiis  last,  Tenthredon's  son,  renowned  for  his  fleetness, 
Led  the  Magnetian  bands,  who  from  Peneus'  flowery  margin 
Came,  and  from  Pelion's  shaggy  sides  and  quivering  forests  : 
Him  they  followed  in  forty  sable  ships  der  the  ocean. 

These  were  the  Princes  of  Greece,  and  these  the  chief  of  her  armies  (760) 
Now,  then,  recite  O  Muse !  among  all  who  came  with  th'  Atreidae 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  45 

Which  were  the  bravest  chiefs,  and  the  most  renowned  of  their  horses. 
Far  the  best  of  the  steeds  were  those  of  the  grandson  of  Pheres, 
Those  which  Eumelus  drove.    No  bird  surpassed  them  in  fleetness, 
Like  in  colour  and  age,  and  equal  in  height  by  the  level. 
Mares  were  they  both ;  by  Apollo  himself  in  Pieria  nurtured, 
Trained  up  to  whirl  the  thundering  car,  and  the  terrors  of  Ares. 
Bravest  among  the  chiefs  was  the  great  Telamonian  Aias 
Now  that  Achilles  was  absent  (for  he  was  superior  in  all  things, 
Faultless  in  all :  and  his  horses  were  better  than  those  of  Eumelus) ;  (7  70) 
He,  meanwhile,  in  his  ships  all  ready  for  sea,  lay  breathing 
Vengeance  against  Agamemnon  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  the  people, 
Atreus'  son;  while  his  troops  o'er  the  beach  were  scattered;  in  pastime 
Hurling  the  quoit,  or  the  jav'lin  darting,  or  aiming  the  arrow. 
Drooping  and  spiritless  now  each  courser  stood  by  his  chariot, 
Leisurely  feeding  on  lotus  and  parsley  leaves  from  the  marshes. 
Carefully  mantled,  the  cars  of  the  chiefs  stood  useless  and  idle. 
They  through  the  camp,  now  here,  now  there,  went  listlessly  wand'ring, 
Longing  to  join  in  fight  and  deploring  their  Prince's  inaclio?i. 

Now,  like  a  fiery  deluge,  devouring  the  earth  in  its  progress  (780) 
Swept  on  their  march  the  Greeks,  and  the  plain  resounding  beneath  them 
Roared,  as  in  answer  to  thundering  Zeus,  when  the  bolts  of  his  anger 
Smite  on  th'  accursed  soil  where  Typhosus  writhes  in  his  tormejit, 
Whelmed  and  entombed  (so  fame  declares)  beneath  Arime's  mountains. 
Thus  re-echoed  the  earth  to  their  measured  tread,  as  advancing  (785) 
Quickly  they  cleared  the  space  which  divided  the  camp  from  the  city.  [785] 

Iris,  swift  as  the  wind,  from  vEgis-bearing  Kronion 
Now  to  the  Trojans  was  sent,  and  dread  were  the  tidings  she  carried. 
Old  and  young  were  met  in  the  porch  of  the  palace  of  Priam 
Counsel  to  take.     Th'  assembly  was  formed  and   the  meeting  was 
open'd,  (790) 

When,  in  Polites'  shape,  and  his  voice  assuming,  among  them      [790] 
Iris  appeared,  and  at  once  as  the  son  of  Priam  addressed  them, 
Who  from  the  summit  of  old  iEsyetus'  tomb  was  observing 
Watchful,  each  move  of  the  Greeks,  a?id  alert,  to  announce  on  the  instant 
When  from  their  ships  they  advanced;  to  his  fleetness  trusting  for  safety. 
Such  was  the  form  she  took,  and  these  were  the  words  that  she  uttered.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  II. 


"  Old  and  revered  as  thou  art,  here  sitt'st  thou  fondly  debating 
Ev'n  as  if  all  were  peace ; — while  war  comes  thick ning  around  thee ! 
Many  a  muster  of  troops,  and  many  a  fight  have  I  witnessed : 
Yet  did  mine  eyes  ne'er  view  so  vast,  so  mighty  an  army.       (800) 
On  they  sweep,  like  leaves  in  the  woods,  like  sand  on  the  sea-beach  [800] 
Swarming  o'er  all  the  plain  and  making  straight  for  the  city. 
Hector  !  (for  thee  I  chiefly  advise)  let  this  be  thy  conduct : 
Many  and  brave  are  th'  auxiliar  troops  in  our  city  assembled, 
Various  the  tongues  they  speak  and  various  the  races  they  spring  from ; 
Each  to  its  own  accustomed  chief  let  these  be  entrusted  : 
Thou  shalt  thyself  our  native  pow'r  array  for  the  combat." 

Thus  she  spake  :  nor  did  Hector  mistake  the  celestial  accents ; 
But  the  assembly  dissolved.     All  rushed  to  arms  at  his  orders. 
Wide  were  the  gates  thrown  open;  and  forth  the  multitude  issued (8 10) 
Footmen  and  horse ;  mid  the  clash  of  their  arms  and  the  rattle  of  chariots. 

Far  on  the  plain  of  Troy,  but  straight  in  front  of  the  city, 
Rises  a  lofty  mound,  unfenc'd  and  open  on  all  sides, 
Known  as  the  hill  Bateia,  when  named  in  the  language  of  mortals, 
But  among  Gods  as  the  tomb  of  the  deftly-bounding  Myrinne. 
There  did  the  Trojans  with  all  their  allies  make  ready  for  battle. 

Hector,  lord  of  the  waving  plume,  commanded  the  Trojans, 
Son  of  old  Priam  their  king.     With  him  was  the  strength  of  the  army; 
Spearmen,  num'rous  and  brave;  each  skilled  in  the  use  of  his  weapons. 

Next  came  the  Dardan  force,  by  ^Eneas,  son  of  Anchises   (820) 
Led  to  the  fight.     Him  Venus  bore  to  his  father  Anchises,     [820] 
Woo'd  in  fair  Ida's  groves,  and  mingling  in  love  with  a  mortal. 
Joined  with  him  in  command,  the  two  brave  sons  of  Antenor 
Acamas  came  and  Archilochus,  chiefs  of  experience  and  conduct. 

Those  at  the  foot  of  Ida  who  dwelt,  on  the  plain  of  Zeleia 
Teeming  with  wealth,  and  who  drank  thy  turbid  water,  ^Esepus, 
Trojans  by  nation,  were  led  by  the  valiant  son  of  Lycaon, 
Pandarus,  gifted  by  Phoebus'  self  with  his  bow  and  his  quiver. 

Those  who  possessed  Adreste,  and  those  of  rural  Apsesus, 
Those  of  Piteia,  those  from  the  tow'ring  heights  of  Tereia,      (830) 
These  Adrastus,  and  he  of  the  corslet  of  linen,  Amphius,        [830] 
Sons  of  Percosian  Merops,  led.     Their  father  forbade  them, 


Book  II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  47 

Skilled  as  he  was  in  prophetic  lore,  to  go  forth  with  the  army, 
Tempting  their  fate  in  destructive  war.     But  vain  was  his  warning, 
Vain  his  command  :  for  the  darksome  paths  of  death  were  before  them. 

Those  who  around  Percote,  and  Praclius  dwelt,  and  Arisb6, 
Sestos,  and  those  of  the  close-confronting  shore  of  Abydos, 
Asius,  Hyrtacus'  son,  and  a  Prince  among  heroes,  commanded: 
Asius,  proud  of  his  large  and  fiery  steeds  from  Arisbe, 
Borne  by  their  might  in  his  car  from  the  flowery  banks  of  Sellei's.  (840) 

Next  by  Hippothous  led  were  the  fierce  Pelasgian  warriors,      [840] 
Those  of  the  tribes  who  Larissa's  fertile  region  inhabit. 
He  with  his  brother  Pylaeus  was  joined,  a  scion  of  Ares, 
Grandsons  of  Teutamus  both,  and  sons  of  Pelasgian  Lethus. 

Warriors  from  Thracia's  bounds,  by  the  swift-flowing  Hellespont 
bordered, 
Flocked  to  the  standard  of  Acamas  bold  and  the  hero  Piroiis. 

Under  Euphemus,  son  of  the  heav'n-descended  Troezenus, 
Grandson  of  Ceas,  marched  the  brave  Ciconian  spearmen. 

Armed  with  their  crooked  bows  the  Paeonians  came,  from  Amydon ; 

These   by  Pyraechmes  were   led,  from  afar,  from   the   wide-flowing 

Axius,  (850) 

Axius,  the  fairest  stream  which  the  Sun  beholds  in  his  circuit.  [850] 

Stern  Pylaemenes  led  the  Paphlagonian  warriors 
Who  from  Enitia  came,  where  mules  run  wild  in  the  pastures. 
Those  who  possessed  Cytorus,  and  those  whom  Sesamus  nurtured, 
Those  who  the  far-famed  towns  by  Parthenius  waters  inhabit, 
Cromna,  ^Egialus  too,  and  the  slopes  of  steep  Erythina. 

Hodius  the  Halizonians  led,  and  Epistrophus,  quitting 
Alybe's  distant  realm,  in  mines  of  silver  abounding. 

Chromis  the  Mysians  led,  with  Ennomus,  famed  as  an  augur: 
Yet    whom    no    bird    by    its    flight    could    warn     of    impending 
destruction,  (860) 

Destined,  alas !  to  fall  by  the  hand  of  mighty  Achilles,  [860] 

Rolled  to  the  sea  by  Scamander's  flood,  with  many  a  Trojan. 

Phorcis  and  godlike  Ascanius  led  the  Phrygian  warriors 
Eager  and  panting  for  fight,  from  far  Ascania's  frontier. 

Mesthles  and  Antiphus  led  the  brave  Maeonian  forces, 


48  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  II. 

Raised  where  Tmolus  rears  his  wide  o'ershadowing  summit; 
Both  were  Talsemenes'  sons,  by  a  nymph  of  the  Lake  Gygsea. 

Nastes  the  Carians  led,  of  a  rude  and  barbarous  language, 
Men  from  Miletus,  Phtheira  with  forests  crown'd,  and  the  margin 
Green    of  the    clear    Meander,    and    Mycale's    steep;   with  his  bro- 
ther [869]=(87o) 
Joined  in  command,  Amphimachus.    Both  were  sons  of  Nomion,  [871] 
Both  were  brave :  but  Amphimachus  decked  with  gold  like  a  maiden 
Rode  to  the  fight ;  and  his  glitt'ring  gauds  availed  not  to  save  him 
Or  to  avert  black  death:  by  the  hand  of  mighty  Achilles 
Slain  in  Scamander's  flood,  and  his  gold  was  the  spoil  of  the  victor. 

Last,  but  not  least  in  fame  were  Sarpedon  and  Glaucus  the  blameless. 
Leading  the  Lycian  bands  from  the  banks  of  eddying  Xanthus.    (877)

Argument. 


The  Greek  and  Trojan  armies  advance  to  battle.  Paris  challenges  the 
bravest  of  the  Greeks.  Menelaiis  comes  forwa?-d  to  oppose  him,  at  sight  of 
whom  Paris  retreats:  but  being  rebuked  by  Heel  or  for  his  cowardice^ 
declares  himself  ready  to  meet  him  in  single  combat.  The  terms  of  the 
combat  a?'e  agreed  on.  Priam  and  the  nobles  of  Troy  assenible  on  the 
walls  and  are  joined  by  Helen  at  the' summons  of  Iris.  At  Priam's 
request  she  points  oict  the  principal  Greek  leadej's  to  him.  Priam  being 
called  071  ratifies  the  terms  of  the  combat.  They  fight.  Paris  is  worsted; 
but  saved  by  Aphrodite,  who  carries  him  to  Troy,  where  he  is  joined  by 
Helen;  to  whom  the  Goddess  reconciles  him.  Paris  having  thus  quitted 
the  field,  Agamemnon  claims  the  fulfilment  of  the  terms  of  the  treaty.

IVTOW  was  each  host  arrayed  by  its  leader's  care  for  the  combat 

On  came  the  Trojans  like  birds  in  a  flock,  with  shouting  and 
clamour, 
As,  from  the  sky  loud  clanging,  the  cranes  set  forth  on  their  voyage, 
Leaving  behind  them  the  storms  and  the  ceaseless  rain  of  the  winter; 
Winging  their  noisy  flight  to  the  utmost  verge  of  the  ocean; 
Bearing  death  and  destructive  war  to  the  race  of  the  Pygmies 
When,  as  at  early  dawn,  like  a  cloud  they  descend  on  the  region. 

Breathing  united  force  the  Greeks  pressed  forward  in  silence, 
Firmly  resolved,  each  man,  to  stand  to  the  death  by  his  comrades. 

As  when  Notus  hath  breathed  his  mist  o'er  the  crest  of  the  moun- 
tains, (10) 
Held  by  the  shepherd  in  dread;  more  welcome  than  night  to  the  robber; 
Hardly  so  far  as  a  stone  may  be  flung  can  aught  be  distinguished; 
Thus  in  an  eddying  whirl  of  dust  both  armies  advancing 
Swept  o'er  the  plain;  and  at  speed  the  space  between  them  was  traversed. 

Now,  ere  they  closed  in  fight,  each  rapidly  nearing  the  other, 
Foremost  in  front  of  the  Trojans  outstept  from  the  ranks  Alexandres, 
Godlike  in  feature  and  form:  a  panther's  skin  o'er  his  shoulders 
Flung,  with  his  crooked  bow,  and  his  sword.  Two  lances  he  brandished 
Pointed  with  bronze,  and  loudly  defiant,  he  challenged  the  Grecians, 
Vaunting  himself  a  match  for  the  best  and  bravest  among  them.     (20) 
Him  no  sooner  beheld  the  indignant  chief  Menelaiis 
Strutting  in  insolent  guise  thus  boldly  in  front  of  the  armies, 
Than,  as  a  hungry  lion  o'er  some  rich  quarry  rejoices, 
Some  great  stag  with  branching  horns,  or  goat  of  the  mountain, 


5 2  THE  ILIAD  OE  HOMER.  [Book  III. 

When  with  a  spring  he  seizes,  and  tears  it  down,  and  devours  it ; 
Reckless  of  dogs  fierce  baying  around  or  the  shouts  of\h&lt;z  hunters: 
So  Menelaiis  rejoiced,  that  form  divine  and  those  features 
When  with  his  eyes  he  beheld,  most  hateful.    Then  of  his  vengeance 
Certain  at  length,  he  leaped  to  the  ground  full-armed  from  his  chariot. 
Him  when  now  Alexander  beheld  advancing  to  meet  him,         (30) 
Struck  to  the  heart  with  terror  and  shame,  at  once  he  retreated, 
Plunging  amid  the  host  of  his  friends  and  shunning  destruction. 
As  when  a  traveller,  deep  in  the  tangled  brake  of  a  mountain 
Comes  unawares  on  a  snake;  with  trembling  knees  and  in  horror 
Back  he  recoils  with  a  start,  and  a  paleness  spreads  o'er  his  features. 
Thus  shrank  back  Alexander  among  the  magnanimous  Trojans, 
Dreading  the  sight  of  the  man  he  had  injured,  fell  Menelaiis. 

This  when  Hector  beheld,  with  reproachful  words  he  assailed  him : 
11  Paris  !  too  fatally  fair  !  seducer  of  women  !  deceiver  ! 
Would  thou  hadst  never  been  born,  or  died  ere  thine  ill-omened  muptials.  (40) 
That  would  I  rather  have  seen :  and  that  for  thyself  had  been  better, 
Than  to  stand  forth,  the  scandal  and  scorn  of  the  hosts  who  behold  thee. 
Well  may  the  long-hair'd  Greeks  break  forth  in  these  shouts  ^/"derision, 
Looking  for  martial  deeds  from  so  gay,  so  handsome  a  hero : 
Looking  in  vain !  for  strength  thou  hast  none,  nor  spirit  within  thee. 
How  could'st  thou  dare,  being  such  as  thou  art,  to  set  forth  on  thy  voyage 
(Manning  thy  sea-going  ships  with  the  choicest  youth  of  our  city), 
Prank  it  in  foreign  courts;  and  elope  with  the  fairest  of  women, 
Widow  and  consort  of  martial  chiefs  in  the  Apian  country; 
Making  thyself  a  curse  to  thy  father,  thy  city,  and  nation;         (50) 
Triumph  and  joy  to  thy  foes;  to  thyself  a  reproach  and  abasement? 
Had'st  thou  but  dared  one  moment  to  stand  and  confront  Menelaiis, 
Soon  thou  hadst  learned  what  manner  of  man  should  be  Helena's  husband ! 
Then  would  thy  harp  nought  avail,  nor  the  gifts  of  bright  Aphrodite, 
Nought  thy  fair  ringlets  rolled  in  the  dust,  nor  the  grace  ofxhy  figure! 
Were  but  the  Trojans  true  to  themselves,  ere  this  we  had  seen  thee 
Wrapped  in  thy  last  dark  mantle  of  stone  for  the  woes  thou  hast  wrought 
them." 

Thus  then  replied  Alexander  the  Godlike  in  form  and  in  feature : 
4 'Just,  O  Hector,  indeed,  though  severe,  are  the  words  thou  hast  spoken.

Firm  is  ever  thine  heart  and  unworn,  like  the  axe  which  the  ship- 
wright (60) 
Drives  through  the  knotted  oak  when  he  shapes  some  beam  for  his 

vessel; 
True  to  his  hand,  and  seconding  well  the  strength  that  impels  it : 
Such  is  the  firm  and  constant  mind  which  dwells  in  thy  bosom. 
Yet  undervalue  thou  not  the  gifts  of  bright  Aphrodite. 
Beauty  and  valour  alike  as  the  Gods'  rich  gifts  should  be  honoured, 
Granted  to  whom  they  love:  not  yielded  to  prayer  or  to  longing. 
Yet  woulgls't  thou  have  me  advance,  and  stand  committed  to  combat? 
Halt  thy  troops  and  let  all,  both  Greeks  and  Trojans,  be  seated. 
Place  me  at  once  in  the  midst,  confronted  with  grim  Menelaus. 
Here  on  the  spot  will  we  fight  it  out,  for  the  dame  and  the  treasure.  (70) 
He  who  shall  prove  the  better  man  and  shall  conquer  the  other, 
His  be  the  spoil,  and  Helen  the  fair,  and  home  let  him  bear  them. 
Then  be  a  treaty  by  oath  confirmed.  So  shall  ye,  O  ye  Trojans, 
Dwell  on  your  fertile  fields  in  peace ;  and  the  Greeks  shall  revisit 
Argos  famed  for  its  steeds,  and  Achaia  the  land  of  the  lovely." 

Thus  he  spake.    But  Heclor  rejoiced  when  he  heard  the  proposal. 
Stepping  in  front  of  his  troops  he  repressed  their  ranks,  with  his  jav'lin 
Levelled  and  held  by  the  middle  athwart,  and  made  them  be  seated. 
Instantly  many  a  bow  was  drawn  by  the  long-hair'd  Achaians, 
Many  a  spear  was  aimed,  and  stones  came  flying  around  him,        (80) 
But  Agamemnon  the  king  from  afar  loud  shouted  his  orders  : 

"Hold!  on  your  lives.    Not  a  spear  be  hurled,  ye  sons  of  Achaia! 
Crest-waving  Heclor  stands  forth,  having  somewhat  to  say.  Let  us  hear 
him." 
Thus  he  spake:  and  the  Greeks  restrained  their  assault  and  were 
silent. 
Hector  then,  advancing  between  both  armies,  addressed  them  : 
"Listen!  ye  Trojans  all,  and  ye  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia, 
What  Alexander,  with  whom  began  this  quarrel,  proposes. 
Greeks  and  Trojans  alike  lay  down  your  glittering  weapons 
Here  on  the  grassy  plain  and  await  the  issue  in  silence; 
While,  in  the  sight  of  all,  himself  and  brave  Menelaus  (90) 

Singly  and  hand  to  hand  shall  fight  for  the  dame  and  the  treasure.

Then  be  a  treaty  by  oath  confirmed,  and  let  peace  be  between  us." 

Thus  he  spake :  and  all  maintained  a  reverent  silence 
Till  Menelaiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  responded  : 
"Hear  me  too:  for  'tis  I  who  am  injuredjmine  is  the  suff'ring. 
Fain  would  I  see  this  strife  composed,  and  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans

In  this  quarrel  of  mine,  for  the  outrage  of  mad  Alexandros.  (too)

So  that  the  truce  of  Jove  by  no  reckless  hand  may  be  broken. 
Ever  the  spirit  of  younger  men  is  fickle  and  headstrmg; 
Only  from  severed  age  which  li?iks  the  past  with  the  future 
Looking  before  and  after,  can  justice  and  faith  be  expected." 
Thus  he  spake.      Both  Greeks  and  Trojans   rejoiced   when 
hear^l  him, 

^Hoping  at  length  for  peace  and  respite  from  war  and  its  labours. 
Reining  back  his  steeds  to  the  foremost  ranks  of  the  footmen 
Each  brave  chief  horn  his  chariot  sprang,  and  each -with  his  soldiers 
Doffed  their  resplendent  arms  and  laid  them  closely  in  order, 
Small  being  the  space  arpund.     Then  Hector  despatched  to  the  city 
Heralds  in  haste  to  provide  two  lambs,  and  Priain  to  summon. 
King  Agamemnon  the  while  Talthybius  sent  to  the  vessels, 
Bidding  him  there  select  an  unblemished  lamb  for  the  offring. 
*  Forth  he  sped,  and  with  small  delay  was  his  errand  accomplished.  (120)

Horse-taming   Trojans   and  bronze-mailed   Greeks  who   had   fought 

in  her  quarrel, 
All  thsy  had  dared,  and  all  endured  from  the  ruler  of  battles. 
Standing  beside  her,  thus  then  spake  the  swift-footed  Iris : 

"Haste,  dear  Lady!  with  me,  and  behold  a  sight  will  surprisethee;  (130) 
Horse-taming  Trojans  and  bronze-mailed  Greeks  desisting  from  conflict. 
They,  who  so  oft  in  the  field  have  closed  in  mutual  slaughter, 
(Cause  oifull  ma?iy  a  tear)  and  rejoiced  in  the  horrors  of  battle, 
Now  sit  peaceful  and  silent,  each  man  on  his  buckler  reclining. 
Plunged  are  their  spears  in  the  ground,  and  the  clai7iour  of  war  is 

•suspended, 
While  on  the  space  between,  Alexander  and  fierce  Menelaiis 
Wield  their  long  spears  in  fight;  and  thyself,  the  prize  they  contend  for, 
Henceforth  art  doomed  to  be  called  the  wife  of  him  who  shall  conquer." 

Thus  spake  the  Goddess;  and  sweet,  sad  longings  inspired  in  her 
bosom. 
Country — parents — her  former  Lord,  all  rushed  on  her  fancy.       (140) 
Dropping  a  tender  tear  she  arose,  and  forth  from  her  chamber 
Hasted,  her  beauteous  form  in  a  snow-white  mantle  involving, 
Not  unattended ;  for  two  fair  handmaids  close  on  her  footsteps 
^Ethra,  Pittheus'  daughter,  and  large-eyed  Clymen6  followed. 
Soon  •  to  the  Scaean  gate  they  came,  where  already  assembled 
Priam  she  found,  and  the  sages  of  Troy  around  him ;  Thymcetes, 
.Panthoiis,  Clytius,  Lampus,  and,  offspring  of  Mars,  Hicetaon, 
Near  him  Ucalegon  sate  and  Antenor,  prudent  in  council, 
Elders  both  of  the  people  :  all  loved  by  Priain  and  trusted: 
Warworn  chiefs  who  no  longer  fought — yet  eloquent  speakers,      (150) 
Garrulous:  like  the  cicadas  that  people  th©  pine  in  the  forest, 
Chirping  their  shrill  and  musical  song  as  they  bask  in  the  sunbeam; 
Such  were  the  Trojan  chiefs  who  sate  looking  forth  from  the  rampart. 
These,  when  Helena  now  they  beheld,  on  the  rampart  approaching, 
Thus  in  an  under-tone  exchanged  their  thoughts  with  each  other : 

"Who  can  wonder  or  blame  that  the  bright-armed  Greeks  and  the 
Trojans 
Year  after  year  for  so  glorious  a  woman  have  fought  and  have  suffered? 
Lo  I  whe?-e  she  comes,  like  a  Goddess  immortal  in  face  and  in  person ! 


56  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  III. 

Albeit,  fair  as  she  is,  Heav'n  grant  her  speedy  departure! 

So  shall  destruclion  andwoe  be  spared  to  ourselves  and  our  children."  (160) 

Thus  they  whispered;  but  Priam,  to  Helena  calling,  addressed  her: 
"Come,  dear  child!  advance  to  the  front  and  seat  thee  beside  me, 
Where  thou  may'st  see  thy  former  spouse,  thy  friends  and  relations. 
(Thee  by  no  means  I  blame.     To  thegpods  alone  I  attribute 
All  the  destructive  war  which  the  Greeks  are  waging  against  me. ) 
Come  then:  name  me  that  portly  chief  so  distinguished  among  them, 
Him  thou  see'st  in  the  front;  that  tall  and  vigorous  leader. 
Ne'er  did  mine  eyes  behold  so  majestic  a  man,  or  so  goodly. 
Others  indeed  are  there  who  in  strength  and  stature  surpass  him : 
That  man  however  excels  them  all,  for  he  moves  like  a  sov'reign."     (170) 

Helena  then  these  words  returned,  the  divine  among  women: 
"Shrinking  with  rev'rence  and  fear,  dear  Father-in-law,  I  approach  thee. 
Would  I  had  rather  the  bitterest  death  preferred  to  forsaking 
Friends,  and  my  wedded  lord,  and  my  darling  child,  and  the  playmates 
Dear  of  my  innocent  youth,  to  follow  thy  son  o'er  the  ocean. 
So  was  it  not  to  be !  and  in  grief  and  in  tears  I  bewail  it. 
Yet  what  thou  seek'st  to  know,  as  in  duty  bound  will  I  tell  thee. 
There  thou  behold' st  Atreides,  the  wide  ruling  King  Agamemnon, 
Statesman  a?id  warrior;  good  as  a  prince  and  brave  as  a  captain. 
Once  (it  seems  like  a  dream)  he  called  me  shameless his  Sister." 

Helena  ceased,  and  admiringly  thus  old  Priam  responded:  (181) 
"Happy  Atreides!     Blest  in  thy  birth,  thrice  blest  in  thy  fortunes, 
Blest  in  the  subject  Greeks  who  in  such  vast  numbers  obey  thee! 
Once  to  the  Phrygian  land  I  came — the  land  of  the  vineyard. 
There  I  beheld  that  countless  host  of  the  Phrygian  horsemen 
Swift  as  the  wind;  the  troops  of  godlike  Mygdon  and  Otreus 
Camped  on  Sangarius'  banks :  and  mine  were  numbered  among  them, 
Join'd  in  friendly  alliance;  what  time  came  down  to  oppose  us, 
Rivals  in  courage  of  men,  the  fierce  Amazonian  squadrons. 
Yet  far  fewer  were  these  than  the  bright-eyed  sons  of  Achaia."      (190) 

After  a  pause  the  king  resumed,  beholding  Odysseus: 
"Tell  me  I  pray  thee  now,  dear  child,  the  name  of  the  warrior 
There  whom  I  see;  in  stature  less  than  tall  Agamemnon; 
Broader  however  in  shoulders,  and  chest     This  well  I  distinguish 


Book  III.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  S7 

Since  he  hath  doffed  his  armour,  and  there  on  the  ground  it  is  scattered. 
Stately  and  slow  meanwhile,  like  a  ram,  through  his  soldiers  he  passes. 
Aptly,  methinks  indeed,  to  a  thick-fleeced  ram  I  compare  him 
Ranging  through  some  great  flock  of  snow-white  sheep  in  the  pastures." 

Helena  thus,  from  Zeus  descended,  replied  to  his  question: 
"That  is  the  wise  Laertes'  son,  much-scheming  Odysseus,  (200) 

Nurtured  in  Ithaca's  realm — rough  nurse  for  so  shrewd  a  cofitriver, 
Practised  in  every  wile,  and  prudent  in  every  counsel." 

Sage  Antenor  took  up  the  word,  and  thus  he  addressed  her: 
"Lady!  thy  word  is  truth  itself.     Right  well  I  re7?ieniber 
When  in  thine  own  behalf,  by  Greece  commissioned,  Odysseus 
Came  to  propose  some  terms  to  Troy  with  brave  Menelaiis; 
How  to  my  lot  it  fell  to  receive  them  both  in  my  palace. 
Thus  did  I  clearly  discern  the  genius  of  each,  and  his  temper. 
When  with  th'  assembled  Trojans  they  came,  together,  in  council, 
Standing  indeed,  Menelaiis  by  head  and  shoulders  o'ertopped  him,  (210) 
Sitting  however,  Odysseus  appeared  more  grave  and  majestic. 
When  in  the  presence  of  all  they  unfolded  the  web  of  their  purpose, 
Arguing  the  matter  in  hand, — Menelaiis  was  eager  and  hurried, 
Brief,  and  sparing  of  words,  yet  clear;  and  direct  to  his  object 
All  that  he  said;  not  loquacious,  nor  wild  in  his  talk,  though  the  younger. 
But  when  Odysseus  rose,  that  man  of  many  devices, 
Fixing  his  down-cast  eyes  on  the  ground  he  stood :  nor  his  sceptre 
Swayed,  either  this  way  or  that  like  a  practised  speaker;  but  held  it 
Motionless,  ev'n  as  a  man  unskilled  in  the  arts  of  persuasion. 
One  would  declare  him  mute  with  passion  or  wanting  in  judgement.  (220) 
But  when  he  spoke,  when  his  powerful  voice  went  forth  from  his  bosom, 
Issuing  in  words  which  fell  like  flakes  of  snow  in  the  winter, 
Surely  no  mortal  man  might  hope  to  compete  with  Odysseus. 
Lost  in  wonder  we  sate:  but  not,  as  before,  at  his  manner." 

Aias  beholding,  thus,  for  the  third  time  questioned  the  monarch : 
"Name  me,  I  pray  thee,  now,  that  mighty  and  vigorous  chieftain, 
Tow'ring  o'er  all  the  Greeks  by  his  head  and  th'  expanse  ofhis  shoulders." 

Thus  did  the  long-robed  Helen  reply,  the  divine  among  women : 
"That  is  the  mighty  Aias,  the  bulwark  and  strength  of  Achaia. 
There,  on  the  other  side,  Idomeneus  stands  with  his  Cretans,       (230) 


58  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  III. 

Like  to  a  God;  and  around  him  the  chieftains  of  Crete  are  collected. 
Often  to  brave  Menelaiis  an  honoured  guest,  in  our  palace 
Kindly  received  and  welcomed,  he  came,  and  sojourned  among  us. 
Others,  and  many  there  are  of  the  keen-eyed  eyed  sons  of  Achaia 
Whom  I  could  name  by  name ;  for  well  I  remember  their  features. 
Two,  however,  in  vain  I  seek,  two  princely  commanders, 
Both  my  own  brothers,  both  from  my  own  dear  mother  descended ; 
Castor  the  horseman  bold ;  Polydeuces  unmatched  with  the  caestus. 
Have  they,  perchance  not  followed  their  friends  from  fair  Lacedaemon? 
Or  if  indeed  with  the  rest  they  have  ploughed  the   wave   in   their 
vessels  (240) 

Hold  they  aloof  from  the  host,  and  refuse  to  join  in  the  contest, 
Dreading  the  stain  and  reproach  of  a  cause  so  foul  as  their  sister's?" 

Thus  she  spake.     But  both  th' all-fostering  earth  in  her  bosom 
Long  had  received,  in  the  land  of  their  birth,  their  lov'd  Lacedaemon. 

Now  were  the  Heralds  arrived  who  the  offerings  bore  through  the  city, 
Both  the  lambs,  and  generous  wine,  earth's  genial  produce, 
Sealed  up  in  goatskin  flasks  :  and  a  bowl  the  herald  Idasus 
Bore,  of  resplendent  silver,  and  goblets  of  gold,  for  libation. 
Taking  his  station  beside  the  king,  this  summons  he  uttered: 
'Reverend  son  of  Laomedon!  rise.    The  chieftains  expecl.  thee,  (250) 
Horse-taming  Trojans  and  bronze-mail'd  Greeks.  They  attend  thy  arrival 
There  in  the  field  below,  to  confirm  with  an  oath  their  agreement. 
Then  shall  thy  son  Alexander  and  Mars-beloved  Menelaiis 
Meet  with  protended  spears,  and  fight  for  the  dame  and  the  treasure. 
He  who  may  conquer  shall  take  them  both,  and  in  peace  shall  possess 

them. 
We,  thenceforth,  who  the  compact  accept  and  with  oaths  have  confirmed 

it, 
Here  in  our  fertile  Troia  will  dwell;  while  they  shall  revisit 
Argos  famed  for  its  steeds,  and  Achaia  the  land  of  the  lovely." 

Thus  Idseus ;  and  shudd'ring,  the  summons  he  heard,  and  the  horses 
Straightway  bade  yoke  to  the  car.    This  soon  th'  attendants  accomplish- 
ed. (260) 
Mounting  at  once,  the  reins  he  seized.     Antenor  beside  him 
Stood  in  the  beauteous  chariot;  and  forth  they  sped,  and  the  horses 


Book  III.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  59 

Flew  through  the  Scaean  gate  to  the  plain  where  the  chiefs  were  assembled, 
Trojans  and  Greeks.  When  now  they  were  come  to  the  place  of  assembly, 
Down  from  the  chariot  fair  on  the  fruitful  earth  they  alighted, 
And  to  the  midst  advanced,  both  hosts  making  way  to  receive  them. 
Straightway  arose  from  his  seat  the  king  of  men  Agamemnon, 
Up  rose  Odysseus  the  wise.     And  now  vth'   illustrious  heralds 
Brought  together  the  mutual  pledges,  and  duly  commingled 
Wine  in  the  bowl.     Then  water  they  poured  on  the  hands  of  the 

sov'reigns ;  (27°) 

Next  Agamemnon   drew  with  his  hands   a  sharp-edged  poniard 
Which  from  the  mighty  sheath  of  his  sword  hung  ever  suspended, 
Cropping  with  this  their  wool  from  the  heads  of  the  lambs  :  and  the 

heralds 
Handed  it  round,  a  portion  to  each  of  the  Princes  assembled. 
Loud  then  prayed  Agamemnon,  his  hands  uplifted  to   Heaven  : 
"Father  Zeus!  most  great,  most  glorious,  ruling  from  Ida; 
Thou,  too,  all-seeing  Sun !  who  hear'st  our  words  and  rememVrest; 
Fountains  and  Streams  !  Thou  Earth !  and  ye  Pow'rs  beneath  it,  who 

punish 
Perjur'd  mortals  beyond  the  grave !     I   call  you  to  witness. 
Hear  what   we   swear,   and  sanction  the  league  we  make   in   your 

presence.  (280) 

Should  it  befal  that  in  fight  Alexandros  slay  Menelaiis, 
Helena  then  be  his  own.     We  yield  all  claim  to  the  treasure. 
Forthwith  then  in  our  sea-going  ships  we  take  our  departure. 
But  should  the  yellow-hair'd  chief  Menelaiis  slay  Alexandros, 
Helena  then  and  the  treasure  shall  Troy  restore  to  the  Grecians; 
Adding  moreover  a  fine,  whate'er  shall  be  just  and  sufficient. 
This  shall  remain  to  the  Greeks,  nor  shall  after  ages  dispute  it. 
This  should  Priam  and  Priam's  sons  refuse,  or  evade  it, 
(In  fair  fight  Alexander  being  slain)  the  war  shall  continue, 
I  myself  will  remain  with  my  troops,  and  fight  for  the  ransom;     (290) 
Fight  to  the  end,  and  till  all  be  paid,  and  the  debt  be  acquitted." 
Ending,  with  cruel  blade  the  throats  of  the  lambs  he  divided, 
Down  on  the  earth  their  bodies  he  flung,  all  bleeding  and  panting 
In  the  last  gasp  of  life,  for  their  strength  had  ebbed  from  the  death  wound. 


60  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  III. 

Into  the  cups  from  the  bowl  the  Avine  they  poured,  and  receiving 
Drank,  and  devoutly  prayed,  each  Pow'r  immortal  invoking. 
Then  might  be  heard  such  words  as  these  from  Greek  and  from  Trojan : 
''Hear  us!  Zeus  most  great,  most  glorious,  and  all  ye  Immortals. 
He  who  shall  dare  this  treaty  to  break,  and  the  oaths  ye  have  witnessed, 
Oh !  may  his  blood  on  the  ground  be  spilled,  like  yonder  libations,  (300) 
His  and  his  children's  too,  and  his  wife  to  a  stranger  be  captive." 
Thus  they  prayed — (but  Zeus  refused  to  hear  their  petitions). 
Then  Dardanian  Priam  addressed  the  leaders  assembled: 
"Hear  me  ye  Trojans  all,  and  ye  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia! 
Home  will  I  now  return  to  my  wind-swept  Ilian  fortress. 
How  can  mine  eyes  endure  this  dreadful  struggle  to  witness 
Where  my  dear  son  shall  contend  for  life  with  fierce  Menelaiis? 
Known  unto  Zeus  and  th'  immortal  Gods  alone  is  the  issue, 
Which  of  the  two  shall  survive,  and  which  must  fall  in  the  conflict." 

Thus  spake  the  Godlike  man,  and  laid  the  lambs  on  his  chariot,  (310) 
Mounted,  the  guiding  reins  he  grasped.     Antenor  beside  him 
Stood  in  the  beauteous  car.     And  sadly  and  slow  to  the  city 
Back  they  returned,  deep  musing  on  what  might  chance  in  the  combat. 

Hector  the  son  of  Priam  now,  with  the  noble  Odysseus 
Carefully  measured  the  ground  for  the  fight.     This  done,  in  a  helmet 
Glitfri?ig  with  burnished  brass  they  cast  two  lots  to  determine 
Which  of  the  heroes  twain  should  first  deliver  his  jav'lin. 
Then  might  words  like  these  have  been  heard  from  Greeks  and  from 

Trojans, 
Lifting  their  hands  in  prayer,  and  the  Gods  immortal  invoking : 
"Father  Zeus!  most  great,  most  glorious,  ruling  from  Ida,       (320) 
O !  may  the  man  who  has  caused  these  woes  to  ourselves  and  our  nations 
Slain  and  cut  off,  sink  down  to  the  darksome  mansions  of  Hades. 
So  may  we  part  as  friends,  and  peace  be  for  ever  between  us." 

Thus  they  prayed;  but  Hector,  averting  his  eyes,  in  the  helmet 
Tossed  up  the  lots,  and  the  lot  of  Paris  leaped  forth  on  the  instant. 
Down  sate  the  troops,  each  man  in  his  rank  and  place,  and  beside  them 
Chariot  and  horse  stood  arrayed  and  the  ground  gleamed  bright  with 

their  armour. 
Then  Alexander  divine,  the  fair-hair  d  Helena's  husband, 


Book  III.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  61 

Sprang  to  his  feet  where  he  sate,  and  donned  his  beauteous  armour. 
First  to  his  well-turned  legs  his  glittering  greaves  he  adjusted        (330) 
Burnished  and  richly  wrought,  and  clasped  with  buckles  of  silver; 
Next  (for  it  fitted  him  well)  he  braced  round  his  bosom  a  corslet 
Worn  by  his  brother  Lycaon;  and  slung  by  a  belt  o'er  his  shoulder 
Pendent,  his  sword  of  bronze,  in  a  sheath  all  studded  with  silver; 
Slung,  too,  ready  for  use,  his  broad  and  ponderous  buckler; 
Placed  on  his  stately  head  his  helmet  of  proof,  with  a  horsetail 
Crested ;  and  dreadfully  nodded  the  waving  plume  to  his  movements, 
As  with  familiar  grasp  he  poised  his  quivering  jav'lin. 
Soon  too,  bold  Menelaus  in  arms  stood  ready  for  combat. 
Now  when  they  both  were  armed,  each  forth  from  the  ranks  of  his 

comrades  (34°) 

Strode  with  undaunted  step,  and  advanced  in  front  of  the  armies. 
Fiercely  glaring  they  strode,  while  breathless  suspense  and  amazement 
Seized  on  the  gazing  hosts,  both  Greeks  and  Trojans  around  them. 
Near,  and  nearer  they  drew  in  the  measured  list,  and  their  lances 
Wrathfully  shook,  each  bending  an  angry  scowl  on  the  other. 
Then  Alexandros  first  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin 
Hurled :  and  full  on  the  midst  of  the  smooth  round  shield  of  Atreides 
Harmless  it  rang,  nor  pierced  the  bronze;  but  back  from  the  buckler, 
Blunted  and  bent,  recoiled.     Then  next  in  turn,  Menelaus 
Rose   as  in  act.  to  throw — but  first  preferred  his  petition:       (350) 
"Zeus  supreme!  O,  grant  me  revenge  on  the  man  who  has  wronged 

me; 
Grant  me  to  slay  with  my  hands  this  impious  wretch  Alexandros. 
So  shall  each  future  guest  take  warning,  and  tremble  to  render 
Wrongs  in  return  for  friendly  deeds,  and  betrayal  for  welcome." 
Thus  he  prayed  and  dismissed  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin: 
Full  on  the  smooth  round  shield  of  the  son  of  Priam  it  lighted; 
Thoro'  the  shining  bronze  it  forc'd  its  impetuous  passage, 
Then  through  the  corslet  rich  its  course  pursued,  and  descending 
Glanced  by  his  flank  aside;  and  his  vest  was  torn  by  the  weapon. 
Swerving,  however,  with  dextrous  skill,  black  death  he  eluded.     (360) 
Straightway  Atreides   drew  forth  his   sword  all  studded  with  silver, 
Raised  it  aloft  and  dealt  on  his  crest  a  stroke:  but  the  falchion 


62  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  III. 

Splintered,  and  crackling,  flew  from  his  hand  in  shivers  around  him. 
Casting  on  heav'n  an  upbraiding  glance,  then  groaned  he  in  anger: 
"Zeus !   Thou  /latest  me  now.     No  god  more  bitterly  thwarts  me ! 
Else,  ev'n  now  had  I  slain  this  wretch,  and  his  villainies  punished. 
See  how  my  faithless  sword  hath  snapped  in  my  grasp,  and  my  jav'lin 
Flown  from  my  hand  in  vain,  nor  drunk  the  blood  of  my  foeman." 
Thus  exclaiming,  he  rushed  on  his  foe,  and  the  crest  of  his  helmet 
Seizing,   he  grappled  him  close   and    dragged    to  the   ranks  of  the 

Grecians,  (37°) 

Struggling,  and  well-nigh  choked  by  the  broidered  thong  of  the  helmet 
Tightened  beneath  his  chin  in  the  deadly  grasp  of  Atreides. 
Then  had  he  dragged  him   down,   immortal  glory  securing, 
Had  not  bright  Aphrodite  perceived  the  distress  of  her  fav'rite, 
Daughter  of  Zeus.     And  she  burst  that  strong  bull-hide  and  released 

him. 
Nought  but  the  empty  casque  remained  in  the  hand  of  the  victor. 
This  with  a  scornful  toss  to  the  Greeks  he  whirled,  and  his  comrades 
Raised  it  from  where  it  fell,   and  preserved  the  glittering  trophy. 
Then  rushed  on  Menelalis  again,   all  eager  to  slay  him 
With  his  recovered  spear.     But  once  more  bright  Aphrodite      (380) 
Came  to  his  aid,  and  in  mist  involved,  with  ease  she  conveyed  him 
(Such  was  her  pow'r)  to  his  chamber  fair,  perfumed  and  luxurious. 
Helena  then  she  sought,   to  call  her  away :  and  she  found  her 
There  on  the  rampart  high,  by  the  dames  of  Troia  surrounded. 
Lightly  approaching  she  plucked  her  fragrant  robe,  and  addressed  her, 
(Taking  the  form  of  an  ancient  crone  much  lov'd  by  her  mistress ; 
One  who  in  days  long  since  gone  by,  in  fair  Lacedsemon 
Combed  out  the  fleecy  wool,  and  plied  in  her  chamber  the  distaff,) 
Like  in  feature  and  voice,  thus  spake  divine  Aphrodite : 
"  Come  with  me  home !  Alexandros  calls,  and  impatient  awaits  thee 
There,  in  thy  chamber  fair,  on  thy  polished  couch,  he  reposes     (391) 
Glowing  with  youthful  charms,  and  in  splendid  attire.    Thou  would' st 

deem  him 
Not  from  a  desperate  fight  returned ;  but  gaily  preparing 
Either  to  dance,  or  withdrawn  for  a  while  from  the  whirl  of  the  dancers." 
Thus  she  spake;  and  a  tumult  wild  within  Helena's  bosom 


Book  III.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  63 

Rose.,  as  th'  allbeauteous  neck  and  the  lovely  breast  of  the  Goddess 
How  she  perceived,  and  her  flashing  eyes :  and  a  thrill  of  amazement, 
Mingled   with    dread,    through  her   frame  ran  swifts  while  thus  she 

addressed  her : 
"Dreadful  one!  why  dost  thou  practise  on  me  thine  arts  of  seduction? 
Am  I  then  next  to  be  hurried  to  some  fres/i  scene  of  delusion,        (400) 
Fair  Maeonian  town,  or  populous  Phrygian  city, 
Where  some  fav;rite  of  thine  perchance  may  sigh  for  a  Hele?i  ? 
Or  dost  thou  grudge  to  let  Menelaiis  carry  me  homeward, 
(Hateful  albeit  in  his  eyes  I  seem),  as  the  prize  of  his  conquest? 
Is  it  for  that  thou  comest  and  seek'st  once  more  to  beguile  me? 
Go  thou  to  Paris  and  sit  by  his  side,  renouncing  thy  godhead. 
Teach  thy  own  feet  to  forget  those  paths  that  lead  to  Olympus. 
Watch  him,  and  tend  him;  rejoice  with  his  joy  and  mourn  with  his  sorrow. 
So  perchance  shall  he  make  thee  his  wife : — peradventure  his  handmaid ! 
Never  again  will  I  see  him,  for  that  were  shame  and  confusion!    (41c) 
Never  again  will  I  honour  his  couch  !     Each  woman  of  Troia 
Thenceforth  would  hold  me  in  scorn,  and  my  days  were  for  ever  em- 
bittered." 
Then   divine  Aphrodite,  incensed,  this  answer  returned  her : 
"Insolent!    Dread  to  provoke  me  more:  lest  in  wrath  I  forsake  thee, 
Singling  thee  out  for  a  hate  more  marked  than  the  love  I  have  shewn  thee; 
Lest  in  one  general  wreck  I  involve  both  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans 
Battling  with  tenfold  rage ;  and  a  horrible  fate  be  thy  portion." 

Thus  she  spake :  and  the  daughter  of  Zeus,  fair  Helena  trembled. 
Silent,  her  white  transparent  robe  close  gath'ring  around  her, 
Led  by  the  goddess,  unmissed  by  the  Troian  dames,  she  departed.  (420) 
When  to  the  princely  palace  they  came  where  dwelt  Alexandros, 
Both  her  attendants  resumed  their  accustomed  tasks  in  the  household. 
She,  the  divinely  fair,  to  his  lofty  chamber  ascended, 
Where  Aphrodite,  Goddess  of  smiles,  advancing  before  her 
Placed  in  his  presence  a  stately  seat,  and  beckoned  her  to  it. 
Seated,  in  pride,  the  daughter  of  iEgis-b earing  Kronion, 
Deigned  not  a  look;  but  averting  her  face  thus  taunted  her  husband: 
"So!   thou  art  come  from  the  wars!   Oh!  would  that  there  thou 
hadst  perished, 


64  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  III. 

Slain  by  the  conquering  sword  of  the  hero  who  once  was  my  husband. 
Where  is  thy  empty  vaunt  that  the  great,  the  brave  Menelaus  (430) 
Thou,  with  thy  sword,  thy  spear,  and  thy  strength,  would'st  surpass  in 

the  combat? 
Go  then !  attempt  it  again  :  and  challenge  that  fierce  Menelaus 
Once  more  to  fight  it  out.     But  hear  my  word ;  for  I  warn  thee, 
Keep  on  the  prudent  side ;  nor  that  fair-hair'd  chief  Menelaus 
Tempt  to  the  fight  unadvised,  nor  his  force  confront;  shouldst  thou  dare  it, 
Quickly  his  spear's  broad  blade  in  thy  streaming  blood  shall  be  purpled." 

Then  Alexander  replied,  and  in  words  like  these  he  addressed  her: 
"Cease,  most  lovely  of  women,  to  sting  my  soul  with  reproaches. 
What  though  for  once,  by  Athene's  aid  Menelaus  have  conquered: 
My  turn  will  one  day  come — for  I  too  have  Gods  who  befriend  me.  (440) 
Still  let  us  love,  whatever  befal,  and  set  fate  at  defiance. 
Why  shouldst  thou  change,  and  why  upbraid?     My  love  is  unaltered. 
Am  I  not  still  thy  Paris  who  first  from  fair  Lacedaemon 
Bore  thee  in  triu?nph  away?     Or  e'er  have  I  ceased  to  adore  thee? 
Not  when  in  Cranae's  isle  thou  gav'st  consent  to  our  unioti 
Lov'd  I  thee  half  so  well.     And  surely  thou  dost  not  abhor  me!" 
Thus  he  spake;  and  Helen  repented  her  words  and  forgave  him. 
Such  was  the  power  of  Love,  and  such  was  her  joy  for  his  safety. 

But  Menelaus  like  some  wild  beast  deprived  of  his  viclim 
Raged  round  the  field,  and  sought  in  vain  through  the  crowd  Alexan- 
dros.  (45°) 

Readily  all  the  Trojans  and  all  their  auxiliar  squadrons 
Opened  their  ranks  and  allowed  his  search.  Not  one  would  have  screened 

him. 
All  would  have  eagerly  poi7ited  him  out  to  fierce  Menelaus 
Had  they  but  seen  him  pass :  for  like  black  death  was  he  hated. 
Thus  then  to  all  out-spake  the  king  of  men  Agamemnon : 
"Hear  me  ye  Greeks,  ye  Dardans,  and  all  ye  allies  of  the  Trojans! 
Victory  now  hath  declared  for  Mars-belov'd  Menelaus. 
You  then,  ye  Trojans !  yield  to  us  Helen  the  fair  and  the  treasure, 
Pay  down  the  ransom  too;  such  fine  as  befits  the  occasion; 
This  to  the  Greeks  shall  belong  and  in  after  years  to  their  children."(46o) 

Ended  the  king,  and  shouted  aloud  in  assent  the  Achaians.

Argument. 


The  Gods  assemble  in  debate  on  the  issue  of  the  coinbat.  Zeus  declares 
the  viclory  to  be  on  the  side  of  Mejielaiis,  and  proposes  the  fitlfilment  of 
the  treaty.  To  this  Hera  and  Pallas  objecl,  and  Zeus  reluctantly  agrees 
to  their  proposal  to  break  it  by  an  acl  of  treachery  on  the  Trojan  part. 
Pandarus,  at  the  instigation  of  Pallas,  aims  an  arrow  at  Menelaiis,  who  is 
wounded,  but  cured  by  Machaon.  The  Trojans  then  advance  to  battle. 
Agamemnon  goes  through  the  army,  exhorting,  encouraging  and  reproving 
the  seve?'al  leaders.  The  Greeks  then  advance.  The  armies  meet  and  the 
battle  commences,  Pallas  sustaining  and  encouraging  the  G?-eeks,  and  Ares 
the  Trojaiis. 


ILIAD.     BOOK  IV. 


ALL  the  gods  in  the  presence  of  Zeus  were  assembled  in  council, 
*       Each  on  his  golden  throne,  while  Hebe,  the  honoured,  among  them 
Poured  forth   the   nectar   in  golden  cups.     And  they  pledged  one 

.  another, 
Quaffing  the  sacred  juice,  and  their  eyes  on  Ilion  bending. 
Forthwith  Kronos'  son,  delighting  to  irritate  Here', 
Taunted  her  thus  with  sarcastic  words  and  covert  reproaches : 

"Two  of  th'  immortal  pow'rs,  great  goddesses,  aid  Menelaiis, 
Argive  Hera  herself  and  Alalcomenean  Athene. 
Yet,  methinks,  they  seem  to  enjoy  that  spectacle  yonder, 
Sitting  inaclive  apart;  while  the  goddess  of  smiles,  Aphrodite7,        (10) 
Still  on  her  fav 'rite  attends,  and  saves  him  from  death  and  destruction. 
See!  how  but  now  she  hath  snatched  him  away  when  fate  was  im- 
pending. 
Truly  the  victory  now  hath  declared  for  brave  Menelaiis. 
Counsel  we  then,  what  turn  unto  these  events  shall  be  given. 
Say!  shall  we  rouse  once  more  fierce  war,  and  the  tumult  of  battle? 
Or  shall  we  rather  unite  both  sides  in  peace  and  in  friendship? 
Could  we  but  all  be  agreed  and  accept  this  simple  conclusion, 
Priam  the  king  might  continue  to  reign  and  his  people  to  prosper; 
Argive  Helen  return  with  her  conquering  Lord  to  Achaia." 

Thus  he  spake.     But  Athena  and  Here  murmuring  heard  him    (20) 
Side    by  side  as  they  sate,  dire  woes  for  the  Trojans  devising. 
Silent  Athene  sate,  nor  uttered  her  thoughts;  but  her  bosom 
Swelled  with  bitter  despite,  and  rage  at  the  words  of  her  Father. 


5—2 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IV. 


Not  so  Hera,  whose  wrath  broke  forth  in  angry  reproaches  : 

"Terrible  son  of  Kronos!  what  word  is  this  thou  hast  uttered? 
How  dost  thou  ever  delight  to  destroy  the  fruits  of  my  labours, 
Frustrating  all  my  toil!     Myself  and  my  coursers  are  weary, 
Hurrying  to  gather  the  hosts,  and  to  heap  destruction  on  Priam! 
Do  as  thou  wilt:  but  expecl  not  that  I  or  the  gods  shall  approve  it." 

Grievously  angered,  Zeus  the  cloud-compeller  responded:        (30) 
"Madly  perverse!  'gainst  thee  what  offence  hath  Priam  committed, 
He,  or  his  sons,  that  implacably  thus  thou  long'st  to  destroy  them; 
Prostrate  to  hurl  in  the  dust  fair  Troy's  embattled  defences? 
Couldst  thou  but  enter  her  gates,  and  range  the  wide  sweep  of  her 

precincts, 
There  to  devour  alive  both  Priam,  his  sons,  and  his  people, 
This,  and  no  less  tha?i  this,  would  assuage  thy  craving  for  vengeance. 
Do  as  thou  wilt,  however;  lest  this  be  a  subject  between  us 
Now  and  for  ever,  henceforth,  of  strife  and  bitter  contention. 
One  thing,  howbeit,  I  tell  thee;  and  well  shalt  thou  do  to  observe  it: 
When  some  city  shall  seem  in  mine  eyes  to  merit  destruction         (40) 
Peopled  by  favorites  of  thine — by  men  thou  lov'st  and  regardest — 
Seek  not  to  stay  me,  nor  come  between  my  wrath  and  its  victims. 
Take  now  the  boon  thou  hast  asked,  though  most  reluctantly  granted : 
Since,  where  the   sun  and  the    stars   of  heav'n  look  down  on  the 

nations, 
Dwellers  on  earth's  wide  region,  through  all  her  inhabited  cities, 
Ilion's  sacred  town  hath  ever  been  first  in  my  favour ; 
Priam,  and, Priam's  sons,  and  the  stalwart  spearmen  of  Troia. 
There  without  ceasing  mine  altars  blaze;  nor  e'er  have  been  lacking 
Savoury  steams  sent  up,  and  libations  poured  in  mine  honour." 

Rolling  her  large  majestic  eyes,  thus  Hera  responded:  (50) 

"Three  great  cities  rejoice  in  my  dear  regard  and  protection, 
Argos,  Sparta  the  fair,  and  the  wide-wayed  town  of  Mycenae. 
These,  should  they  chance  to  offend  thee,  destroy  them  all  in  thine 

anger; 
Nor  will  I  grudge  their  ruin,  or  take  one  step  to  avert  it. 
Well  do  I  know,  howe'er  reluctant,  whatever  my  efforts, 
Thine  is  the  stronger  power,  and  nought  'twould  avail  to  oppose  thee. 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  69 

Now  let  my  wishes  prevail;  nor  make  thou  my  labours  abortive. 
Was  I  not  born  a  goddess— my  race  thine  own,  and  my  lineage — 
Ev'n  as  thyself  from  mysterious  Kronos  sprung;  and  distinguished 
Not  by  my  birth  alone,  but  as  thy  companion  and  consort,  (60) 

Sharing  thy  throne  and  thy  rule  o'er  all  the  other  immortals  ? 
This,  then,  in  mutual  compliance  concede  we  one  to  another, 
Thou  unto  me,  and  I  unto  thee  :  so  shall  all  the  immortals 
Yield  their  assent.     Now  lose  no  time,  but  commission  Athene 
Thither  to  haste  where  the  Trojans  and  Greeks  in  order  of  battle 
Stand,  all  ready  for  fight :  and  bid  her  contrive  that  the  Trojans, 
Treach'rously  breaking  the  truce,  shall  wound  some  noble  Achaian." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  the  father  of  Gods  and  of  mortals  assented, 

Forthwith  addressing  in  swift-winged  words  his  comtnaiids  to  Athene' : 

"  Hie    thee   at   once    to    the  battle-array   of    the    Greeks    and    the 

Trojans,  (70) 

There,  where  they  stand,  all  ready  for  figlit ;    and  contrive   that  the 

Trojans, 
Treach'rously  breaking  the  truce,  shall  wound  some  noble  Achaian." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  Athena  the  welcome  mandate  accepted. 
Down,  at  once,  from  the  lofty  heights  of  Olympus  she  darted ; 
As  when  a  meteor,  sent  by  the  son  of  mysterious  Kronos, 
Glides  through  the  air,  a  portentous  sign  to  fleets  and  to  armies, 
Scatt'ring  abroad  unnumbered  sparks  from  its  fiery  tresses. 
Thus  sped  Pallas  Athena  from  Heazhi  to  the  earth,  and  alighted 
Full  in  the  midst  of  the  host :  and  amazement  seized  the  beholders, 
Horse-taming  Trojans  and  bronze-mailed  Greeks.     And  thus  to  his 
neighbour  (80) 

Each  imparted  the  anxious  thought  which  arose  in  his  bosom: 
"Now   full   soon   shall   we  learn   what   Zeus   in   his   might   hath 
determined, 
What  yon  sign  in  the  sky  may  portend:  whether  war  and  its  horrors, 
Battle  and  strife  shall  revive,  or  peace  at  length  be  established." 

Thus  spake  the  Trojans,  and  thus  the  Greeks,  with  uneasy  foreboding. 
Pallas,  the  while,  in  mortal  form,  through  the  host  of  the  Trojans 
Strode,  like  the  spearman  brave,  Laodocus,  son  of  Antenor, 
Looking  for  Pandarus,  godlike  chief  if  perchance  she  might  find  him. 


70  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IV. 

Soon  she  discovered  Lycaon's  son,  the  brave,  and  the  blameless, 
Stationed  there  at  his  post;  and  around  him  the  ranks  of  his  warriors,  (90) 
Bucklered   men,  who  had  followed  their  chief  from  the  streams  of 

yEsepus. 
Taking  her  stand  by  his  side,  in  swift-wing'd  words  she  addressed  him : 

"Wilt  thou  give  ear  to  my  words,  O  warlike  son  of  Lycaon? 
Venture  a  winged  shaft  at  the  breast  of  brave  Menelaiis. 
So  shalt  thou  win  both  favour  and  fame  at  the  hands  of  the  Trojans, 
One  and  all:  but  chiefest  and  best  from  prince  Alexandros. 
He,  be  assured,  for  thy  deed  with  the  choicest  gifts  shall  requite  thee, 
When  on  his  funeral  pile  outstretched  he  shall  see  Menelaiis, 
Atreus'  son,  his  deadly  foe,  struck  down  by  thine  arrow. 
Now  then  at  once  take  aim,  and  speed  thy  shaft  to  his  bosom,     (too) 
First,  however,  addressing  a  vow  unto  Lycian  Apollo, 
Lord  of  the  bow,  when  to  holy  Zeleia  the  fates  shall  restore  thee, 
There  to  provide  him  a  hundred  firstling  lambs  for  an  off'ring." 
Thus  she  spake,  and  his  reckless  mind  persuaded  to  mischief; 
Straightway  his  polish'd  bow  he  uncased.     Of  horn  was  it- fashioned, 
Borne  long  since  on  the  armed  head  of  a  goat  of  the  mountain 
Which,  from  its  cave  forth  bounding,  he  struck  to  the  heart  from  his 

ambush, 
Aiming  up  from  beneath :  and  it  rolled  from  the  crag  in  its  death-pang. 
Sixteen  palms  from  its  head  grew  forth  its  horns,  which  the  artist 
Skilfully    joined,     and    shaped    to    a    curve,    and    polished     them 

smoothly,  (II0) 

Then  with  a  knosp  of  gold  each  tapering  point  he  completed. 
This  having  bent,  he  held  it  inclined,  and  pointing  obliquely 
Down  to  the  earth;  while  his  comrades  true  their  bucklers  extended, 
Screening  him;  lest  that  the  Greeks  beholding  should  rush  to  assault 

him 
Ere  he  had  slain  their  warlike  chief,  their  brave  Menelaiis. 
Lifting  the  lid  of  his  quiver  next,  he  drew  forth  an  arrow 
Fresh  from  the  maker's  hand,  and,  wing'd  with  fate  and  with  mischief, 
Forthwith  the  keen  and  bitter  shaft  to  the  chord  he  adjusted, 
Praying  the  while,  and  vowing  a  vow  unto  Lycian  Apollo, 
Lord  of  the  bow,  when  to  holy  Zeleia  the  fates  should  restore  him,  (120) 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  71 

There  to  provide  him  a  hundred  firstling  lambs  for  an  ofT'ring. 
Seizing  the  notch  of  the  shaft  on  the  chord,  he  strained;  and  the 

bowstring 
Drew,  till  it  touched  his  breast;  and  the  bow  the  steel  of  the  arrow 
Just  received  on  its  circling  curve ;  then  aiming  he  loosed  it. 
Twanged  the  great  bow,  and  the  chord  rang  loud ;  then  leapt  forth  the 

arrow 
Pointed  and  keen,  and  impatiently  urged  its  flight  through  the  armies. 

Then,  Menelaiis,  th'  immortal  gods  forgat  not  to  guard  thee: 
Chiefest  the  daughter  of  Zeus,  resplendent  with  spoil  and  with  conquest. 
She,  interposing,  averted  the  death,  and  guided  the  arrow 
Lightly  aside  in  its  course  from  a  mortal  part;  as  a  mother  i}Z°) 

Wafts  from  her  infant  a  fly,  while  in  gentle  sleep  he  reposes. 
There  she  directed  the  shaft  where  the  belt  round  his  waist  was  united 
Firmly  with  golden  clasps  o'er  the  thick-lined  plates  of  his  armour. 
Full  on  the  clasps  of  the  belt  that  piercing  weapon  alighted, 
Straight  through  the  rich-chased  metal  it  forced  its  impetuous  passage, 
Then  through  the  gorgeous  corslet  drove;   through  the  part  of  its 

fabric 
Safest  and  surest  of  all  to  protect  its  wearer  in  battle — 
That  on  which  most  he  relied  for  defence;  and  this  too  it  entered 
( Weakened  however  in  force) ;   yet  it  tore  the  flesh  of  the  hero, 
Razing  the   skin :    and    a  stream   of  blood  gushed  forth  on  the  in- 
stant. (x4°) 

As  when,  with  delicate  hand,  some  Masonian  or  Carian  paintress 
Stains  with  purple  an  ivory  boss  for  the  bit  of  a  warhorse: 
Safe  in  her  chamber  stored  she  keeps  it ; — and  many  a  horseman 
Longs  to  possess  it; — in  vain!  for  a  sov'reign  alone  can  obtain  it, 
Grace  to  his  steed  to  impart,  and  worship  to  win  for  the  rider : 
So,  Menelaiis !  thy  fair  white  skin  with  blood  was  impurpled, 
Streaming  adown  thy  well-formed  thighs,  thy  legs  and  thy  ankles. 

Shuddering  horror  seized  on  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
When  from  the  wound  forth-streaming  he  saw  the  blood  of  his  brother. 
Shudd'ring  at  first  Menelaiis  himself  recoiled  for  a  moment,        (150) 
Tden  unaware:  but  his  spirit  was  roused,  and  he  gathered  assurance, 
When  he  perceived  outstanding  the  barbs  and  thong  of  the  arrow. 


74  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IV. 

Sucking  the  blood,  he  applied  that  soothing  balm  which  his  father 
Knew  to  compound,  by  Chiron  taught,  his  friend  and  preceptor. 

Thus  while  the  anxious  chiefs  were  gathered  around  Menelaiis,  (220) 
On  came  rushing  the  Trojan  host,  with  spear  and  with  buckler, 
All  having  donned  their  arms,  and  eagerly  roused  them  to  combat. 
Then  might'st  thou  not  have  seen  Agamemnon  sleeping  or  idle; 
Quailing;  with  fear  unnerved;  or  shunning  the  glorious  battle: 
Welcoming  rather  the  war,  and  rejoicing  to  mix  in  the  conflict. 
Nor  did  he  use  his  panting  steeds,  or  his  glittering  chariot. 
These  to  Eurymedon's  care  he  consigned,  his  faithful  attendant, 
Old  Ptolemaeus'  son,  himself  the  son  of  Pira'is, 
Bidding  him  hold  them  well  in  hand  till  the  time  he  should  need  them, 
Wearied  with  visiting  all,  and  deliv'ring  his  orders  in  person.        (230) 
Then,  proceeding  on  foot,  he  traversed  the  ranks  of  the  heroes. 
Such  as  he  found  alert,  and  urging  their  steeds  to  the  combat, 
These  with  encouraging  words  he  cheered :  and  thus  he  addressed  them : 

"Argives  !  be  true  to  your  fame,  and  remit  no  spark  of  your  ardour! 
Father  Zeus  will  ne'er  stand  forth  an  abettor  of  falsehood. 
Those  who  have  trampled  on  oaths  and  set  the  example  of  treach'ry, 
Vultures,  be  sure,  shall  feast  on  their  dainty  flesh,  and  in  triumph 
Home  shall  we  bear  their  dear-loved  wives  and  innocent  children, 
Loading  our  ships  with  spoil,  when  their  city  shall  smoke  in  its  ruins." 

Those  whom   ling'ring   he  found,  and   shunning   the    dangers   of 
battle,  (240) 

Such  he  reproved  with  taunting  words  and  angry  reproaches: 

" 'Argives,  forsooth /  no  better  than  bowmen  !  shame  on  ye,  recreants! 
Why  do  ye  stand,  like  hunted  fawns,  all  scared  and  astounded, 
When  with  fatigue  and  terror  exhausted  they  huddle  together 
Gazing  around,  while  strength  there  is  none,  nor  courage  within  them  ? 
Thus  do  ye  stand  amazed,  and  thus  ye  shrink  from  the  battle. 
What!  will  ye  wait  till  the  Trojans  advancing  seize  on  your  vessels 
There,  where  their  prows  stand  ranged  on  the  surf-beat  shore  of  the 

ocean, 
Trusting  that  Zeus  will  then  stretch  forth  his  hand  for  your  rescue?" 

Thus,  with  words  of  praise  and  of  blame,  through  the  ranks  of  the 
heroes  (250) 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  7S 

Passing,  at  length  to  the  Cretans  he  came,  where  the  throng  was  the 

densest; 
Where,  round  Idomeneus,  armed  for  fight,  his  troops  were  collected: 
He  in  their  van  conspicuous,  in  might  like  the  boar  of  the  forest; 
While  in  the  rear  Meriones  urged  them  on  and  encouraged. 
Pleased  was  the  king  of  men  when  he  found  them  ready  for  action, 
And  from  his  lips  there  fell  such  words  as  to  heroes  are  sweetest : 

"Noble  Idomeneus  !  first  of  the  swift-horsed  sons  of  Achaia, 
Thee  do  I  honour,  alike  in  battle,  in  council,  and  conduct, 
And  at  the  festal  board  when  the  choice  red  wine  is  o'erflowing. 
There,  while  our  bravest  chiefs  by  measure  drink,  and  in  order,    (260) 
Ever  thy  cup  stands  full,  like  mine  own,  unstinted,  beside  thee, 
Freely  to  quaff,  as  thy  soul  inclines,  or  abstain  if  it  list  thee. 
Such,  among  all  our  crested  Greeks,  is  the  meed  of  thy  valour. 
Now  then  maintain  thy  fame.    March  on !  and  be  first  in  the  combat." 
Thus  then  Idomeneus  answered,  the  warlike  chief  of  the  Cretans : 
"  Atreus'  son !  depend  on  me  for  a  trusty  supporter 
Now  and  henceforth :  for  such  was  my  promise — such  was  our  compact. 
Go  now !  excite  the  rest  of  the  crested  Greeks  in  the  battle 
Bravely  to  fight ;  since  the  truce  is  void  by  this  act  of  the  Trojans. 
Death   to   the  perjured  race!   Let  the  curse  that  rests   011   the  van- 

quished  (270) 

Cling  to  the  men  who  have  spurned  their  oaths   and  trampled  on 

treaties." 
Thus  he  spake:  and  Atreides  rejoicing  went  on  his  progress. 
Next  to  th'  Aiantes  he  came;  and  these,  full  armed  and  appointed, 
Ready  for  fight  he  found,  and  a  cloud  of  footmen  around  them. 
As  when  from  some  commanding  cliff,  looking  forth  on  the  waters 
Lowering  and  borne  from  afar,  some  goatherd  sees  in  the  distance, 
Driv'n  by  the  blast  of  zephyr,  a  storm-cloud  sweep  o'er  the  ocean; 
On    it   comes,    with   the   blackness    of  pitch,    and   the   hurtling   of 

whirlwinds : 
Shrinking  he  views  its  advance,  and  hides  his  flock  in  a  cavern, — 
Dark'ning    thus,    and   in    threat'ning    array,    with   spear    and    with 

buckler  (280) 

Bristling,  marched  to  the  fight  the  banded  youth  of  the  Locrians 


76  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IV. 

Serried  in  phalanx;  eager  for  war;  at  the  call   of  the  heroes. 

This  with  delight  beheld  the  wide-ruling  Prince  Agamemnon, 
Nor  was  his  joy  concealed,  but  in  swift-wing'd  words  he  addressed  them, 
"  Glorious  Aiantes !  worthy  to  lead  our  bronze-mailed  Achaians ! 
You  it  becomes  not  me  to  exhort  or  with  words  to  encourage. 
Ready,  aye  ready,  I  find  you  to  lead  your  troops  to  the  battle. 
Oh!  may  our  Father  Zeus,  and  Apollo,  and  Pallas  Athene, 
Kindle  in  every  Grecian  breast  such  courage  and  ardour! 
Then  full  soon  shall  we  see  the  royal  city  of  Priam  (29°) 

Bow  to  its  fall,  by  our  arms  subdued,  and  scattered  in  ruin." 
Thus  having  said,  the  Locrians  he  left,  and  the  Pylian  legions 
Sought,  where  Nestor  he  found,  their  sage  and  eloquent  leader, 
Wisely  arraying  their  ranks,  and  by  words  exciting  their  ardour. 
Pelagon,  Chronius,  Alastor,  were  nigh,  receiving  his  orders, 
Haemon  the  prince,  and  Bias,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people. 
Foremost  the  horsemen  he  placed  with  their  steeds  and  chariots  in 

order; 
All  the  best  of  his  foot,  the  strength  and  support  of  the  battle, 
Num'rous  and  brave,  in  the  rear;  while  between  them  the  wav'rers 

were  driven, 
Leaving  them  no  retreat,  no  choice,  but  to  fight  like  their  comrades.  (300) 
First  to  the  charioteers  he  gave  this  pressing  injunction: 
Well  to  rein  in  their  steeds,  nor  confound  their  cars  in  the  tumult. 
"Hear  me!"  he  cried,  "let  none,  whate'er  his  skill  or  his  courage, 
Push  in  advance  of  the  rest  and  singly  charge  on  the  Trojans. 
Neither  let  any  one  lag;    for  to  break  your  li?ie  is  destruction. 
He  who,  erect,  in  his  chariot  an  adverse  car  shall  encounter, 
Thrust  with  his  lance  where  he  stands.     'Tis  the  surer  way,  by  our 

fathers 
Practised : — heroes  whom  nought  could  resist,  nor  city  nor  fortress. 
This  was  their  rule  of  fight,  and  from  this  they  never  departed." 

Thus  that  ancient  chief,  from  his  long  experience  in  battles.     (310) 
Him  Agamemnon  rejoicing  heard;  and,  cordially  greeting, 
Warmly  his  feelings  spoke ;  and  thus  in  words  he  addressed  him  : 
"Oh  !  what  a  fire  yet  glows  in  that  dear  old  heart!   Would  to  heaven 
Strength  to  match  it  were  thine,  and  youthful  limbs  unexhausted ! 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  77 

Age,  however,  the  lot  of  man,  weighs  heavily  on  thee. 
Would  that  a  younger  might  bear  thy  load,  and  could  give  thee  his 
vigour!" 
Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight,  this  answer  returned  him: 
"Would,  great  Atreus'  son!  that  again  I  might  be  for  thy  service 
Such  as  of  yore  I  was,  when  I  slew  the  brave  Ereuthalion. 
But  the  blest  Gods  all  at  once  their  gifts  on  mortals  bestow  not.  (320) 
Then  was  I  young,  but  now  am  old ;  yet  still  shalt  thou  find  me 
Here  at  my  post,  with  my  horsemen  brave,  commanding  and  cheering; 
Fighting  with  skill,  not  weapons;  for  such  is  the  war  of  the  aged. 
Those  let  the  ardent  and  young,  who  rejoice  in  the  bloom  of  their 

vigour 
Wield  with  efifecl:  for  to  such  belongs  the  brunt  of  the  battle."      [325] 

Thus  he  spake,  while  onward  passed  Agamemnon  rejoicing. 
Mnestheus,  Peteos'  son,  then  he  found  at  the  head  of  his  horsemen; 
Round  him  stood  the  Athenian  bands,  far  famed  for  their  war-cry. 
There  too  Odysseus  he  saw,  that  man  of  many  devices, 
Must'ring  his  Cephallenian  troops — no  nation  of  cowards         (330) 
They:  but  not  yet  had  they  heard  th'  advancing  shout  of  the  Trojans 
Rushing  to  fight,  nor  perceived  that  the  Greeks  were  preparing  for 

battle. 
Therefore  inactive  they  stood,  nor  closed  their  ranks;  as  expecting 
Others  to  lead  the  way  and  commence  the  fight  with  the  Trojans.  [335] 
This  when  Atreides  saw,  he  was  vexed,  and  in  words  of  reproval, 
Uttered  with  warmth,  and  in  haste,  the  sov'reign  of  nations  addressed 
them  : 
"Offspring  of  Peteos  brave,  that  prince  the  fav'rite  of  heaven; 
Thou  too  accomplished  in  artifice  keen,  still  seeking  thy  profit ! 
W7hy  do  ye  stand  thus  cow'ring  aloof  and  waiting  for  others? 
You  had  it  better  beseemed  to  have  led  the   way,  and  have  ven- 
tured (340) 
Foremost;   flinging  yourselves  on  the  fiery  front  of  the  battle. 
Is  it  for  deeds  like  this  that  first  to  our  feasts  ye  are  bidden 
When  in  our  presence  the  banquet  is  spread  for  the  chiefs  of  Achaia? 
There  ye  delight  to  gorge  the  savoury  roast,  and  unstinted    [345] 
Goblets  to  drain  of  the  luscious  wine,  first  choice  of  the  vintage: 


78  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Ecok  IV. 

Here  would  ye  gazing  stand,  while  troop  upon  troop  of  the  Grecians 
Swept  to  the  war  in  your  very  sight,  and  left  you  behind  them." 

Sternly  regarding  him,  thus  then  answered  the  godlike  Odysseus : 
"  Ha !  what  a  word  hath  escaped  from  between  thy  teeth,  O  Atreides ! 
I  from  the  conflict  shrink?   Let  the  Onset  come,  and  the  Grecians  (350) 
Down  on  the  Trojans  pour  with  the  fearful  weight  of  their  vengeance : 
Then  shalt  thou  see  (if  thou  care  in  such  scenes  to  mix)  this  intriguer 
— Me — Telemachus'  Father — the  first  in  the  deadly  encounter. 
Pass  on  thy  way  !   Thy  words,  like  the  empty  wind,  I  regard  not."  [355] 

But  when  he  saw  that  Odysseus  was  wroth,  and  resented  his  chiding, 
Quickly  he  made  amends,  and  at  once  retracting  the  insult, 
Smilingly  thus  in  turn  replied  the  Prince  Agamemnon : 
"Godlike  son  of  Laertes!  most  wise  and  inventive  Odysseus! 
Think  not  I  mean  severely  to  chide,  or  censure  thy  conduct. 
Sure  I  am  that  the  heart  in  thy  inmost  bosom  admits  not      (360) 
Aught  save  that  which  is  friendly  and  right — for  our  thoughts  are  in 

common. 
Come!  dismiss  we  the  subjecl  now.     We  can  quarrel  at  leisure. 
Yet,  if  aught  wrong  hath  been  said,  may  the  great  Gods  render  it 
harmless." 

Thus  having  spoken,  he  left  them  there,  and  proceeded  to  others. 
Next  he  encountered  Tydeus'  son,  the  proud  Diomedes,  [365] 

Standing  among  the  steeds  and  the  strong-built  cars  of  his  horsemen. 
Near  him  Sthenelus  stood,  great  Capaneus'  son :  whom  beholding 
Ready  indeed  for  fight,  but  not  yet  moving  to  aclion, 
Sore  displeased,  in  reproachful  terms  Agamemnon  addressed  him  : 

"Why,  O  Tydeides!  son  of  the  fierce  subduer  of  horses,      (370) 
Why  dost  thou  cower  and  anxiously  scan  the  lines  of  our  battle? 
Tydeus  thy  sire  was  not  thus  wont  to  shrink  and  to  tremble: 
Foremost  ever  he  rushed  on  his  foes  in  advance  of  his  comrades. 
Those  who  have  seen  him  fight  thus  wond'ritigly  tell  of  his  onset  : 
Bravest  of  men !  ('tis  from  fame  I  speak,  for  I  never  beheld  him) 
Once  indeed  to  Mycenae  he  came,  with  divine  Polyneices, 
Aid  and  alliance  to  seek,  while  preparing  for  war  with  the  Thebans, 
Trusting  their  sacred  city  to  capture.     Much  they  besought  us 
Well-tried  troops  to  provide,  and  to  bear  our  part  in  the  war/are. 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  79 

We  on  our  side  were  willing,    and  troops  and  arms  had  been  fur- 
nished (380) 
Gladly:   but  Zeus  with  dire  portents  forewarned  us  of  evil. 
Thus  they  departed,  their  end  unaccomplished,  journeying  homewards 
Back  to  the  rush-grown  banks  and  the  grassy  meads  of  Asopus. 
Thence,  as  an  envoy,  sent  from  th'  Achaian  states,  tmto  Thebe 
Tydeiis  came,  and  he  found  the  Cadmeans  in  joyous  carousal, 
Banqueting  high  in  the  regal  halls  of  their  Prince  Eteocles. 
He,  not  a  whit  dismayed  nor  bashful;  alone,  and  a  stranger, 
Ent'ring;   a  guest  tmexpecled,  among  so  many  Cadmeans, 
Challenged  them  all  to  contend  in  athletic  sports — and  he  conquered 
Easily  every  man.     Such  aid  did  Pallas  afford  him.  (390) 
They  however,    rough-riding  men,  vowed  vengeance,  and  choosing 
Fifty  adventurous  youths,  his  path  beset  as  he  journeyed 
Homeward,  his  errand  performed.     Two  leaders  headed  the  onset, 
Maeon  the  son  of  Haemus,  of  godlike  valour  and  fierceness, 
And  Lycophontes,  Autophonus'  son,  unflinching  in  combat — 
All  were  by  Tydeus   slain.     Foul  death  upon  all  he  inflicted. 
Maeon  alone  he  spared  and  dismissed  unharmed,  by  an  omen 
Wasned :  and  home  he  returned  to  relate  the  fate  of  his  comrades. 
Such  was  ^Etolian  Tydeus. — Here  is  his  son:   as  a  warrior 
Hardly  so  great  as  his  sire,  though  much  the  better  declaimer."   (400) 

Thus  he  spake.     But  the  brave  Diomedes  answered  him  nothing : 
Such  was  the  rev'rence  he  paid  to  the  dread  rebuke  of  his  Sov'reign. 
Not  so  Capaneus'  son,  who  thus  retorted,   (his  anger 
Roused  by   the  taunt)    "Atreides !    thy   words   are  false :    and    thou 

know'st  it. 
Better  by  far  are  we,  and  braver  men  than  our  fathers. 
Fewer  in  number  than  they,  that  Theban  city  we  captured, 
Marched  through  its  sev'n-fold  gates,  and  levelled  its  haughty  defences, 
Strong  in  the  might  of  Zeus,  and  trusting  the  signs  that  he  gave  us. 
They  by  their  own  misconduct  failed  where  their  sons  have  succeeded. 
Say  not  then   that   our  fathers  were   better   than  we,  or  more  glo- 
rious." (4IQ) 

Then  with  a  frown  of  stern  reproof  Diomedes  addressed  him  : 
"Silence!  my  good  old  friend.     Suppress  thy  wrath  and  obey  me. 


80  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IV. 

How  can  we  blame  Agamemnon,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
When  he  excites  the  Greeks,  and  stirs  them  up  to  the  combat? 
His  will  the  glory  be,  and  the  gain,  should  the  might  of  Achaia 
Conquer  our  Trojan  foes  and  lay  their  city  in  ruins: 
His  too  the  grief  and  shame  should  we  fail,  and  the  Grecians  be 

vanquished. 
Come  then!  think  we  of  nought  but  of  martial  deeds  and  of  glory." 
Thus  having  said,  on  the  ground,  full  armed,  he  sprang  from  his 

chariot. 
Dire  was  the  clash  of  the  brazen  scales  on  the  breast  of  the  hero  (420) 
Striding  along.     Right   brave  were  the  heart   that  unmoved  could 

have  heard  it. 
As  on  the  loud-resounding  shore  the  broad  waves  of  the  ocean 
Driv'n  by  the  Zephyr's  force  roll  on  in  unbroken  succession, 
Far  at  first  in  the  offing  they  swell  to  a  crest,  and  arriving 
Burst  on  the  beach  with  thundering  crash :  each  rock  that  obstructs 

them 
Curving  aloft,  they  whelm,  and  spit  forth  the  foam  from  their  eddies : 
Thus  in  succeeding  ranks  moved  on  the  troops  of  the  Grecians 
Ceaseless,  line  upon  line,  to  the  fight :  each  chieftain  among  them 
Heading  his  own  array.     All  silent  they  marched.     Had  you  seen 

them 
Such  and  so  vast  a  force,  in  their  noiseless  order  advancing,  (430) 
Speech  you  had  thought  denied  them,  or  lost  in  awe  of  their  leaders ; 
While    as   they   moved   their  various   arms   glanced   bright  in   the 

sunbeam. 
Thus   they   advanced.      But   the   Trojan    host,   as    sheep,   who   by 

thousands 
Ready  to  milk  in  the  fold  of  some  rich  man  are  collected, 
Hearing  the  cries  of  their  lambs,  reply  with  bleating  incessant, 
Thus  with  tumultuous  shouts  came  on.     Confused  was  their  war-cry, 
Various  their  language.     Nations  remote  were  banded  together, 
Joi?iing  in  one  wild  scream,  and  rending  the  sky  with  their  damoicr. 
These  were  by  Ares  inspired,  but  those  by  blue-eyed  Athene. 
Terror  was  there,  and  Rout,  and  Strife  insatiably  raging :  (440) 
Strife,  dread  sister  and  constant  attendant  on  murderous  Ares, 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  81 

(Small  she  springs  up  at  birth,  but  soon  gigantic  in  stature 
Stalks  she  abroad,  her  feet  upon  earth,  her  head  in  the  heavens), 
Wide  through  the  mingling  mass  she  flung  forth  the  seeds  of  contention, 
Fost'ring  the  fires  of  hate,  and  deep'ning  the  groans  of  the  heroes. 
Now  when  at  length  the  hosts  were  met  and  were  hurled  on  each 
other, 
Clashed  together  their  spears  and  the  tough  bull-hides  of  their  bucklers, 
Breast  against  breast  and  might  against  might  they  drove,  and  the 

bosses 
Round,  of  their  shields,  met  rude,  and  dire  was  the  crash  of  their 

meeting. 
Then  to  the  sky  broke  forth  loud  shouts  and  groans  of  the  heroes  (450) 
Slaying  and  slain.     Then  streamed  with  blood  the  ground  that  they 

trampled. 
As  when  two  torrents,  deep  in  the  hollow  ravines  of  a  mountain, 
Each  from  a  plenteous  source,  and  swollen  by  the  rains  of  the  winter, 
Foam  where  they  meet,  and  boil  in  the  rocky  pool  that  receives  them : 
Far  o'er  the  echoing  hills  their  roar  is  heard  by  the  shepherd: 
Thus  rose  the  shouts  and  shrieks  from  the  mingling  hosts  of  the 
warriors. 
First  of  the  Trojans  slain  was  Teleiisias'  son,  Echepdlus, 
Bravely  leading  their  van.    From  Antilochus  found  he  his  death-wound. 
He  on  his  crested  helm  received  the  spear;    and  it  entered, 
Tearing  the  cone  in  its  course :  then,  piercing  the  bone  of  the  fore- 
head, (460) 
Fixed  itself  deep  in  his  skull.     So  darkness  gathered  around  him. 
Down  he  sank,  with  a  crash,  like  a  falling  tow'r  in  a  tempest. 
Him  when  he  fell,  Elephenor  seized  by  the  feet;  Elephenor, 
Great  Chalcodon's  son,  brave  chief  of  the  fiery  Abantes, 
Hast'ning  to  drag  him  beyond  the  reach  of  the  darts,  and  despoil  him, 
Stripping  his  arms  at  once.    But  brief  was  the  moment  allowed  him. 
Mighty  Agenor  beheld  him  dragging  the  dead,  and  his  jav'lin 
Drove  (as  he  stooped,  and  his  side  displayed,  by  his  buckler  unguarded) 
Furious  between  his  ribs.     His  knees  gave  way,  and  his  spirit 
Fled,  while  his  life-blood  ebbed.     Then  arose  a  fiery  conflict           (470) 
Over  the  dead,  where  Trojans  and  Greeks  like  wolves  were  contending, 


82  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IV. 

Closing,  man  upon  man,  and  dashing  themselves  on  each  other. 

Then  Telamonian  Aias,  Anthemion's  son  Simoeiseus 
Slew,  in  the  opening  bloom  of  his  bright  young  days ;  whom  his  mother 
Gave  to  the  light  on  Simoi's'  banks,  what  time  with  her  parents 
Down  from  Ida  she  came  to  inspect  their  flocks.    And  she  called  him 
Hence  Simoeiseus  by  name.     Ah!  sad  return  for  her  fondness. 
Brief,  too  brief  was  the  span  of  his  life :  for  merciless  Aias 
Brandished  aloft  his  mighty  spear,  and  cut  short  his  existence. 
Bravely  in  youthful  pride  he  came  on,  but  the  spear  of  the  warrior  (480) 
Pierced  his  right  breast  in  the  pap,  and  forced  its  way  through  the 

shoulder. 
Down  he  dropped,  and  rolled  on  the  earth  in  the  dust.     As  a  poplar 
Grown  upon  some  wide  watered  mead,  at  the  meeting  of  rivers, 
Smooth  in  stem,  and  with  branching  boughs  displayed  to  the  breezes, 
Yields  them  at  length  to  the  keen  and  ruthless  axe  of  the  wainwright ; 
Destined  to  form  the  circling  curve  for  the  wheel  of  a  chariot. 
Prostrate  and  with'ring  it  lies  on  the  banks  of  the  stream  that  it  shaded. 
Thus  sank  young  Simoeiseus,  a  prey  to  conquering  Aias, 
Spoiled  of  his  beauteous  arms.    Then  Antiphus,  offspring  of  Priam, 
Gay  in  his  varied  corselet,  his  sharp  spear  hurled  at  the  victor :   (490) 
Aias  it  missed;  but  Leucus,  Odysseus'  friend  and  companion, 
Struck  in  the  groin  while  dragging  aside  the  corpse,  and  upon  it 
Down  he  sank,  relaxing  his  grasp,  and  darkness  involved  him. 
Dire  was  Odysseus'  rage  when  he  saw  the  fall  of  his  comrade  : 
Forward  he  rushed,  resplendent  in  arms,  to  the  front  of  the  battle, 
Close  to  the  Trojans  he  came,  and  warily  looking  around  him, 
Hurled  in  their  midst  his  lance.     They  shrank  from  the  blow  and 

retreated, 
Dreading  his  aim.     Yet  not  in  vain  was  the  weapon  delivered. 
Hapless  Democoon,  Priam's  son,  was  destined  to  feel  it, 
Who  from  Abydos  came,  where  the  steeds  of  Priam  were  nurtured.  (500) 
Him  through  the  temples  pierced  that  deadly  spear,  by  Odysseus 
Forcefully  hurled,  in  vengeance  dire  for  the  death  of  his  comrade. 
Down  he  sank  on  the  earth,  and  darkness  gathered  around  him, 
While  in  his  fall,  with  a  pond'rous  clash,  loud  rattled  his  armour. 
Then  gave  back  ev'n  Hector  himself,  and  the  line  of  the  Trojans  : 


Book  IV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  83 

Shouted  triumphant  the  Greeks,  as  they  dragged  forth  the  dead  to 

despoil  them. 
Then  rushed  forward  amain  for  a  fresh  assault     But  Apollo, 
Wrathful,  from  Ilion  saw  them,  and,  shouting,  encouraged  the  Trojans: 
"Rouse. ye!  Horsemen  of  Troy.     Stand  firm,  nor  yield  to  the  Grecians. 
Nor  are  their  bodies  rocks,  nor  of  steel  their  flesh,  that  your  lances  (510) 
Back  should  recoil  when  ye  strike  them  home.    Remember  !  Achilles, 
He  that  chief  whom  ye  dread,  the  unconquered  offspring  of  Thetis, 
Fights  no  more.     In  his  ships  withdrawn  he  broods  o'er  his  anger." 

Thus  spake  the  dreadful  God  from  Pergamus'  height.     But  AthenS 
Jove's  Tritonian  daughter,  resplendent  in  glory,  the  Grecians 
Urged  and  inspired,  pervading  their  ranks  and  exalting  their  ardour; 
Quick'ning  the  loitering  foot,  and  nerving  the  arm  of  the  valiant. 

Then  fell  Diores  brave,  Amarynchus'  son,  whom  the  Thracian 
Peirous,  Imbrasus'  son,  who  the  warriors  of  Enos  commanded, 
Struck  with  a  jagged  stone.     On  his  dexter  ankle  it  lighted,    (520) 
Crushing  the  bone,  and  relentless  tearing  the  sinews  asunder : 
Such  was  its  headlong  force.     Supine  he  fell,  and  expiring 
Stretched  forth  both  his  hands  to  his  comrades  dear.     But  the  victor 
Following  up  the  blow,  with  his  spear  rushed  forward  and  plunged  it, 
There  in  the  dust  as  he  lay,  in  his  navel,  deep,  and  his  entrails 
Gushed  forth  at  once  from  the  wound,  and  darkness  closed  o'er  his 

eyelids. 
Him  in  his  turn  yEtolian  Thoas  pierced  with  his  jav'lin 
Straight  through  the  chest — and  deep  in  his  lungs  the  weapon  was  buried. 
Close  approaching,  he  then  tore  forth  the  spear  from  his  bosom, 
Tugging  amain;  and,  unsheathing  his  sharp  and  glittering  falchion,  (530) 
Dealt  him,  athwart,  a  deadly  gash,  and  his  spirit  forsook  him. 
Yet  became  not  his  arms  the  victor's  spoil:    for  his  comrades, 
Tufted  Thracians,  with  spears  advanced,  surrounded  the  body, 
Forcing  him,  great  as  he  was  and  renowned  for  his  strength  and  his 

valour, 
Back  from  his  prey  reluclant,  and  step  by  step  he  retreated. 
There  in  the  dust  now  lay  those  rival  heroes  extended, 
Leaders  both;  of  the  Thracian  host  and  the  bronze-mailed  Epeans, 
Side  by  side;  and  with  many  a  warrior  slaughtered  around  them.

None  who  had  looked  on  that  day's  work,  had  he  passed  through 
the  combat 
Safe  and  unharmed  by  sword  or  lance,  by  Pallas  Athene         (54°) 
Led  by  the  hand  secure,  and  impartially  scanning  its  conducl, 
Aught  had  beheld  to  reprove,  or  deed  unworthy  of  heroes. 
Trojans  and  Greeks  alike  had  he  seen  struck  down  and  expiring, 
Prone  in  the  dust, — their  wounds  in  front;  partakers  in  glory.      (544)

Argument. 


The  battle  continues.  Diomede  and  his  exploits.  Though  wounded 
by  Pandarus,  he  is  sustained  and  invigorated  by  Pallas,  and  fights  more 
fiercely  than  before.  JEneas  and  Pandarus  join  to  attack  him.  He  slays 
Pandarus,  and  wounds  and  would  have  slaiii  JEneas  also  but  for  the  inter- 
vention of  Aphrodite,  who  carries  him  off.  At  the  instigation  of  Pallas  he 
pursues  and  wounds  her.  She  drops  JEneas,  and  retreats  to  Olympus. 
Apollo  saves  him  from  Diomede 's  renewed  attack,  heals  his  wound,  and 
restores  him  to  the  fight.  The  Trojans  under  Heclor,  Sarpedon  and  JEneas 
advance  anew  to  the  combat,  led  on  by  Ares.  Their  exploits.  Dio?nede 
and  the  Greeks  are  checked.  Hera  and  Pallas  descend  and  encourage  the 
Greeks.  Pallas  supports  Diomede ;  who  meets  and  wounds  Ares,  who 
retreats  to  Olympus.     The  two  Goddesses  then  quit  the  field.

IV TOW  upon  Tydeus'  son  Diomedes,  Pallas  Athene 

Valour  and  might  bestowed;  that  the  foremost  man  of  the  Argives 
Proud  he  should  stand  distinguished,  and  glory  and  fame  be  his  portion. 
Flashing  afar,  with  restless  gleam,  from  his  shield  and  his  helmet 
Streamed   forth  a  fire,  like  that  which  the  bright  star  flings  in  the 

autumn, 
Fresh  from  its  ocean  bath  when  renewed  in  splendour  it  rises. 
Such  was   the    dazzling   light  that  played  round  his  head   and   his 

shoulders, 
While,  by  the  Goddess  impelled,  he  plunged  through  the  thick  of  the 

combat. 
One  of  the  Trojans,  a  wealthy  and  blameless  priest  of  Hephaestus, 
Dares  by  name  (so  it  chanced),  two  sons  had  sent  to  the  army,      (10) 
Phegeus,  Idaeus,  both  to  all  kinds  of  fighting  accustomed. 
These  in  advance  of  the  line  in  their  car  came  rushing  upon  him, 
Drawn  by  two  fiery  steeds,  while  Tydeides  on  foot  was  advancing. 
Nearing  each  other  thus,  when  now  small  space  was  between  them, 
Phegeus  first  dismissed  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin. 
False  to  his  ai?Ji,  his  mark  he  missed;  and  the  glittering  weapon 
Over  the  chiefs  left  shoulder  passed.     In  turn,  Diomedes 
Darted  his  spear.     This  flew  not  in  vain  from  the  hand  of  the  hero. 
Full  in  his  chest  it  struck,  and  hurled  him  prone  from  his  chariot. 
Down  from  the  beauteous  car  Idaeus  sprang;  nor  adventured,         (20) 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 


Een  for  a  moment,  to  stay  and  protect  the  corse  of  his  brother. 
Yet  not  thus,  not  thus  had  he  shunned  black  death  and  its  horrors, 
Had   not    Hephoestus   been  nigh,  and    snatched  him,  in  mist,  from 

destruction, 
Saving  from  utter  bereavement  his  old  and  desolate  parent. 
Seizing  the  steeds  and  the  car,  the  son  of  magnanimous  Tydeus 
Gave  them  in  charge  to  his  faithful  friends,  to  the  ships  to  conduct 

them. 
But  when  the  Trojans  beheld  those  two  brave  children  of  Dares, 
One  betaken  to  flight,  and  one  lying  dead  by  his  chariot, 
All  their  hearts  with  alarm  were  filled.     Then  blue-eyed  Athene', 
Grasping  his  hand,  these  words  addressed  to  the  ruler  of  battles  :  (30) 
"Ares!  Ares  blood-stain'd  !  destroyer!  subverter  of  ramparts! 
Shall   we   not  leave  these  Trojans  and  Greeks  to  contend  for   the 

mast'ry  ? 
Leave  to  our  Father  Zeus  to  decide  on  the  issues  of  battle, 
We  on  our  part  retiring  obedient,  shunning  his  anger?" 
Thus  she  spake,  and  led  fierce  Ares  forth  from  the  combat, 
Seating  him  quietly  down  on  the  grass-grown  bank  of  Scamander. 
Then  did  the  Greeks  prevail,  and  the  Trojans  fled.     From  among 

them 
Each  of  the  Argive  chiefs  chose  forth  his  man.     Agamemnon 
Hodius,  the  Halizonian  prince,  first  hurled  from  his  chariot. 
Ev'n  as  he  turned  him  to  flight,  the  spear  through  his  back  found  a 

passage,  (40) 

Ent'ring  between  his  shoulders  and  issuing  forth  through  his  bosom : 
Down  he  fell  with  a  crash,  and  his  arms  loud  rattled  around  him. 
Slain  by  Idomeneus'  hand  was  the  son  of  Maeonian  Borus, 
Phsestus,  who  came  to  the  war  from  the  fertile  region  of  Tarne; 
Him,  with  his  long  protended  spear,  the  prince  of  the  Cretans  [45] 
Through  the  right  shoulder  pierced,  in  the  act  of  mounting  his  chariot : 
Down  he  fell  from  the  car,  while  darkness  gathered  around  him. 
On  went  the  prince,  and  his  followers  spoiled  the  corse  of  its  armour. 

Next,  Scamandrius,  Strophius'  son,  delighting  in  wood-craft, 
Fell  to  the  tough  ash  spear  of  Atreus'  son,  Menelaiis.  (50) 

Artemis  self  had  taught  him  the  craft  and  lore  of  the  hunter: 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


How  to  transfix,  or  ensnare  each  beast  that  roams  in  the  forest. 
This  time  Artemis  aided  him  not — nor  aught  might  avail  him 
Shafts  and  bow,  or  the  skill  which  the  huntress  Queen  had  imparted; 
For,  as  he  fled,  Menelaus'  spear  through  his  back  found  a  passage, 
Ent'ring  between  his  shoulders,  and  issuing  forth  through  his  bosom, 
Prone  on  his  face  he  fell,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him. 

Slain  by  Meriones'  hand  was  Pherecles,  son  of  the  artist 
Harmonides,  much  favoured  and  loved  by  Pallas  Athene';  [60] 

Famed,  like  his  sire,  for  dext'rous  skill  and  the  lore  of  the  craftsman. 
Built  by  him  were  the  ships  which  bore  Alexander  to  Argos;  (61) 

Ill-fated  ships!     Dire  source  of  mischief  and  woe  to  the  Trojans, 
And  to  himself: — for  he  knew  not  the  fates,  or  their  warning  neglecled. 
Him,  as  he  fled,  Meriones  reached  with  his  lance,  and  he  struck  him 
Through  the  right  hip  from  behind.  The  point  passed  straight  through 

the  bladder, 
Grazing  the  bone :  on  his  knees  he  dropped,  all  piteously  shrieking. 
Death  with  its  mantling  pall  enwrapped  at  length,  and  released  him. 

Then  fell  Pedaeus,  the  great  Antenor's  son,  whom  a  stranger 
Gave  to  his  love;  and  the  gertrous  care  of  the  noble  Theano    [70] 
Like  her  own  children  nursed,  through  fond  regard  for  her  husband. 
Meges,  Phyleus'  son,  o'ertook  him  in  flight;  and  he  smote  him      (71) 
Right  through  the  nape  of  his  neck  at  the  back  of  his  head;  and  the 

weapon 
Cut   through   his  tongue,    and  between  his  teeth  stood  forth :  and, 

expiring, 
Down  he  sank  in  the  dust,  the  cold  steel  in  his  agony  biting. 

Siain  by  Eurypylus  next  was  Hypsenor,  son  of  Dolopion, 
Godlike  son  of  a  haughty  sire,  a  priest  of  Scamander; 
Ev'n  as  the  God  he  served  almost  by  the  people  regarded. 
For  as  he  ran  with  the  rest,  the  valiant  son  of  Evaemon,  [79] 

Foil' wing  him  up  in  his  headlong  flight,  with  his  sword  on  the  shoulder 
Dealt  him  a  sweeping  blow,  and  his  arm  cut  sheer  from  his  body.  (80) 
Down  fell  the  bleeding  limb  on  the  plain;  while  sinking  in  darkness 
Death  and  resistless  fate  in  their  purple  shadow  involved  him. 

Thus  while  the  chiefs  toiled  on  through  the  roar  and  rage  of  the 
battle, 


90  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Hard  'twere  to  say  to  which  of  the  hosts  belonged  Diomedes ; 
Now  in  the  Trojan  rout  involved,  now  mixed  with  the  Grecians. 
Wide  o'er  the  field  he  rushed,  with  the  headlong  force  of  a  torrent 
Swoln  by  the  wint'ry  rain,  when  it  bursts  its  banks,  and  in  ruin 
Bridges  uptorn  are  hurried  away;  and  the  dykes  that  confined  it 
Swept  from  the  shores  and  engulphed  in  swift  and  sudden  destruction. 
All  the  wealth  of  the  smiling  fields  disappears  in  a  moment:    (90) 
Vanish   the   works   of  man,  and   the    husbandman's   hopes  are   ex- 
tinguished. 
Thus  did  Tydeides  sweep  from  the  field  the  hosts  of  the  Trojans, 
Scatt'ring  in  flight.    Not  one  among  all  their  numbers  would  face  him. 

Pandarus,  brave  Lycaon's  son,  indignant  beheld  him 
Driving  before  him  the  Trojan  ranks,  in  rout  and  disorder. 
Straightway  his  bow  he  drew,  as  the  chief  rushed  on,  and  the  arrow 
Sped  to  its  mark  dire 61,  and  the  brazen  plate  of  the  corslet 
On  his  right  shoulder  struck.     Through  the  plate  it  went,  and   be- 
neath it 
Pierced  to  the  bone;  and  the  blood  gushed  forth  and  streamed  o'er 
the  corslet.  [I0°] 

Pandarus  shouted  aloud,  and  exulting  called  to  the  Trojans  :  (100) 
''Forward!    Heroes    of    Troy.     Goad    on    your    steeds    to    the 
combat, 
Slain  is  the  bravest  Greek :  for  that  stout  shaft  which  I  sent  him 
Surely  he  cannot  survive;  or  in  vain  from  my  Lycian  city 
Phoebus,  the  son  of  Zeus,  will  have  sent  me  hither  to  aid  you." 

Vauntingly  thus  he  spake.     But  the  shaft  had  failed  of  its  purpose. 
Back  for  a  space  the  chief  withdrew,  and  in  front  of  the  horses 
Standing,  Sthenelus  thus,  great  Capaneus'  son,  he  accosted  : 

"  Sthenelus !  give  me  thine  aid,  my  friend.  Dismount  from  the  chariot ; 

Lend  thine  hand,  and  extract  this  bitter  dart  from  my  shoulder." 

Thus   he   spake.     Then   Sthenelus    sprang    from    the   car;    and, 

alighted,  (no)  =  [in] 

Stood  by  his  chief,  and  the  deep-fixed  shaft  plucked  forth  from  his 

shoulder. 
Straightway  the  blood  gushed  forth  in  a  stream  through  the  mail  of 
the  corslet. 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  91 

While  the  brave  hero  prayed  aloud  to  Pallas  Athene  : 

"Daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Zeus,  invincible!  hear  me.  [IX5] 

If  to  my  father  e'er  thou  hast  giv'n  thine  aid  and  protection 
In  the  dire  straits  of  Avar :  to  his  son,  great  Goddess !  extend  them, 
Now  in  his  utmost  need.     Oh !    bring  within  range  of  my  jav'lin — 
Grant  me  to  slay — this  cowardly  vaunter,  who  from  a  distance 
Out  of  my  reach,  unawares,  at  my  life  hath  aimed,  and  who  boasts  him, 
Fool  that  he  is ,  that  the  sun  shall  rise  no  more  on  Tydeides."  (120) 

Earnestly  thus  he  prayed — and  his  prayer  reached  Pallas  Athene  ; 
All  his  strength  she  renewed,  and  lightened  each  limber  the  combat; 
Standing  beside  him  then  with  inspiring  words  she  addressed  him  : 

"Now,  Diomedes  be  bold!  Renew  thy  assault  on  the  Trojans. 
All  thy  intrepid  father's  fire  have  I  kindled  within  thee,  (I25) 

Such,  as  when  shaking  his  blazing  shield,  he  mounted  his  chariot. 
Purged  henceforth  be  the  sight  of  thine  eyes  from  the  mist  that  ob- 
scured it: 
Gods  shalt  thou  now  discern  from  men,  when  perchance  thou  shalt 

meet  them 
Mingled  with  either  host,  and  lending  their  aid  to  the  zuarriors. 
These  when  thousee'st,  thy  rage  control,  and  forbear  to  assail  them.  (130) 
Strike  at  all  else.     But  should  fair  Aphrodite  mix  in  the  struggle, 
Daughter  of  Zeus  though  she  be,  let  her  feel  the  point  of  thy  weapon." 

Soon  as  these  words  were  said,  from  his  side  Athena  departed; 
While  once  more  to  the  front  of  the  battle  flew  Diomedes. 
Keen  if  before  he  had  been,  and  eager  to  fight  with  the  Trojans, 
Now  with  a  threefold  force  did  his  ardour  burn.     As  a  lion 
Whom,  o'erleaping  the  fold,  some  shepherd  hath  grazed  with  an  arrow, 
Grazed,  but  not  hurt,  when  his  fleecy  charge  he  pens  in  the  pasture. 
This  but  the  more  inflames  his  rage.    Then  flies  their  protector, 
Hiding  himself  in  the  stalls,  while  in  terror  they  huddle  together,    (140) 
Heaps  upon  heaps,  and  bleeding  sink,  while  he  revels  in  carnage. 
Sated  at  length  and  exulting,  he  bounds  o'er  the  fence  to  his  forest. 
Thus  Diomedes  mixed  with  the  Trojan  host,  and  consumed  them. 

Then  were  Astynoiis  slain,  and  Hypeiron,  a  prince  of  the  people, 
One  through  the  breast  he  pierced,  above  the  pap,  with  his  jav'lin; 
Next  with  his  mighty  sword  the  shoulder  and  arm  of  the  other, 


92  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Just  where  the  bones  unite,  from  the  neck  and  back  he  divided. 
Leaving  them  dead,  on  Abas  he  rushed  and  brave  Polyeides, 
Sons  of  Eurydamas  old,  that  sage  expounder  of  visions. 
Vision  was  none  vouchsafed  him  to  tell  their  fate:  by  Tydeides  (150) 
Destined  together  to  fall,  and  resign  their  spoils  to  the  victor. 

Xanthus  and  Thoon,  Phcenops'  sons,  were  the  next  he  encountered, 
Dearly  belov'd,  and  the  only  joy  of  their  age-stricken  parent. 
Hope  had  he  none  of  other  sons  his  wealth  to  inherit — • 
Both  by  Tydeides'  arm  were  of  life  bereft;  and  their  father 
Left  in  his  grief  and  despair  to  mourn  der  the  loss  of  his  children. 
Ne'er  shall  he  more  receive  them  with  glory  returning  from  battle ! 
Nought  remains  but  to  die,  and  to  leave  his  possessions  to  strangers. 

Chromios  then  and  Echaemon,  sons  of  Dardanian  Priam, 
Both  in  one  chariot  borne  he  grappling  seized — as  a  lion         (160) 
Bounding  forth  from  his  forest  lair  on  some  pasturing  heifer 
Breaks  its  strong  neck  and  crushes  it  down.     Thus  vainly  resisting, 
Struggling  with  impotent  force,  he  tore  them  both  from  their  chariot, 
Hurling  theni  prone  to  the  earth;  and  stript  their  arms;  while  their 

horses, 
Duly  consigned  to  his  comrades'  care,  he  despatched  to  the  vessels. 

Him  when  yEneas  beheld  thus  wasting  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
Swift  through  their  host  he  sped,  through  the  clash  of  spears  and  the 

battle, 
Pandarus  seeking,  Lycaon's  son,  if  perchance  he  might  find  him. 
Soon  he  perceived  where  stood  that  brave  and  godlike  commander, 
Whom,  in  his  presence  arrived,  with  words  like  these  he  exhorted:  (170) 

"  Pandarus !  where  is  thy  bow?  Where  now  thy  death-winged  arrows? 
Where  thy  unrivalled  skill?     Is  there  here  one  man  of  the  Trojans, 
Aye,  or  in  Lycia's  realm  can  one  be  found,  to  surpass  thee? 
Come  now !  send  him  a  shaft !   this  man  who  lords  it  among  us 
Working  us  all  this  ruin,  and  heaping  the  ground  with  our  heroes 
Many  and  brave.     But  first  unto  Zeus  prefer  thy  petition, 
Lest  that  perchance  some  God  this  be  with  the  Trojans  offended 
For  some  neglected  rite,  who  wreaks  such  vengeance  upon  us." 

Then  in  his  turn  replied  the  valiant  son  of  Lycaon : 
" Noble  yEneas,  distinguished  alike  in  fight  and  in  council!      (180) 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  93 

This,  if  each  mark  deceive  me  not,  is  the  brave  Diomedes. 
Well  do  I  know  the  blaze  of  his  shield  and  his  towering  helmet  ; 
Those  are  his  steeds.     Yet  a  God  it  indeed  may  be  in  his  likeness. 
But  if  a  man,  and  the  man  I  name,  Diomedes  in  person, 
Then  be  thou  sure  some  God  stands  nigh,  cloud-veiled,  to  inspire  him, 
Urging  him  on  to  deeds  of  frantic  and  desperate  daring ; 
Blunting,  or  turning  aside  the  shaft  full  aimed  at  his  bosom. 
'Twas  but  this  moment  a  dart  I  sped,  which  full  on  his  shoulder 
Lighted,  forcing  its  way  through  the  stiff-wrought  plate  of  his  corslet. 
Surely  I  then  would  have  sworn  that  to  Hell's  deep  shades  I  had  sent 

him.  i1^) 

There,  however,  unharmed  he  stands.     Some  God  must  be  angry! 
Horses  here  have  I  none,  nor  chariot  to  bear  me  to  combat. 
Chariots  eleven  stand  in  the  halls  of  my  father  Lycaon, 
Handsome  and  new,  fresh  plated  and  wrought,  and  each  with  its  mantle 
Shrouded  around;  and  beside  them,  in  pairs,  stand  ready  for  harness 
Idle  steeds,  who  consume  white  spelt,  and  fatten  on  barley. 
Much  did  my  sire  exhort  me,  that  aged  warrior  Lycaon, 
Ere  I  to  war  set  forth, — in  the  regal  halls  of  his  palace, — 
Forth  with  chariot  and  horses  to  fare,  mid  lead  on  the  Trojans 
Mounted,  and   borne   on  high  in   my  car  through  the  rage  of  the 

combat.  (200) 

Would  I  had  ta'en  his  advice — for  that  I  perceive  had  been  wiser. 
There  however  I  left  them,  and  marched  with  the  footmen  to  Ilion. 
Thinking  to  spare  my  coursers,  and  dreading  the  cost  of  their  forage 
Likely  to  fail  in  a  city  so  thronged  : — (they,  accustomed  to  plenty). 
So  to  my  bow  I  trusted,  and  feebly  indeed  has  it  served  me. 
Two,  their  bravest  and  best,  have  felt  my  shafts.     Menelaiis 
First  I  struck — then  Tydeus'  son;  and  blood  undissembled 
Streamed  from  them  both.     In  vain!  for  their  wounds  but  served  to 

enrage  them. 
Luckless  indeed  was  the  day  when  I  took  my  bow  a?id  my  quiver 
Down  from  the  peg  where  they  idly  hung  and  to  Ilion  bore  them,  (210) 
Leading  the  troops  of  Troy,  in  the  cause  of  glorious  Hector. 
Sure  as  I  ever  again  set  eyes  on  my  wife  and  my  country, 
Sure  as  once  more  I  behold  that  grand  old  house  of  my  fathers, 


94  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

So  may  some  stranger's  hand  strike  off  this  head  from  my  shoulders, 
Break  I  not  up  this  worthless  toy,  this  bow,  and  these  arrows, 
Fit  for  nought  else  but  to  feed  the  flames ;  where  then  I  shall  cast 
them. 

Thus  then  ^Eneas  replied,  the  warlike  chief  of  the  Trojans  : 
" Cease  this  needless  harangue!     Let  us  both  unite  to  attack  him. 
This  is  our  only  course.     Nought  else  will  avail.     In  the  chariot 
Shield  against  shield,  and   lance  against  lance,  let  us  meet  him  in 
combat :  (220) 

Mount  then  at  once,  and  mark  how  bravely  my  coursers  will  bear  us, 
Sweeping  across  the  plain,  now  here,  now  there,  now  advancing, 
Fierce  to  the  charge — now  swift  in  pursuit — now  haply  retreating. 
Should  the  decrees  of  Zeus  give  conquest  and  fame  to  Tydeides, 
These,  in  the  worst  event,  will  secure  our  return  to  the  city. 
Take  thou  the  whip  and  the  varnished  reins.     Myself  o'er  the  horses, 
Planted  in  front,  will  receive  his  assault :  or  do  thou,  if  it  please  thee, 
Face  him  with  spear  and  shield,  and  mine  be  the  care  of  the  chariot." 

Thus  then  in  turn  replied  the  valiant  son  of  Lycaon : 
"Take  thou   the  reins,  ^Eneas,  and   guide   thy  steeds.     They   will 
bear  us  (23°) 

Better,  beneath  a  hand  they  know,  in  thy  car,  to  the  combat : 
Or,  should  the  foe  prevail,  retreat  more  safely  and  swiftly. 
Missing  thy  well  known  voice  and  thy  touch,  in  some  perilous  moment 
Restive,  they  might  refuse  the  rein,  and  entangle  the  chariot : 
So  should  we  fall  a  prey  to  Tydeides'  lance,  and  the  victor 
(One  and  the  other  being  slain)  drive  off  thy  coursers  in  triumph. 
Look  thou  then  to  the  steeds  and  the  car,  while  I  with  my  jav'lin 
Pointed  and  keen,  advanced,  confront  this  scourge  of  our  armies." 

Thus  resolved,  they  desisted  from  words,  and,  mounting  the  chariot, 
Down  on  Tydeides  bore  at  the  utmost  speed  of  their  horses.  (240) 
Sthenelus  then,  brave  Capaneus'  son,  who  beheld  them  advancing, 
Promptly  these  warning  words  addressed  to  his  chief  Diomedes  : 
"Friend  of  my  heart,  belov'd  and  revered,  great  Tydeus'  offspring! 
Lo!  where  two  mighty  chiefs  approach,  both  eager  to  slay  thee, 
Both  of  transcendent  force.     The  first  I  know  for  the  archer 
Pandarus,  proud  of  his  birth  as  heir  of  royal  Lycaon: 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  95 

With  him  ^Eneas  comes,  brave  son  of  the  pious  Anchises, 
Claiming  a  loftier  descent  as  the  child  of  bright  Aphrodite. 
Therefore  in  time  retire.     Come!  mount  thy  car,  and  no  longer 
Headlong  rush  through  the  fight,  where  death  and  destruction  await 
thee."  (250) 

Bending  upon  him  a  scornful  frown,  thus  spake  Diomedes  : 
''Talk  not  of  fear  or  flight  to  me  :  such  counsel  is  wasted. 
'Tis  not  for  hearts  like  mine  to  skulk  or  shudder  at  danger, 
Nor  is  my  strength  subdued,  or  nerves  unstrung  for  the  combat. 
Shameful  I  hold  it  to  mount  yon  car.     On  foot  will  I  meet  them, 
Here  as  I  stand :  for  Pallas  Athena  forbids  me  to  tremble. 
Both  these  warriors  'scape  not  hence  by  the  speed  of  their  horses. 
One  by  this  hand  shall  fall,  though  the  other  to  flight  may  betake  him. 
But  should  the  wise  decrees  and  the  powerful  aid  of  Athene' 
Give  me  the  glory  to  slay  them  both,  then,  list  what  I  tell  thee  :  (260) 
Bear  it  in  mind.     Detain  these  steeds  which  hither  have  borne  thee, 
Fast'ning  the  reins  to  the  rim  of  the  car.     Then  lose  not  a  7noment, 
Spring  to  JEneas'  place,  and,  seizing  the  reins  of  his  horses, 
Drive  them  at  once  from  the  Trojan  host  to  the  camp  of  the  Grecians. 
They  from  celestial  sires  their  race  derive,  which  the  Thund'rer 
Gave  as  a  prize  to  Tros  for  the  loss  of  his  son  Ganymedes. 
None  that  the  circling  sun  beholds  can  match  them  in  fleetness. 
Stol'n  was  the  breed  through  earthly  mares,  by  royal  Anchises 
Furtively  brought  to  Laomedon's  stalls.     Six  colts  were  the  produce, 
Foaled  in  Anchises' palace,  and  nursed  with  care:  who,  retaining  (270) 
Four  for  himself,  this  matchless  pair  bestowed  on  ^Eneas ; 
Trained  from  their  birth  to  war,  and  inured  to  the  terrors  of  battle. 
These  could  we  capture,  rich  were  the  spoil,  far  richer  the  glory." 

Thus  while  the  two  communed,  and  the  Prince  stood  ready  for  acliou, 
On  came  rattling  in  full  career  the  car  of  his  foemen. 
Nearing  him,  thus  then  spake  the  redoubted  son  of  Lycaon  : 

"Brave  as  thou  art,  great  Tydeus'  son,  prepare  to  defend  thee! 
What  though  my  keen  and  biting  shaft  once  failed  of  its  purpose, 
Sharper  and  surer  now  shaft  thou  find  the  point  of  my  jav'lin."    (279) 

Ceasing,  his  long-forth-shadowing  spear  he  hurled :  and  the  weapon 
Full  on  Tydeides'  shield  struck  sharp,  and  straight  through  the  buckler 


96  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Forc'd  its  impetuous  way,  till  its  point  just  short  of  the  corslet 
Reached ;  and  exulting  shouted  aloud  the  son  of  Lycaon  : 

"Now  thou  art  slain  outright !  Thy  flank  is  pierced,  and  the  moments 
Numbered  thou  hast  to  live!    And  mine  is  the  triumph  and  glory." 

Undismayed,  Diomedes  then  this  answer  returned  him: 
"  This  time  too  thou  hast  failed.     Unhurt  I  stand.     But  expect  not, 
Living,  ye  both  shall  quit  this  field.     Hurled  down  from  your  chariot, 
One  or  the  other  shall  glut  with  his  blood  insatiate  Ares." 

Ending,  he  darted  aloft  his  spear,  which  Athena  directed     (290) 
Full  upon  Pandarus'  face,  'twixt  the  nose  and  eye :  and  the  weapon 
Crashed  through  his  ivory  teeth  and  clave  his  tongue,  and  descending 
Stood  forth,  gleaming  and  bright,  from  beneath  his  chin.     And   he 

tumbled 
Headlong  down  from  the  car,  and  his  bright  arms  rattled  around  him. 
Started  aside  with  nnwotited  fear  those  swift-footed  coursers ; 
While,  as  he  lay,  his  strength  ebbed  forth  and  his  spirit  forsook  him. 

Swift  from  the  car  ^Eneas  sprang,  with  spear  and  with  buckler, 
Eager  to  guard  the  dead,  lest  the  Greeks  should  seize  and  despoil  him. 
Round  him  he  stalked  in  his  might,  like  a  lion  defending  his  quarry; 
O'er  him  his  dreadful  spear  and  his  shield's  vast  shadow  extending  (300) 
Ready  to  slay  whoe'er  might  advance ;  right  fearfully  shouting. 
Then  Diomedes  a  huge  rough  stone  upheaved.     But  to  raise  it 
Two  strong  men,  such  as  men  now  are,  would  be  tasked.     Yet  he 

swung  it 
Easily  round,  the  enormous  mass!     Then  full  at  ./Eneas 
Hurled  it  amain.     On  his  hip  it  fell;  just  there  where  the  thigh-bone 
Plays,  at  the  hip,  in  its  socket-joint  (so  called):    and  it  lighted, 
Crushing  the  joint,  and  rending  the  strong-knit  sinews  asunder, 
Stripping  the  skin  with  its  rugged  points.     Down  sinking  in  anguish 
Knelt  he;  his  hand  on  the  ground  sustained:  and  the  Sittings  of 

darkness 
Gathered  before  his  reeling  sight,  as  his  senses  forsook  him.      (310) 

Then  for  ever  had  closed  the  gates  of  death  on  ^Eneas, 
Had  not  bright  Aphrodite,  with  watchful  care  for  the  offspring 
Whom  to  Anchises  she  bore,  when  his  herds  were  ranging  on  Ida, 
Seen  his  distress.     Her  belov'd  in  her  snow-white  arms  she  enfolded, 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  97 

Wrapping  around  him  her  shining  veil  to  conceal  and  protect  him. 
Lest  in  the  rush  of  the  Danaan  horse  and  storm  of  the  jav'lins 
Some  stray  weapon  his  heart  should  pierce,  and  cut  short  his  existence. 

Stealthily  thus  Aphrodite'  conveyed  her  son  from  the  battle. 
Capaneus'  son  meanwhile,  his  lord's  injunction  rememb'ring — 
That  strict  charge  so  lately  received  from  brave  Diomedes —  (320) 
First,  aside  from  the  tumult  his  own  good  steeds  and  his  chariot 
Drew,  and  the  reins  made  fast  to  the  rim :  then,  quickly  returning, 
Seized  and  guided  the  long-maned  steeds  and  the  car  of  -.-Eneas 
Forth  from  the  Trojan  host  to  the  bright  array  of  the  Grecians  : 
These  to  Deipylus  gave,  his  own  true  friend  and  companion, 
One  like  himself  in  heart,  whom  most  he  trusted  and  honoured, 
Bidding  him  drive  them  away  to  the  ships.     And  now  to  his  chariot 
Springing,  the  whip  and  the  varnished  reins  he  seized,  and  the  horses 
Swift  o'er  the  plain  with  thund'ring  hoofs  sought  out  Diomedes. 
He  meanwhile  with  relentless  spear  pursued  Aphrodite';  (33°) 

Well  did  he  know  how  weak  her  force  in  the  combats  of  heroes, 
Unlike  those  dread  Pow'rs  who  sway  the  wild  tempest  (/"battle, 
Pallas  with  jEgis  and  spear,  or  the  dire,  wide-wasting  Enyo. 
Her  through  crowded  ranks,  through  the  clash  of  arms  and  the  tumult, 
Tydeus'  son  pursued,  and  with  lance  outstretched  overtook  her. 
Then  with  a  bound  rushed  on,  and  her  soft  hand  pierced  with  his 

weapon. 
Through  the  ambrosial  veil  it  passed,  which  the  Graces  had  woven, 
Razing  her  snow-white  skin  where  the  palm  to  the  wrist  is  united. 
Streamed  forth  at  once  from  the  wound  the  pure  rich  blood  of  the 

goddess, 
Ichor,  such  as  celestial  veins  may  pour.     For  th"  immortals    (340) 
Bread  neither  eat,  ner  drink  they  the  dark  red  wine.     And  we  deem 

them 
Bloodless,  therefore,  undying,  and  freed  from  decay  or  corruption. 
Wounded,  however,  a  piercing  shriek  sent  forth  Aphrodite. 
Casting  her  son  from  her  arms.     Him  rescued  Phcebus  Apollo, 
Safe  in  a  cloud  involved,  and  bore,  unseen  by  the  Grecians, 
So  that  no  weapon  his  breast  might  pierce  and  cut  short  his  existence, 
While  in  a  thundering  voice  thus  spake  incensed  Diomedes : 


98  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

"Daughter  of  Zeus!  retire  from  scenes  of  blood  and  contention, 
Go!  and  beguile  weak  women — a  part  which  better  befits  thee. 
Well  do  I  deem,  if  in  battles  thou  mix,  fresh  terrors  await  thee    (350) 
Such  as  henceforth  at  the  name  of  war  shall  teach  thee  to  shudder." 

Ended  the  chief.    Confused  and  o'erwhelmed  the  goddess  departed, 
Iris  the  swift  sustaining  and  leading  her  forth  from  the  tumult, 
Fainting  with  pain:  her  lovely  cheek  all  livid  with  terror. 
Ares  she  found,  on  the  left  of  the  field,  withdrawn  from  the  battle, 
Seated:  his  horses  and  arms  in  mist  involved  and  in  darkness. 
Low  at  his  knee  to  her  brother  she  bent,  and  besought  that  his  chariot 
Bright,  and  his  gold-reined  steeds  he  would  lend,  to  Olympus  to  bear 
her: 

"Dearest  brother  !     Grant  me  a  kindness.     Lend  me  thy  horses 
Back  to  Olympus  to  bear  me,  the  home  of  the  blessed  Immortals,  (360) 
See  !  what  a  wound  I  bear,  by  the  hand  of  a  mortal  inflicted, 
Tydeus'  son,  who  would  strike  out  at  Father  Zeus  in  his  madness" 

Thus  she  spake.     And  Ares  the  gold-bitted  horses  accorded, 
Sad  was  her  heart  and  faint  her  step  as  she  mounted  the  chariot : 
Iris  beside  her  grasped  the  reins,  and  guided  the  horses, 
Lashing  them  on,  and  they  flew  with  right  good  will  on  their  journey. 
Soon  to  Olympus  they  came,  high  home  of  the  blessed  immortals. 
There  they  alighted,  and  Iris  the  swift,  unyoking  the  coursers, 
Led  them  away  to  their  stalls,  and  fed  with  ambrosial  fodder. 

Then  on  her  mother  Dione's  knees  divine  Aphrodite  (37°) 

Flung  herself,  drowned  in  tears.     She  fondly  embracing  her  daughter, 
Soothed  with  caressing  hand,  and  endearingly  naming,  bespoke  her : 

"Which  of  the  Pow'rs,  my  child,  so  foul  an  outrage  hath  wrought 
thee, 
Ruthless,  as  if  in  revenge  for  some  wrong  openly  done  him?" 

Then  complamingly  answered  the  goddess  of  smiles,  Aphrodite : 
"Wounded  thou  see'st  me  by  Tydeus'  insolent  son  Diomedes, 
As  from  the  flight  I  bore  my  darling  son,  my  ^Eneas, 
Grievously  hurt:  for  dearly  beyond  all  others  I  love  him. 
This  is  no  war  of  Greek  against  Trojan.     Daring  and  impious, 
Lo!  they  assail  th'  immortal  Gods,  and  contend  with  Olympus."    (380) 

Calm  and  serene,  to  her  daughter's  plaint  Dione  responded : 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  99 

"  Patience,  my  child !  whate'er  thy  griefs.      Complaining  is  useless. 
Woes  and  affronts  from  the  sons  of  men  too  oft  have  we  suffered, 
Dwellers  albeit  on  high.     They,  in  turn,  by  the  gods  are  afflicted. 
Ares  himself,  held  bound  by  Otus  and  stern  Ephialtes, 
Strong  Aloaeus'  sons,  lay  groaning  in  fetters  and  darkness. 
Thirteen  moons,  immured  in  a  brass-barred  dungeon  they  held  him. 
There  well-nigh  had  he  groaned  forth  his  soul ;  but  fair  Eribcea, 
Consort  of  Zeus,  his  woes  beheld,  and  came  to  his  rescue. 
Hermes  she  sent,  who  with  dext'rous  craft  deceiving  his  gaolers  (390) 
Carried  him  off,  more  dead  than  alive :  for  the  chain  had  subdued  him. 
Deep  was  the  wound  and  fierce  the  pangs  which  imperial  Hera 
Felt,  from  a  shaft  thrice  barbed,  and  drenched  with  the  venom  of  Lema, 
In  her  right  breast  infixed  by  the  hand  of  the  son  of  Amphitryon. 
Wing'd  by  the  selfsame  hand,  such  a  shaft  the  rude  bosom  of  Hades 
Pierced,  in  his  own  dark  halls  of  the  dead,  in  the  gate  of  his  palace, 
High    071   his  throne  where  he  sat  supreme,    and    plunged    him    in 

torments. 
Up  to  the  light  at  once,  to  the  dwellings  of  Zeus  in  Olympus, 
Groaning  with  anguish  he  came  (the  shaft  still  rankling  and  rooted 
Deep  in  his  iron  shoulder),  beseeching  Apollo  to  aid  him.  (400) 

Pason  with  healing  balms  his  pains  assuaged,  and  restored  him 
Whole  as  before :  for  nought  that  could  die  pertained  to  his  nature. 
"Rude  and  presumptuous  man!  could  nought  restrain  thee  from 

outrage, 
Nought  withhold  thy  arms  from  assailing  the  pow'rs  of  Olympus? 
(Pallas  alone,  my  child,  could  have  urged  him  thus  to  assault  thee.) 
Knows  he  not,  blind  as  he  is,  that  whoe'er  with  the  blessed  immortals 
Measures  his  feeble  strength,  his  date  of  existence  is  shortened  ? 
Him  no  lisping  welcome  awaits,  returning  from  warfare; 
Climbing  a  father's  knees,  no  fond  group  gathers  around  him. 
Let  him  beware,  this  Tydeus'  son,  lest  a  mightier  than  thou  art,  (410) 
Brave  though  he  be,  cut  short  his  career,  and  confound  his  presumption. 
Now,,  even  now,  methinks  I  hear  the  shrieks  of  his  consort 
Starting  from  broken  slumbers,  and  rousing  her  faithful  attendants, 
Wild  with  despair  and  grief,  and  filling  her  palace  with  outcries, 
Calling  on  him  she  shall  see  no  more,  her  lost  Diomedes."

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 


Thus  she  spake,  and  wiped  the  blood  from  the  hand  of  her  daughter. 
Healed  was  the  wound,  and  assuaged  the  pain.    But  Athena  and  Here, 
Standing  together  apart,  looked  on  disdainfully  smiling, 
Angering  Zeus  with  their  whispered  taunts  and  sarcastic  reflections. 
Pallas  at  length  outspake,  and  in  words  like  these  she  addressed 
him :  (420) 

"Father  supreme!  may  I  speak,  nor  dread  by  my  words  to  offend 
thee? 
Cypris,  methinks,  has  been  tempting  some  Grecian  dame,  and  beguiled 

her 
One  of  her  Trojan  fav'rites  to  follow:  (so  dearly  she  loves  them!) 
Doubtless  she  then,  while  smoothing  her  robes  and  sweetly  caressing, 
Wounded  that  delicate  hand  with  the  golden  clasp  of  her  girdle." 

Thus  as  she  spake,  with  a  smile  the  Father  of  Gods  and  of  mortals, 
Bright  Aphrodite  called  to  his  side,  and  thus  he  addressed  her: 
"Thee  it  befits  not,  my  child,  to  mix  in  the  horrors  of  battle, 
Rather  be  thine  the  care  to  unite  fond  lovers  in  marriage; 
Leaving  the  ruder  tasks  of  war  to  Athena  and  Ares."  (43°) 

Such  were  the  scenes  that  passed,  and  such  the  discourse  in  Olympus. 
While  Diomedes  rushed  with  resounding  shouts  on  yEneas. 
Nought  recked  he  (though  he  knew  full  well  that  Phoebus  Apollo 
O'er  him  his  mighty  arm  stretched  forth  to  protect),  in  his  fury 
Panting  for  slaughter,  and  longing  to  strip  the  spoils  of  his  foeman, 
Forward  thrice  did  he  rush,  in  headlong  charge,  on  ^Eneas ; 
Thrice  dashed  back  was  his  blazing  shield  by  the  hand  of  Apollo. 
But  when  his  wond'rous  strength  for  a  fourth  assault  he  collected, 
Dread   was   the  menace,  stern   the  rebuke   which   broke   from   the 
Godhead  ! 

"Tydeus'  son,  be  wise!  Retire!  nor  dream  with  immortals  (440) 
Earth-born  force  to  compare.  Too  wide  is  the  space  that  divides  thee, 
Creature  of  dust!  from  the  deathless  race  that  rules  in  Olympus." 

Thus  he  spake.     And  Tydeides  a  few  short  paces  receded, 
Dreading  to  meet  the  wrath  of  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo : 
Phoebus,  the  while,  the  fainting  chief  from  the  crowd  and  the  conflict 
Bore  to  his  own  high  fane  in  the  sacred  city  of  Priam. 
There  in  that  mighty  shrine,  by  Leto  and  Artemis  tended, 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  101 

Healed  were  his  wounds,  and  he  stood  restored  in  strength,  and  in  glory. 

Then  by  the  God  of  the  silver  bow  was  a  phantom  created, 
Like  to  ^Eneas  in  size,  i?i  form,  in  feature,  and  armour.  (45°) 

Over  the  shadowy  form  and  around  it  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans, 
Bosom  to  bosom,  and  foot  to  foot,  confronted  and  struggling, 
Clashed  the  broad  orbs  of  their  shields,  and  the  light  defence  of  their 
targets. 

Phoebus,  the  furious  god  of  war  then  sought,  and  addressed  him  : 
"Ares!  Ares,  bloodstained!  destroyer!  o'erturner  of  ramparts! 
Wilt  thou  not  meet  this  insolent  man  and  away  from  the  battle 
Tear  him  by  force?  who  would  fight  with  our  Father  Zeus  in  his  madness. 
Cypris  he  first  assailed,  and  pierced  her  hand  with  his  javlin, 
Then  on  myself  he  rushed,  with  might  scarce  less  than  immortal." 
Thus  having  said,  for  Pergamus'  lofty  seats  he  departed.  (460) 

Ares  fierce,  meanwhile  went  rousing  the  host  of  the  Trojans 
All  through  their  ranks,  like  Acamas  swift,  the  chief  of  the  Thracians, 
Thus  bespeaking  the  sons  of  Priam,  the  favour'd  of  heaven  : 

"Son  of  the  glorious  Priam — that  prince  the  favour'd  of  heaven, 
Say!    How  long  will  ye  suffer  the  Greeks  to  slaughter  your  armies? 
Up  to  your  very  gates  shall  the  carnage  spread?     And  ALneas, 
Mighty  Anchises'  son,  great  Hector's  equal  in  glory, 
Here  will  ye  leave,  struck  down  and  trampled,  a  prey  to  the  spoiler  1 
Forward!    Bear  we  his  honoured  remains  away  from  the  tumult." 

Then  with  a  martial  zeal  was  each  Troian  bosom  dilated.  (47°) 

Then  by  Sarpedon  words  of  reproof  unto  Hector  were  spoken  : 
"Hector:  where  is  thy  valour,  thy  wonted  prowess  in  battle? 
Didst  thou  not  boast  that,  alone  and  unaided,  thou  and  thy  brethren, 
Kithe  and  kin,  would  the  city  defend,  nor  need  our  assistance ? 
Now  not  a  man  can  mine  eyes  discern  of  your  vaunted  relations. 
Crouching  afar,  like  dogs  they  cow'r  when  the  lion  is  rampant. 
While,  when  it  comes  to  fighting,  'tis  we,  your  allies,  who  must  combat. 
Hither,  in  aid  of  your  cause,  have  I  brought  my  Lycian  squadrons, 
Summoned  from  realms  remote,  from  the  banks  of  eddying  Xanthus, 
Leaving  behind  my  dear-loved  wife  with  her  babe  at  her  bosom.  (480) 
Leaving  my  rich  possessions,  the  envy  of  all  who  behold  them. 
Here,  however,  thou  see'st  me,  my  Lycians  heading  and  ready 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 


E'en  with  that  man  to  fight,  though  my  stake  is  nought  in  your  quarrel: 
Nought  have  I  here,  to  swell  the  spoils  of  the  conquering  Grecians. 
And  canst  thou  here  inactive  stand,  nor  exhort  thy  companions 
Bravely   to   hold  their  ground,  and   protect   their   wives   and   their 

children  ? 
Look  to  it  now!  lest  around  you  they  tighten  their  toils,  and  like 

hunters 
Closing  upon  their  prey,  make  an  easy  prize  of  your  weakness, 
Whelming  your  city  and  all  it  holds  in  destruction  and  ruin. 
This  be  thy  daily  care  and  thy  nightly  thought :  to  encourage      (490) 
All  your  friends  and  allies,  by  example  and  earnest  entreaty, 
Bravely  to  persevere  and  dismiss  all  rival  pretensions." 

Thus  Sarpedon  :  and  bitterly  fell  the  reproof  upon  Hector. 
Down  to  the  earth  at  once  he  sprang,  full  armed  from  his  chariot, 
Brandishing  two  sharp  spears:  and  he  passed  through  the  ranks  of 

the  Trojans, 
Rousing  their  courage  afresh,  and  filling  their  bosoms  with  ardour. 
Quickly  they  formed  once  more  inline,  and  advanced  on  the  Grecians. 
They,  on  their  part  with  unshaken  front,  awaited  the  onset. 

As  when  the  winnowing  winds  from  the  sacred  floor  of  the  thresher, 
Drift   the  light-whirling  chaff  by  the  labouring   hind   toss't  heav'n- 

wards,  (5°°) 

While  from  the  golden  grain  Demeter  the  husk  is  dividing, 
Heaps  upon  heaps  it  whitens  around: — on  the  helms  &lt;?/*the  Grecians, 
Thus,  and  their  glitf  ring  arms,  white  settled  the  dust,  that  on  all  sides 
Rose  to  the  tramp  of  steeds,  and  the  chariot-wheels,  and  in  eddies 
Rolled  'neath  the  brazen  vault  of  Heav'n.  Back  rushed  they  to  battle, 
Pushing  amain;   straight  on.     Fierce  Ares,  aiding  the  Trojans, 
Thickened  the  gloom,  and  veiled  with  a  death-like  shadow  the  combat. 
All  through  their  host  he  went,  and  fulfilled  the  commission  of  Phoebus, 
Lord  of  the  golden  sword,  to  inflame  their  rage  and  excite  them, 
Boldly  to  charge  on  the  foe;  for  now,  withdrawn  from  the  contest,  (510) 
Pallas  Athena  no  more  he  beheld  supporting  the  Grecians. 

Phoebus  himself  meanwhile,  from  his  gorgeous  shrine  in  the  city, 
Sent  forth  ^Eneas,  valour  infusing  and  might  in  his  bosom. 
Shouted  his  brave  companions  in  arms  to  receive  him  among  them, 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  103 

Him,  their  Prince,  their  leader  in  fight — in  life,  and  in  safety- 
Whole,  and  strong  as  before.    Unquestioned  however  he  joined  them. 
Other  and  sterner  work  discourse  forbade ;  by  Apollo, 
Ares,  scourge  of  mankind,  and  insatiate  Eris,  appointed. 

Then  did  each  Aias,  then  did  Odysseus  and  brave  Diomedes, 
Cheer  on  their  Greeks  to  the  fight.     They,  indeed,  recked  nought 
of  the  Trojans,  (52°) 

Holding  i7i  equal  scorn  their  assault,  and  their  boisterous  outcry. 
Fixed  they  remained,  like  clouds  which  around  the  crest  of  a  mountain 
Motionless  hang,  while  Boreas  sleeps;  by  the  word  of  Kronion 
Hushed  into  calm;   and  the   shrill-voiced  blasts  that  would  scatter 

their  shadows, 
Drifting  them  far  and  wide  o'er  the  plain,  lie  sunk  into  silence : 
Brooding,  i7i  solemn  array,  they  expect  the  awakening  tempest: 
Thus  stood  the  Greeks,  expe cling  the  Trojan  attack.     But  Atreides 
Hast'ning  from  rank  to  rank  to  the  troops  thus  issued  his  orders : 

"Now,  my  friends!  be  men.     Keep  up  your  hearts  in  the  struggle, 
Strive  to  out-do  each  other,  and  each  be  to  each  an  example.       (53°) 
Safety  nor  fame  e'er  waits  upon  him  who  flies;  while  the  valiant, 
Nobly  fighting,  secures  his  life  in  the  chances  of  battle." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  swift  at  the  word  forth  darted  his  jav'lin, 
Striking  Deicoon,  Pergasus'  son,  a  chief  of  distinction, 
Comrade  and  friend  of  brave  ^Eneas;  honoured  in  Troia, 
Next  to  the  sons  of  Priam: — for  aye  was  he  eager  in  battle, 
Foremost  to  fight.     Agamemnon's  spear  struck  full  on  the  buckler, 
Pow'rless  to  check  its  force ;  for  it  went  straight  through,  and  his  girdle 
Pierced;  nor  arrested  its  course  till  deep  infixed  in  his  belly :. 
Down  he  fell,  with  a  crash,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him.    (540) 

Then  did  ^Eneas  slay  two  valiant  chiefs  of  the  Grecians, 
Crethon  and  Orsilocheus,  both  sons  of  wealthy  Diodes. 
He,  their  father,  dwelt  in  the  strong-built  city  of  Phere, 
Tracing  his  high  descent  from  the  God  of  the  river  Alphseus, 
In  the  wide-watered  realms  of  the  Pylian  land.     From  Alphaeus 
Sprang  the  first  Orsilocheus,  wide  ruling  many  a  people ; 
Thence,  in  the  next  descent,  the  sceptre  passed  to  Diodes. 
These  were  his  twin-born  sons,  well  train'd  in  the  practice  of  warfare. 


104  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Crethon  and  Orsilocheus,  sent  forth  in  prime  of  their  manhood, 
Who  upon  Ilion's  shore  from  their  sable  ships,  with  the  Argives  (550) 
Landed,  seeking  revenge  for  Atreides  their  king  and  his  brother. 
Honour  to  win  in  the  fields  of  fame  while  fondly  expeclifig, 
Death  cut  short  their  career,  and  o'ershadowed  the  dawn  of  .their  glory. 
As  when  two  mountain  lions  which,  reared  in  the  den  of  their  mother, 
Deep  in  the  tangled  woods,  break  forth  for  ravage  and  slaughter, 
Down  they  rush  on  the  herds  and  the  fatt'ning  sheep  and  the  herdsmen 
Tear  from  their  shelt'ring  stalls;   till  vengeance  is  roused,  and,   o'er- 

mastered, 
Far  from  their  native  woods  they  fall  by  the  spears  of  the  hunters. 
Thus  by  ^Eneas'  hands  these  two  lay  slain  and  extended 
Side  by  side;  like  pines  laid' low  by  the  axe  of  the  woodman.  (560) 

Pitying  their  fall,  Menelaiis,  refulgent  in  glittering  armour, 
Rushed  at  once  to  the  front,  loud  shouting  his  terrible  war-cry, 
Shaking  his  spear  he  advanced ;  urged  on  and  tempted  by  Ares, 
Longing  to  witness  his  fall  by  the  strong  right  hand  of  ^Eneas. 
This  perceiving,  Antilochus,  Nestor's  son,  for  the  issue 
Trembling  (should  great   Menelaiis,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his 

people 
Suffer  defeat,  and  all  be  lost),  rushed  eagerly  forward. 
Close  by  his  leader  and  prince  his. stand  he  took:  as  the  heroes, 
Each  advancing  on  each,  made  ready  for  fight,  and  their  lances 
Poised  in  their  hands,  each  bending  an  angry  scowl  011  the  other.      (570) 
But  when  ^Eneas  beheld  these  two  combined  to  oppose  him, 
Brave  as  he  was,  he  refused  such  odds-,  withdrew  from  the  contest. 
Then. from  the  press  the  dead  they  drew  to  the  ranks  of  the  Grecians, 
Passing  their  sad  remains  to  the  faithful  hands  of  their  comrades, 
Then  to  the  front  returned,,  and  mixed  once  more  in  the  combat. 
Next  fell  Pylsemenes,  chief  of  the  Paphlagonian  warriors, 
Godlike  in  fight,  and  leading  a  noble  band.     Menelaiis, 
Atreus'  warlike  son,  that  spearman  famed,  with  his  jav'lin 
Dealt  him  a  deadly  stroke  where  the  neck  unites  to  the  shoulder. 
Mydon,  Atymnus'  son,  his  brave  and  faithful  attendant,  (580) 

Fell  by  Antilochus'  hand  in  the  act  of  turning  his  horses. 
Struck  by  a  huge  rough  stone  on  the  arm,  from  his  paralysed  fingers 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  105 

Dropped  the  white-ivory-broidered  reins.     As  he  stooped  to  regain  them, 
Forward  Antilochus  sprang,  with  his  sword  deep  gashing  his  temple. 
Headlong  he  pitched  from  the  gorgeous  car,  and  gasped  forth  his  spirit. 
Plunging  he  fell,  and  fixed  in  the  dust,  on  his  head  and  his  shoulders 
Stood  for  a  while,  sustained  by  the  heapy  sand,  till  the  horses, 
Restive  and  trampling,  cast  him  down :  and  Antilochus,  mounting, 
Lashed  them  to  speed,  and  drove  them  swift  to   the  ranks   of  the 
Grecians. 

Hector  beheld,  as  he  looked  through  the  thick ning  fight,  and  upon 
them  (59°) 

Shouting  aloud  he  rushed;  and  the  serried  array  of  the  Trojans 
Followed  their  chief.     With  him  came  Ares  and  dreadful  Envo; 
outrage,  confusion,  unbridled  fury,  attended  the  Goddess. 
Ares  now  before  Hector  advanced,  and  in  front  of  his  onset 
Shook  his  tremendous  spear,  now  stalked  in  his  terrors  behind  him. 

Then  came  a  thrill  of  dread  o'er  the  manly  heart  of  Tydeides. 
Just  as  a  trav'ller,  threading  a  lengthened  maze,  and  uncertain 
"Whither  his  path  may  lead,  unawares  encounters  a  river 
Rolling  to  seaward  in  foam,  and  at  once  his  steps  he  retraces, 
So  drew  back  Diomedes,  and  thus  addressed  his  companions  :     (600) 
"Friends  !  no  wonder  we  view  with  amaze  the  prowess  of  Hector, 
How  like  a  god  he  appears  !  how  brave,  how  noble  in  combat! 
One  of  the  gods  is  ever  at  hand  and  attends  on  his  safety. 
There,  by  his  side,  in  person,  in  form  like  a  man,  I  behold  him. 
Therefore  be  wise.     Retire !     But  keep  your  front  to  the  Trojans ; 
Here  we  cannot  prevail.     'Tis  madness  to  fight  with  th'  immortals." 

Thus  he  spake.     But  the  Troian  host  was  already  upon  them. 
Hector  at  once  two  warriors  slew,  distinguished  for  valour, 
Both  in  one  chariot  borne — Anchialus  brave  and  Menesthes. 
Pitying  their  fate  rushed  forward  the  great  Telamonian  Aias  (610) 
Close  to  the  Trojan  ranks,  and  hurled  his  glittering  weapon. 
Selagus'  son,  Amphius,  it  struck,  whom  Fate  had  conducted 
Far  from  Paesus,  his  native  town;  from  his  lands  and  his  riches 
Aid  to  afford  to  Priam  and  Priam's  sons,  and  to  perish. 
Him  through  the  belt  transfixed  the  great  Telamonian  Aias. 
Deep  in  his  body  was  planted  the  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin. 


106  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Crashing  he  fell:  and  to  seize  his  spoils  illustrious  Aias 
Rushed  on  amain.     But  the  Trojan  spears  came  show'ring  upon  him 
Gleaming  and  sharp,  till  their  bristling  shafts  stood  thick  on  his  buckler. 
Pressing  his  heel  on  the  corpse,  his  brazen  spear  he  recovered.     (620) 
Nought  could  he  more;  for  to  strip  from  its  shoulders  the  glittering 

armour 
Time  and  his  force  sufficed  not.     Beset  with  foemen  on  all  sides, 
Swords,  spears,  close-compacted  shields  came  crowding  around  him, 
Wielded  by  stalwart  forms,  both  many  and  fierce:  and  unwilling, 
Great  as  he  was,  renowned,  and  brave,  they  forced  him  before  them. 
Struggling,  indignant,  with  might  and  main,  o'erwhelmed,  he  retreated. 

Thus  did  they  toil,  and  in  deadly  fray  thus  struggled  the  heroes. 
Fate  meanwhile  the  mighty  Tlepolemus,  son  of  Heracles, 
Godlike  Sarpedon,  offspring  of  Zeus,  urged  on  to  encounter. 
Forth  in  front  of  the  ranks  they  strode,  approaching  each  other,    (630) 
Grandson  and  son  as  they  were  of  cloud-compelling  Kronion. 
Silence  first  Tlepolemus  broke,  and  this  was  his  challenge  : 

"What,  O  Sarpedon!  great  in  thy  Lycian  senate,  in  warfare 
Feeble  and  slight,  can  have  brought  thee  hither  to  quail  and  to  tremble? 
False  is  their  tale,  who  say  that  Zeus,  the  great  iEgis-upholder, 
Thou  for  thy  sire  may'st  claim.     How  far  were  those  thy  superiors, 
They  who  in  olden  time  such  lineage  rightfully  boasted  ! 
Such  was  my  own  great  sire,  th'  invincible  might  of  Herakles, 
He  who  the  soul  of  a  hero  bore,  and  the  heart  of  a  lion. 
Hither  he  came,  in  the  war  for  Laomedon's  steeds,  unsupported,  (640) 
Six  were  his  ships,  no  more!  and  few  the  troops  that  he  mustered; 
Yet  he  subdued  yon  city,  and  filled  its  dwellings  with  widows. 
As  for  thyself,  thy  spirit  is  mean,  thy  nation  decaying  : 
Small  is  the  aid,  and  poor  the  support  thou  bring'st  to  the  Trojans, 
Leaving  thy  Lycian  realm.     And  wert  thou  nobler  and  braver, 
Yet  should  my  spear  dismiss  thy  soul  through  the  portals  of  Hades." 

Thus  to  his  boasts  responded  the  Lycian  prince,  Sarpedon: 
"Rightly,  Tlepolemus  !  smote  thy  sire  yon  Irian  city. 
Harsh  were  the  words  and  rude  the  taunts  by  Laomedon  uttered, 
Prompted  by  evil  counsel  (ungrateful  return  for  his  friendship),  (650) 
When  he  refused  the  steeds  by  Herakles  justly  demanded. 


Book  V\]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  107 

This  for  the  past.     But  now  swift  doom  and  destruction  await  thee, 
Here  at  my  hands.  By  this  lance  shalt  thou  fall,  and  add  to  my  glory, 
Yielding  thy  soul  to  the  rider  of  death's  black  steed,  Aidoneus." 

Thus  Sarpedon.     His  tough  ash  spear  Tlepolemus  brandished. 
In  the  same  instant  flew  from  their  hands  both  weapons.     Sarpedon's 
Lighted  full  in  the  midst  of  his  foeman's  throat,  and  the  windpipe 
Pierced  with  the  deadly  point  straight  through;  and  he  sank  overpowered, 
While  the  thick  shades  of  eternal  darkness  closed  o'er  his  eyelids. 
But  with  less  skilful  aim  dispatched,  Tlepolemus'  jav'lin  (660) 

Smote  the  left  thigh  of  the  Lycian  prince,  and,  forcing  a  passage, 
Grated  across  the  bone.     But  Zeus  forbade  his  destruction. 
Rushed  to  his  aid  the  friends  of  the  wounded  chief,  and  they  bore  him 
Forth  from  the  fight — sore  hurt  by  the  long  spear  dragging  behind  him, 
For  in  their  eager  haste  to  place  him  secure  on  a  chariot, 
None  gave  a  thought  to  extract  that  tough  ash  spear  from  the  suff'rer; 
Such  was  the  press  around,  and  such  the  toil  and  the  danger. 
Dead  Tlepolemus  too  by  the  bright-greaved  Greeks,  his  companions, 
Off  from  the  field  was  borne.     This  fired  the  soul  of  Odysseus 
Vengeance   to  take  :  for  his  heart  was  grieved  and  his  wrath  was 

excited,  (670) 

Doubtful  awhile  he  stood,  and  perplexed  in  spirit,  debating 
Whether  to  follow  and  slay  the  retiring  son  of  the  Thund'rer, 
Or  to    spread   havoc  and   death  through  the  vulgar  throng   of  the 

Lycians. 
Not  to  his  lance  howe'er  was  decreed  the  fall  of  Sarpedon, 
Son  of  immortal  Zeus.      That,  fate  had  reserved  for  a?iother  : 
And  on  the  Lycian  host  Athena  directed  his  fury. 
Koiranus  first  he  slew.     Then  Chromius  fell,  and  Alastor, 
Halius  next,  Noemon,  Alcander,  and  Prytanis  perished. 
More  of  the  Lycian  host  had  Odysseus  hurled  to  destruction, 
But  that  the  piercing  glance  of  crest- waving  Hector  observed  him.  (680) 
And  to  the  van  he  advanced,  all  sheathed  in  glittering  armour, 
Struck  were  the    Greeks  with   dread. — When  Sarpedon  beheld  him 

approaching 
Cheered   was    his   heart,   though  his   voice  was   faint,  as   thus   he 
-  addressed  him : 


108  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

"  Leave  me  not,  Priamus'  son,  here  stretched,  a  prey  to  the  Grecians, 
Rescue  me  !     Let  me  expire  within  the  walls  of  your  city : 
There  full  fain  would  T  breathe  my  last,  since  fate  hath  forbid  me 
Ever  again  to  behold  my  native  land,  and  returning 
Gladden  the  hearts  of  my  dear-loved  wife  and  innocent  children." 

Thus  Sarpedon,  offspring  of  Zeus.     But  Hector  replied  not. 
Waving   his    lofty  plume,    on   the    Greeks   he   rushed,    to   disperse 
them  (690) 

Eager;  and  longing  to  dye  the  plain  with  the  blood  of  their  bravest. 
Under  a  beauteous  beech  meanwhile,  to  the  Thunderer  sacred, 
Borne  from  the  press  with  care  Sarpedon's  comrades  had  laid  him; 
Pelagon,  trusty  and  brave,  his  much-loved  friend  and  companion, 
Then  from  his  thigh  wrenched  forth  that  tough  ash  spear:  and  his 

senses 
Left  him  at  once,  and  his  swimming  sight  dark  mists  overshadowed. 
Yet  he.  revived,  and  his  strength  returned,  as  the  breezes  of  Boreas, 
Life  to  his  frame,  and  breath  to  his  panting  bosom  imparted. 

Now  before  Ares  fierce,,  and  mail-clad  He c~t  or,  the  Argives 
Neither  advanced  nor  fled.    Their  sable  vessels  they  sought  not,  (700) 
Nor  could  they  hold  their  ground;  but  backwards  ever  recoiling, 
Step  by  step  they  retreated :  for  Ares,  they  heard,  was  against  them. 

Now  let  the  Muse  recount  who  first,  who  last  of  the  Grecians 
Fell  by  the  conquering  hands-  of  Hector,  and  panoplied  Ares ! 
Teuthras  the  godlike,  Orestes  brave,  the  reiner  of  horses, 
Trechus,  the  famed  ^Etolian  warrior;  bold  CEnomaiis: 
Helenus,  CEnops'  son;  Oresbius  intent  upon  profit, 
Vain,  albeit,  of  his,  broidered  belt.     From  his  mansion  in  Hyle, 
Bord'ring  on  fair  Cephisus'  lake,  he  came,  where  his  kinsmen 
Fat  Boeotia's  soil  maintained  in  lazy  abundance.  (7IQ) 

Hera,  the  white-armed  queen  of  Heav'n,  indignant  beheld  them 
Scattering  death  through  the  Argive  host;  and  to  Pallas  Athene 
Turning,  in  words  of  impatient  wrath  accosted  the  goddess  : 
"What  then!  invincible  daughter  of  ./Egis-bearing  Kronion, 
Thus,  shall  our  pledge  be  vain  which  we  gave  to  the  brave  Menelaiis, 
Troy's  proud  walls  to  subvert  and  restore  him  in  triumph  to  Argos. 
Thus  shall  we  suffer  insulting  Ares  to  rage  and  to  slaughter? 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  109 

Not  so  !    Join  with  me  now,  and  bear  we  our  part  in  the  combat." 
Thus  she  spake  :  and  blue-eyed  Pallas,  rejoicing,  obeyed  her 
Hastily;  then  imperial  Here,  daughter  of  Kronos,  (72°) 

Braced  on   th'  immortal  coursers  their   frontlets  of  gold  and   their 

harness ; 
Hebe  the  brazen  wheels  then  fixed  to  the  car,  on  an  axle 
Wrought  out   of  polished  steel.      Eight  spokes  each  bore,  and   the 

felloes 
Flamed  resplendent  of  gold  indestructible.    Round  them  were  fastened 
Tires  of  brass,  close-binding,  a  wondrous  work.     But  the  chariot 
Hung  suspended  on  bands  of  silver  and  gold,  and  a  border 
Gracefully  curving  in  two-fold  swell  projected  before  it. 
Silver  were  both  the  naves,  and  the  pole  of  silver  refulgent 
Stood  forth   in  front,   and  received   the   yoke   which   she  fastened 

upon  it, 
Splendidly  wrought  of  gold.     Then  Here  led  forth  the  coursers,  (730) 
Placed  on  their  necks  the  yoke,  and  the  reins  attached  and  conducted 
Back  to  the  car;  then  mounted,  all  eager  and  panting  for  battle. 

Pallas  Athene,  daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Kronion, 
Then  let  fall  on  the  floor  of  her  father's  palace  the  mantle 
Gloriously   wrought   which   the    skill    of    her    own   fair   hands   had 

embroidered. 
Then  in  the  arms  of  cloud-compelling  Zeus  she  arrayed  her, 
Donning  his  corslet  for  dreary  war  and  the  horrors  of  battle. 
Broad  o'er  her  shoulders  slung  was  the  dreadful  Thunderer's  ^Egis, 
Serpent-fringed,  whose  sculptured  orb  pale  terror  encircled, 
flight,  pursuit,  o'erwhelming  force,  and  bloody  contention;  (740) 
While  in  the  centre  glared  Jove's  dire  portent  of  the  Gorgon, 
Monstrous  and  ghastly;  a  sight  which  7ione  might  survive  who  beheld  it. 
Raised  on  ridges  of  gold  four  plumes  o'ershadowed  her  helmet, 
Rich  with  the  spoil  of  a  hundred  towns  and  the  forms  of  their  warriors. 
Armed,  on  the  fiery  car  she  sprang,  firm  grasping  her  jav'lin, 
Stubborn  and  huge,  with  whose  pond'rous  force  uplifted  in  anger, 
Child  of  a  mighty  sire,  she  quells  the  array  of  her  foemen. 
Forthwith  Hera  the  scourge  applied  and  excited  the  coursers. 
Clanging,  self-open'd,  the  gates  of  Heav'n  flew  wide,  by  the  Horae 


no  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Guarded,     to    whom    are    entrusted    the    portals    of    Heav'n    and 

Olympus;  (75°) 

Or  to  roll  back  their  veil  of  cloud,  or  wrap  them  in  darkness. 
Urged  to  their  utmost  speed  through  these  the  celestial  coursers 
Bore  them  to  where  Kronion  they  found,  apart  and  secluded, 
Thron'd  on  the  loftiest  of  all  the  bristling  peaks  of  Olympus. 
Him  when  the  white-arm'd  Hera  beheld,  her  steeds  she  arrested, 
ProfFring  her  prayer  unto  Zeus  in  words  of  complaint  and  of  question : 
''Father   supreme!  shall  thy  vengeance  sleep  o'er  these  murders  of 

Ares? 
Lo !  what  crowds  of  my  noblest  Greeks  he  hath  hurled  to  destruction, 
Reckless  alike  of  law,  and  of  thy  command,  and  my  sorrow. 
Cypris  the  while,  and  the  God  of  the  silver  bow,  are  delighted,    (760) 
They!  who  let  loose  his  frantic  rage  and  enjoy  it  in  quiet. 
Father!  oh!  Father,  wilt  thou  be  wroth  if  I  wreak  upon  Ares 
Vengeance  and  painful  wounds,  and  drive  him  forth  from  the  battle?" 
Thus  to  her  prayer  responded  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion  : 
"So  be  it  done !     Let  Athena,  delighting  in  spoil  and  in  conquest, 
Punish  him.     Many  a   time   hath  she   wrought   him   affliction   and 

anguish." 
Thus  he  spake:  and  Hera,  rejoicing  to  hear  the  permission, 
Lashed  her  steeds;  and  with  right  good  will  they  flew  through  the  ether 
Spread  forth  between  this  earth  and  the  star-strewn  concave  of  Heaven, 
Clearing,  at  ev'ry  bound,  such  space  as  the  eye  of  a  gazer,     (770) 
Seated  on  some  commanding  cliff  on  the  verge  of  the  ocean, 
Views,  o'er  the  wine-dark  sea,  to  the  utmost  haze  of  the  offing. 
Soon  on  the  plains  of  Troy  they  arrived,  where,  mingling  their  waters, 
Simois  clear  and  Scamander  swift  roll  on  to  the  ocean. 
There  did  she  draw  the  rein,  and  arrest  the  speed  of  her  coursers. 
Loosed  from  the  car,  and  wrapped  in  a  veil  of  canopied  vapour, 
Free  upon  Simois'  bank  they  cropped  ambrosial  pasture. 
Thence  with  the  darting  flight  of  doves  when  the  hawk  is  pursuing, 
Hasted  th'  immortal  pair  to  give  aid  and  support  to  the  Argives; 
Soon  they  arrived  where  at  bay  they  stood  :   their  best  and  their 

bravest,  (780) 

Wedged  in  a  close  compacted  mass  round  brave  Diomedes, 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  1 1 1 

They,  like  a  troop  of  devouring  lions  who  gloat  upon  carnage, 
Stood;  or  like  boars  in  their  native  wilds,  untameably  savage. 
Mingling  among  them,  the  goddess  her  voice  uplifted  and  shouted, 
Taking  the  form  of  Stentor  the  brazen-throated,  whose  war-cry 
Loud  as  the  shout  of  fifty  men  could  be  heard  o'er  the  tumult : 

"Shame  on  ye  Argives!  noble  forms,  but  pitiful  soldiers! 
'Twas  not  thus  when  mighty  Achilles  went  forth  to  the  combat, 
Then  did  the  Trojans  cow'r;  nor  before  the  gates  of  their  city 
Dared  they  advance:  for  they  dreaded  the  sweep  of  his  conquering 
jav'lin.  (79°) 

Far  from  their  ramparts  now  they  threaten  your  camp  and  your  vessels." 
Thus  as  she  spake  each  bosom  imbibed  fresh  vigour  and  courage. 
Blue-eyed  Athene  then  sought  out  the  brave  Diomedes, 
And   by    the   chariots   the    Prince    surrounded    she   found,  and   the 

horses, 
Tending  the  rankling  wound  which  Pandarus'  shaft  had  inflicted. 
Oozed  forth  the  sweat  in  streams  from  beneath  the  broad  belt  of  his 

buckler. 
Fainting,  with  painful  effort  his  wearied  hand  he  uplifted, 
Raised  up  the  belt  from  his  breast,  and  wiped  the  black  blood  from 

his  shoulder. 
Pallas  approached,  and  the  chariot-yoke  she  touched  and  addressed  him : 
"Tydeus'  offspring  his  sire  renowned  but  little  resembles.  (800) 
Tydeus  indeed  in  person  was  small,  yet  great  as  a  warrior. 
He,  when  I  bade  him  abstain  from  war,  nor  rush  to  the  conflict, 
When  on  a  peaceful  mission  to  Thebes  he  went,  unattended, 
'Mong  the  Cadmean  chiefs,  no  aid  at  hand  from  the  Argives; 
Scorning  to  take  his  ease,  and  accept  the  delights  of  their  palace, 
Goaded  on  by  that  fiery  heart  which  never  forsook  him, 
Challenged  them,  one  and  all,  the  Cadmean  youth,  and  in  combat 
Easily  overcame  them  all — such  aid  did  I  grant  him. 
Thee  too  I  aid  and  beside  thee  stand,  thy  help  and  protection, 
Bidding  thee  summon  thy  strength  and  bravely  rush  on  the  Trojans.  (8 1  o) 
Say  !     Do  thy  limbs,  o'erlaboured  and  faint,  refuse  to  support  thee, 
Or  is  it  heartless  fear  that  unmans  thy  soul?     Must  I  deem  thee, 
Not  the  true  offspring  of  Tydeus,  and  not  the  grandson  of  GEneus?" 


ii2  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Then  in  his  turn  replying,  thus  spake  the  brave  Diomedes: 
"Goddess!     I  know  thee,  daughter  of  ^gis-bearing  Kronion : 
Nor  will  I  aught  conceal,  but  speak  to  thee  frankly  and  truly. 
Fear  nor  sloth  is  the  cause  that  restrains  and  holds  me  inactive, 
'Tis  but  thine  own  command,  which  I  bear  in  mind  and  obey  it. 
Didst  thou  not  bid  me  respect  th'  immortal  Gods  in  the  tumult — 
Strike    at    all    else ;     but    should    bright    Aphrodite     mix    in    the 
combat,  (820) 

(Daughter  of  Zeus  though  she  be),  let  her  feel  the  point  of  my  weapon? 
For  this  cause  have  I  ceased  from  fight,  and  gathered  around  me 
These  brave  Greeks — if  haply  our  ground  we  may  hold — for  against  us 
Ares  himself  I  perceive,  in  person,  leading  the  Trojans. 

Thus  Tydeides  :  and  thus  the  blue-eyed  Athena  responded : 
"First  in  my  dear  regard  and  protection,  brave  Diomedes! 
Dread  not  this  Ares,  dire  as  he  is.     Fear  none  of  th'  immortals, 
Here  while  Pallas  beside  thee  stands  to  strengthen  and  aid  thee. 
Urge  thou  at  once  upon  Ares  thy  prancing  steeds,  and  attack  him, 
Closing  upon  him,  hand  to  hand.     Respect  not  his  Godhead,      (830) 
Him — the  outrageous, — faithless  ally — promoter  of  mischief. 
Did  he  not  promise  myself  and  Hera  to  fight  in  our  quarrel, 
Aid  to  bring  to  our  Argive  friends,    and  war  to  the  Trojans? 
Now  to  the  winds  such  oaths  he  casts,  and  combats  against  us." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  Sthenelus  seizing,  down  from  the  chariot 
Dragged  him  back  to  the  ground;  and  he  rushed  from  the  spot  in 

amazement; 
While  to  his  place  in  the  car,  by  the  side  of  brave  Diomedes, 
Sprang  the  excited  Goddess.     Then  groaned  the  ponderous  axle 
"Under  the  weight  of  a  Pow'r  so  dread,  and  so  mighty  a  hero. 
Seizing     the    whip     and    the     falling    reins,    she    lashed    on    the 
horses,  (840) 

Urging  them  forward  in  full  career,  direct  upon  Ares. 

Periphas  huge  and  strong  he  had  just  struck  down  in  his  fury, 
Son  of  Ochesius,  bravest  and  best  of  yEtolia's  warriors 
Murd'rously  slain.     Then  Pallas  assumed  the  dark  helmet  of  Orcus, 
Shrouding  her  form  in  gloom,  lest  the  God,  beholding,  might  know  her. 
Soon  as  the  fierce  destroyer  perceived  divine  Diomedes, 


Book  V.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  113 

Leaving  unspoiled  the  mighty  corse  of  the  prostrated  warrior, 
There  on  the  spot  where  he  just  had  fall'n  and  breathed  forth  his  spirit, 
Fiercely  he  rushed  on  the  vent'rous  chief  who  dared  to  confront  him. 
Nearing  each  other  thus,  when  now  short  space  was  between  them,  (850) 
Ares,  forward  advanced  o'er  the  yoke  and  reins  of  his  horses, 
Darted  his  long-protended  spear,  all  eager  to  slay  him, 
Vainly  I  for  Pallas  Athena  the  weapon  seized  and  diverted 
Wide  of  its  aim,  from  the  car  far  borne  where  stood  Diomedes. 
He  in  his  turn  with  a  shout  dismissed  his  glittering  jav'lin, 
Which  in  its  flight  the  blue-eyed  Pallas  guiding,  directed 
Full  on  the  furious  God.     Through  his  belt  it  pierced  and,  his  body 
Entering,  rent  his  groin  with  a  ghastly  wound.     Diomedes 
Sprang  with  a  bound  from  his  lofty  car  and  recovered  his  weapon. 
Then  with  a  brazen  roar  loud  bellowed  the  God  in  his  anguish,    (860) 
Loud  as  the  shout  of  ten  thousand  warriors  closing  in  battle. 
Dread  was  the  panic  and  dire  which  seized  both  hosts  when  they  heard 

him, 
Greeks  and  Trojans  alike — and  they  paused  in  their  work  of '  destruclion, 
Trembling  with  deadly  fear  at  the  roar  of  discomfited  Ares. 

As  when  a  column  of  cloud  by  the  burning  blasts  of  the  desert, 
Whirled  aloft  through  the  stifling  air  soars  high  in  the  ether, 
Thus,  gazing  up,  Tydeides  beheld  infuriate  Ares 
Rise  with  a  swirl,  and  mix  with  the  dark  rolling  clouds  that  received 

him. 
Soon  to  Olympus  he  came,  high  seat  of  the  blessed  immortals, 
There  in  the  presence  of  Zeus  sat  down,  and  murmuring  loudly,  (870) 
Shewed  the  immortal  blood  fast  flowing :  and  thus  he  bespake  him : 

"Father Zeus!  canst  thou  view  such  deeds  nor  care  to  avenge  them? 
Still  must  celestial  Pow'rs  complain  of  wrongs  that  they  suffer, 
Each  at  another's  hands,  while  favours  they  heap  upon  mortals? 
Thee  do  we  all  accuse.     She  is  thine,  this  infuriate  daughter, 
Ever  delighting  in  evil  deeds  and  bent  on  destruclion. 
All  the  Olympian  pow'rs  beside  delight  to  obey  thee. 
Each,  for  himself,  in  thy  rule  rejoicing,  seeks  but  thy  pleasure. 
Her  dost  thou  ne'er  reprove,  nor  put  forth  thy  hand  to  restrain  her, 
Freely  indulged  in  all,  as  thine  own  peculiar  offspring.  (880) 


ii4  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  V. 

Lo  !  where  she  urges  on  this  insolent  offspring  of  Tydeus, 
Madly  to  rage,  and  measure  his  strength  with  the  pow'rs  of  Olympus. 
Cypris  approaching  he  first  attacked,  and  her  wrist  with  his  jav'lin 
Pierced ;  then  rushed  on  myself  with  might  scarce  less  than  immortal. 
Well  for  me  that  my  flight  was  swift!  else,  groaning  in  anguish, 
There  had  I  lain,  o'erwhelmed  by  the  dreadful  piles  of  the  slaughtered  ; 
Shorn  of  my  strength  by  wounds  and  dragging  a  wretched  existence." 

Sternly  frowning  replied  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion : 
" Faithless!    Shifter  from  side  to  side!    Why  sit'st  thou  complaining? 
Hateful  beyond  all  Gods  whom  mine  eyes  behold  in  Olympus,     (890) 
Discord  is  ever  thy  soul's  delight,  and  battle,  and  slaughter. 
Thine  is  thy  mother  Hera's  perverse,  unbearable  temper, 
Whom  by  words  alone  I  can  scarce  restrain  from  rebellion. 
She  by  her  evil  guidance  hath  wrought  thee  the  pain  thou  endurest. 
Yet  it  delights  me  not  to  behold  thee  wounded  and  suff'ring. 
Offspring  of  mine  thou  art,  and  to  me  thy  mother  hath  borne  thee. 
Hadst  thou,  reckless  destroyer !  some  other  God  for  thy  parent, 
Lower  than  ev'n  that  hated  Uranian  crew  had  I  plunged  thee." 

Thus  spake  Zeus,  and  Paeon  he  called  and  commanded  to  heal  him, 
Who  to  the  wound  some  pain-assuaging  balsam  applying,  (900) 

Healed  it  at  once :  for  nought  that  could  die  pertained  to  his  nature. 
Swift,  as  the  curdling  milk  with  the  fig's  rich  juice  intermingled 
Fixes,  a  liquid  before,  and  collects  on  the  hand  of  the  mixer, 
Closed  up  the  flesh;  and  x\res  again  stood  forth  in  his  vigour. 
Hebe  a  bath  prepared ;  and  in  robes  of  festive  adornment 
Clothed,  he  resumed  his  seat  near  Zeus,  exulting  in  glory. 

Then  too  returned  once  more  to  the  sacred  dome  of  Olympus 
Argive  Hera  herself  and  Alalcomenean  Athena, 
Ares  at  length  being  quelled  and  his  deeds  of  slaughter  arrested.  (909)

Argument. 

The  battle  continues,  viclory  now  inclining  to  the  side  of  the  Greeks. 
Heclor  by  the  advice  of  Helenus  retm  ns  to  Troy  to  order  offerings  and 
supplications  to  be  ?nade  to  Pallas.  Meanwhile  Diomede  and  Glaucus 
meet,  and  recognizing  a  tie  of  ancient  hospitality  between  their  fathers 
separate  a?nicably,  exchanging  armour.  Hecuba  and  the  Trojan  matrons 
go  in  procession  to  the  temple  of  Pallas  and  offer  prayers,  presenting  a 
robe.  Heclor  proceeds  to  the  palace  of  Paris  who7n  he  finds  with  Helen, 
and  who  at  his  summons  arms  and  prepares  to  follow  him  to  the  field. 
Heclor  returning  meets  Andromache  his  wife  with  her  infant  child;  and 
unmoved  by  her  entreaties  to  remain,  takes  an  affeclionate  leave  of  her 
and,  being  now  joined  by  Paris,  returns  to  the  battle.

TVT  OW  by  the  Gods  abandoned,  the  Greeks  and  Trojans  contended. 
Wide  o'er  the  plain,  now  here,  now  there,  the  battle  was  raging, 
Troop  upon  troop  advancing  with  levelled  spears  on  each  other 
All  between  Simois'  flood  and  the  rolling  waters  of  Xanthus. 

Foremost,  the  bulwark  of  Greece,  the  great  Telamonian  Aias, 
Broke  through  the  Troian  array  and  admitted  the  light  for  his  comrades. 
Acamas  down  he  struck,  Eussorus'  son,  of  the  Thracians 
Bravest  and  best — a  chief  renowned,  and  mighty  in  stature. 
Close  to  the  ridge  of  his  crested  helm  where  it  rose  from  the  convex 
Entered  the  spear,  and  pierced  the  bone,  and  deep  in  his  forehead  (10) 
Fix'd,  stood  forth.     He  fell,  and  darkness  closed  on  his  eyelids. 

Next  fell  Axylus,  Teuthras'  son,  by  brave  Diomedes 
Reft  of  his  life ;  who  in  fair  Arisbe's  fortified  city 
Lived  at  his  ease,  in  wealth  and  beloved  by  all ;  for  he  welcomed 
All  by  his  gates  who  passed :  and  close  on  the  path  was  his  dwelling. 
Now  not  a  friend  was  near  to  save  him  from  cruel  destruction 
Meeting,  or  warding  the  blow.     Himself  and  his  faithful  attendant 
Old  Calesius,  who  stood  by  his  side  and  guided  his  horses, 
Both  to  the  earth  were  hurled,  and  a  common  grave  was  their  portion. 

Dresus,    Euryalus    next,    and    Opheltius    slew.       Having    slain 
them,  (20) 

Then  on  ^Esepus  he  rushed  and  Pedasus,  youths  whom  the  Naiad 
Fair  Abarbarea  bore,  and  their  birth  concealed;  by  Bucolion 
Pregnant,  mighty  Laomedon's  son,  of  unblameable  lineage, 


n8  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VI. 

Eldest  born  of  his  sire ;  whose  sheep  while  tending  he  met  her 
Oft  in  the  flowery  fields,  and  in  love's  soft  bands  they  consorted. 
There  fair  twins  she  produced  and  reared,  the  fruit  of  their  union. 
Great  Mecistheus'  son  their  strength  subdued,  and  their  armour 
Stripped  from  their  stalwart  limbs,  and  left  the??i  a  prey  to  the  vultures. 

Then  too  by  brave  Polyposes'  hand  Astyalus  perished. 
Godlike  Odysseus  pierced  with  his  spear  the  Percosian  leader  (30) 
Pidytus.     Teucer  slew  the  redoubted  chief  Aretaon. 
Mighty  Antilochus,  Nestor's  son,  with  his  glittering  jav'lin 
Laid  Ablerus  low;  and  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
Elatus,  who,  on  the  banks  of  Satnois'  stream,  where  it  washes 
Rock-built  Pedasus,  dwelt.     Brave  Leitus'  weapon  arrested 
Phylacus  flying.     Melanthius  fell  by  Eurypylus'  jav'lin. 

Brave  Menelaiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  Adrestus 
Captured  alive;  for  his  steeds  o'er  the  plain  while  rushing  bewildered, 
Caught  in  a  tamarisk's  root,  o'erturned  his  chariot,  and  struggling 
Tore  off  the  yoke  from  the  broken  pole,  and  away  to  the  city         (40) 
Hurried,  and  joined  the  terrified  rout  which  there  was  collecting. 
He  from  the  chariot  headlong  tossed  lay  bruised  a?id  defe?iceless, 
Prostrate,  his  face  in  the  dust :  while  o'er  him  stood  Menelaiis, 
Atreus'  son,  with  his  mighty  spear  uplifted  to  slay  him. 
Thus  then,  clasping  his  knees  besought  him  wretched  Adrestus : 

"Spare  my  life,  O  Atreides!  and  take  the  ransom  I  offer, 
Untold  wealth  in  my  father's  house  is  stored.     In  abundance 
Gold  he  possesses  and  brass  and  steel  well-tempered  and  burnished. 
All  he  hath,  without  stint,  will  he  lay  at  thy  feet  for  my  ransom, 
Soon  as  he  hears  that  his  son  survives  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians."  (50) 

Thus  he  prayed,  and  Atreides  was  touched  at  heart  with  compassion, 
And  would  have  bidden  his  faithful  attendant  lead  him  a  pris'ner, 
Far  away  to  the  Grecian  ships  :  but  stem  Agamemnon 
Up  came  running  in  haste,  and  with  loud  reproaches  addressed  him  : 

"  Weak  Menelaiis !  soft-hearted !    Have  these  such  claims  on  thy  pity? 

Glorious  works  these  Trojans  have  wrought  for  thee  and  thy  household, 

That  thou  should'st  spare  them !  Perish  they  all  in  headlong  destruction ! 

None   shall  escape   our  hands.     Not  the  babe  in  the  womb  of  his 

mother 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  119 

Borne;  nor  the  wretch  who  flies.     Who  bears  the  name  of  a  Trojan, 
Down   with   him !     There   let   him   lie,    dishonoured,    unwept,    and 
unburied."  (60) 

Thus  admonished,  a  change  came  o'er  the  mood  of  his  brother; 
Back  with  his  hand  he  thrust  the  suppliant  chief.    Agamemnon 
Ruler  of  men,  then  raised  his  spear  and  deep  in  his  entrails 
Plunged  it  with  deadly  force:  and  he  writhed  on  the  earth.  But  Atreides 
Planted  his  heel  on  his  breast  and  the  tough  ash  weapon  extracted. 

Nestor  then  the  Achaian  troops,  loud  shouting,  exhorted  : 
"Friends  and  heroes  of  Greece  !  ye  valiant  servants  of  Ares! 
Stay  not  now  to  despoil  the  dead.     Not  one  of  you  linger, 
Greedily  bent  on  prey  and  increasing  his  store  in  our  vessels. 
Think  ye  of  nothing  now,  but  to  slay  your  foes:  and,  the  battle         (70) 
Won,  when  in  heaps  they  lie,  ye  shall  strip  their  arms  at  your  leisure." 

Thus  as  he  spake  each  heart  imbibed  fresh  courage  and  ardour. 
Then  had  the  weakness  of  Troy  to  the  martial  force  of  the  Grecians 
Yielded  the  day,  and  the  Trojans  to  Ilion  fled  in  confusion, 
Had  not  Helenus,  Priamus'  son,  the  wisest  of  augurs, 
Taken  his  stand  by  ^Eneas  and  Hector,  thus  to  address  them  : 

"Hector!    ^Eneas!    On  you  repose  the  conduct  and  guidance 
Both  of  the  Troian  and  Lycian  hosts.     On  ev'ry  occasion, 
Whether  for  council  or  war,  ye  are  best  and  bravest.     Attend  then. 
Haste  through  the  ranks  and  rally  our  men  and  close  them  together,  (80) 
Making  a  stand  before  the  gates,  that  they  fly  not  for  refuge, 
Home  to  their  wives'  embraces,  a  scorn  and  jest  for  our  foemen. 
When  ye  have  cheered  our  troops  and  restored  our  order  of  battle, 
Here  will  we  stay,  resolved  and  firm,  and  maintain  our  position, 
Wearied  albeit  and  worn.     We  must  fight  or  die,  a?id  we  know  it. 
Hector!  do  thou  meanwhile  to  the  city  proceed,  and  our  mother 
Seek — thy  mother  and  mine. — Bid  her  call  our  matrons  around  her, 
And  on  our  holiest  hill,  at  the  fane  of  blue-eyed  Athene, 
Ope  with  her  key  those  sacred  doors,  and,  forth  from  her  treasures 
Choosing  a  mantle,  whiche'er  she  may  deem  her  fairest  and  amplest,  (90) 
That  which  Athena  may  best  approve  and  accept  as  an  off  ring, 
Spread  it  across  the  knees  of  the  fair-haired  Goddess,  and  suppliant 
Vow  twelve  heifers,  firstlings,  untouched  by  the  goad,  in  her  temple 


120  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VI. 

And  on  her  altars  to  burn :  and  implore  with  earnest  entreaties 
Pity  for  Troy,  for  her  matrons  chaste  and  innocent  children. 
So  may  she  turn  from  Ilion's  walls  this  scourge  of  our  armies 
Tydeus'  son,  this  warrior  fierce,  this  lord  of  the  battle. 
Greatest  of  all  the  Achaian  chiefs  and  bravest  I  deem  him. 
Not  more  dread  was  Achilles'  self,  that  noblest  of  mortals 
And,  as  they  say,  from  a  goddess  sprung:  for  he  rages  in  fury      (too) 
Wild  beyond  all  control ;  nor  can  one  be  found  to  resist  him." 

Thus  spake  the  seer:   and  Hector  obeyed  the  command   of  his 
brother ; 
Armed  as  he  was,  at  once  to  the  ground  he  sprang  from  his  chariot. 
Brandishing  two  sharp  spears  he  passed  through  the  host  of  the  Trojans 
Rousing  their  flagging  force,  and  inflaming  their  zeal  for  the  combat. 
Quick  they  rallied  and  turned,  and  again  confronted  the  Grecians ; 
These  in  their  turn  gave*  way  and  retired,  desisting  from  slaughter, 
Deeming  that  down  from  the  starry  skies  some  God  had  descended, 
Aid  to  their  foes  to  bring :  so  nobly  they  rallied  and  faced  them. 
Hector  then  cried  aloud  and  thus  exhorted  the  Trojans:         (no) 

"  High-minded  sons  of  Troy,  and  renown'd  confederate  warriors  ; 
Shew  yourselves  men,  dear  friends!   nor  forget  your  prowess   and 

valour. 
While  I  to  Ilion  wend,  and  exhort  our  elders  and  sages, 
Bowed  with  the  weight  of  years,  and  our  wives,  to  flock  to  the  temple, 
There  to  propitiate  Heav'n  with  prayer,  and  hecatombs  promise." 

Crest-waving  Hector  spake,  and  to  Troy  his  course  he  directed. 
Slung  behind  him,  his  bossy  shield  on  his  neck  and  his  ankles, 
Clashed  at  each  step  as  he  strode,  with  its  tough  black  margin  of 
leather. 

Now  between  both  the  hosts  advanced,  preparing  for  combat, 
Glaucus,  Hippolochus'  valiant  son,  and  the  might  of  Tydeides.    (120) 
While  they  approached  each  other,  and  now  small  space  was  between 

them, 
Great  Diomedes  spake,  and  thus  addressed  his  opponent : 

"  Bravest,  or  rashest  of  mortal  men,  say!  Whence,  and  who  art  thou? 
Ne'er  did  mine  eyes  thy  form  discern  in  the  glorious  battle: 
Bold  must  thou  be,  and  daring  beyond  all  others,  who  vent'rest 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  121 

Thus  to  confront  the  force  of  my  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin. 
Sons  of  unhappy  sires  are  those  who  meet  me  in  combat ! 
If  thou  be  one  of  th'  immortal  Gods  come  down  from  Olympus, 
Pass  on  thy  path:  for,  know  with  celestial  might  I  contend  not. 
All  must  have  heard  how  great  Lycurgus,  offspring  of  Dryas,  (130) 
Lived  not  long,  not  long  survived  that  impious  conflict, 
When  he,  in  Nysa's  sacred  groves  surprised,  and  on  all  sides 
Scattered  the  nursing  nymphs  of  the  frantic  god  Dionysus. 
Each  on  the  ground  her  grape-twined  thyrsus  cast,  by  Lycurgus 
Slayer  of  men,  with  a  goad  pursued  and  pierced.     Dionysus 
Plunged  in  affright  'neath  Ocean's  waves,  in  the  bosom  of  Thetis 
Cherished  and  safe :  for  the  shouting  was  fierce,  and  he  trembled  with 

terror ; 
Then  was  the  wrath  declared  of  the  blissful  Gods,  and  Kronion 
Smote  him  with  loss  of  sight.     Nor  long  survived  the  insulter, 
Thenceforth  ever  pursued  by  the  hatred  of  all  the  immortals.       (140) 
Warned  by  his  fate,  the  blessed  Gods  I  dread  to  encounter : 
But  if  a  mortal  thou  be, — if  the  fruits  of  the  field  be  thy  nurture, 
Then  come  on!     Full   soon   shalt  thou  pass  through  the  gates  of 

destruction." 
Thus  to  his  speech  the  son  of  renowned  Hippolochus  answered : 
"Why  dost  thou,  noble  Tydeides  !  enquire  my  nation  and  lineage? 
Man's  generations  flourish  and  fall,  like  the  leaves  of  the  forest. 
Leaves  on  the  earth  by  winds  are  strown,  yet  others  succeed  them, 
Ever  renewed  with  returning  spring.     So  fares  it  with  mortals : 
One  generation  decays  and  its  place  is  filled  by  another. 
Yet  wouldst  thou  learn  my  descent,  then  list  the  tale  I  shall  tell 

thee,  (150) 

Widely  already  diffused  by  fame  through  many  a  nation. 
Deep  in  a  gulf  retired  of  Argos,  famed  for  its  horses, 
Ephyre  stands.     There  Sisyphus  dwelt,  the  wiliest  of  mortals, 
Sisyphus,  ^Eolus'  son,  and  himself  the  father  of  Glaucus. 
Next  in  descent  Bellerophon  came,  the  brave  and  the  stainless; 
Beauty  of  form  and  graceful  strength  in  him  were  united, 
Gifts  of  the  Gods.     Him  Prcetus  hated  and  planned  his  destruction. 
Forth  from  his  country  he  drove  him,  (for  Prcetus  ruled  o'er  the  Argives 


122  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VI. 

Highest  in  power  and  place,  since  Zeus  dominion  had  giv'n  him,) 
For  that  his  wife  Antaea,  by  lawless  passion  excited,  (J6o) 

Burned  to  attract  Bellerophon's  love;  but  failed  to  persuade  him, 
Pure  as  he  was  and  blameless ;  and  all  her  charms  he  resisted. 
Then  did  she  poison  Prcetus'  mind  with  false  accusations : 
'  Die  thyself,  O  Prcetus  !  or  slay  this  presumptuous  traitor, 
Him,  who  thy  chaste  Antsea  would  tempt  to  swerve  from  her  duty.' 
These  insidious  words  when  he  heard,  his  anger  was  kindled. 
Slay  him  indeed  he  might  not :  his  soul  revolted  at  murder  : 
Therefore,  to  Lycia's  realm  he  sent  him,  bearing  a  tablet 
Sealed,  for  Antaea's  father,  dark  hints  containing  and  symbols, 
Fraught  with  suggestions  dire :  thus  leading  him  on  to  destruction.  (170) 
Forth  he  fared,  by  the  Gods  conducted,  pure  in  his  conscience, 
And  unto  Lycia  came,  to  the  streams  of  eddying  Xanthus. 
There  by  the  prince  of  Lycia's  region  wide  was  he  welcomed, 
Feasted  for  nine  full  days.     Nine  oxen  smoked  on  the  altars. 
But  when  the  tenth  revolving  dawn  with  her  roseate  fingers 
Tinted  the  eastern  sky,  the  prince  demanded  his  errand, 
Claiming  to  see  the  missive  of  Prcetus,  spouse  of  his  daughter. 
Then,  when  the  fatal  tablet  the  youth  produced,  and  he  read  it, 
First  he  enjoined  him  the  fierce  Chimasra's  rage  to  encounter. 
Dire   was    her    strength :    untamed,    not    gender'd    on    earth,    but 

celestial,  (I^o) 

Lion  before  and  dragon  behind,  she-goat  in  the  middle, 
Breathing  flames  fro?n  her  dreadful  jaws  in  bickering  volumes. 
Yet  with  miraculous  help  he  sought  this  monster  and  slew  her. 
Next  with  the  fierce  Solymaean  hosts  he  fought,  and  subdued  them. 
(This  among  all  his  trials,  himself  confessed,  was  the  hardest.) 
Rivals  of  men  in  valour  the  Amazons  last  he  encountered. 
Home  returning  at  length,  fresh  snares  awaited  the  victor. 
Lycian  warriors,  the  choice  of  the  land,  were  stationed  in  ambush, 
Treacherously  seeking  his  life :  but  the  hero,  fearless  and  blameless, 
Fought  with  the  Gods  011  his  side,  and  not  one  escaped  from  his 

vengeance.  (I9°) 

Then  did  the  king  acknowledge  his  race  divine  and  his  prowess ; 
Kept  him  near  to  his  person  and  gave  him  his  daughter  in  marriage ; 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  123 

Gave  him,  moreover,  an  equal  share  in  his  throne  and  his  honours. 
Then  too,  the  Lycians  allotted  an  ample  tract  for  his  culture, 
Vineyard  and  field  far  stretching  and  fair,  their  best  and  their  choicest. 
Three  were  the  children  that  lady  bare,  the  fruits  of  their  marriage; 
Noble  Isander,  Hippolochus  brave,  and  Laodameia. 
Laodameia  was  fair  and  beloved  of  Zeus,  and  Sarpedon, 
Godlike  chief,  of  the  brazen  helm,  drew  birth  from  their  union. 
Hapless  Bellerophon,  hated  at  length  by  the  Gods,  went  wand'ring,  (20c) 
Shunning  the  paths  of  men,  and  his  heart  corroded  with  sorrow, 
Restless,  homeless,  alone,  through  the  dismal  wilds  of  Aleia. 
Ares,  demon  of  war,  Isander  slew,  as  in  battle 
B?-avely  his  fathers'  old  Solymcean  foes  he  encountered. 
Artemis'  hate  destroyed  the  beauteous  Laodameia. 
I  from  Hippolochus  sprang:  that  prince  I  claim  for  my  parent; 
Who,  when  he  sent  me  hither,  this  maxim  taught  me  at  parting: 
All,  and  in  all  to  excel,  and  ever  to  rank  with  the  foremost; 
So  to  behave  as  ne'er  to  disgrace  the  long  line  of  my  fathers, 
Noblest  of  all  who  in  Ephyre  dwelt  in  the  Lycian  dominions.       (210) 
Such  is  my  lineage  :  such  and  so  pure  the  blood  of  my  parents." 
Glaucus  thus.     With  surprise  and  joy  brave  Diomed  heard  him. 
Planting  his  spear  upright  in  the  teeming  soil,  he  responded, 
Courteously  thus  addressing  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people : 
"Then  are  we  friends  !     I  account  thee  an  ancient  guest  of  my 

father. 
CEnus  received  the  blameless  Bellerophon  erst  in  his  palace, 
Kept  him  for  twice  ten  days  and  royally  entertained  him; 
Each  of  the  heroes  a  parting  gift  conferred  on  the  other, 
CEnus  a  costly  belt  bestowed,  embroidered  on  purple, 
Brave  Bellerophon's  gift  was  a  golden  two-handled  goblet;      (220) 
This,  departing  from  Troy,  I  left  behind  in  my  palace. 
Tydeus  my  sire  I  remember  not,  for  he  left  me  an  infant, 
Ne'er  to  return,  what  time  our  Argives  perished  at  Thebag. 
Should'st  thou  to  Argos  come,  thy  friend  and  thine  host  thou  wilt 

find  me. 
Thou  in  thy  turn  be  mine,  thy  Lycian  realm  when  I  visit. 
Henceforth  therefore  avoid  we  each  other's  spears  in  the  battle, 


124  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VI. 

Trojans,  nor  friends  of  Troy  shall  I  lack  to  slay,  whom  th'  immortals 
Bring  within  reach  of  my  spear,  or  my  feet  o'ertake  in  the  tumult, 
Greeks  enough  shalt  thou  find :  them  slay,  (if  thou  can'st),  at  thy  pleasure. 
Now  then  exchange  we  arms  in  the  presence  of  all,  that  our  friend- 
ship (230) 
Pledged,  and  ancestral  ties,  by  all  who  behold  may  be  witnessed." 

Thus  having  said,    both   chiefs   from   their   chariots    sprang,    and 
advancing, 
Each  took  the  other's  hand,  and  mutual  oaths  were  repeated. 
Glaucus  in  reckless  exchange,  (for  Zeus  had  deprived  him  of  prudence), 
Doffed  his  resplendent  suit;  and,  Tydeides'  armour  receiving, 
Gold  for  brass,  an  hundred  beeves  for  nine,  he  returned  him. 

Hector  now  by  the  Scaean  gate  and  its  neighbouring  beech-tree 
Entered  Troy,  and  her  matrons  and  maids  came  flocking  around  him ; 
Eager  for  news  of  their  sons,  their  brothers,  their  friends  and  their 

husbands. 
All  to  the  temples  he  bade  repair  and  beseech  the  immortals,       (240) 
Instant  in  prayer;  for  dire  were  the  woes  o'er  many  impending. 
Thus  he  arrived  at  length,  where  the  gorgeous  palace  of  Priam 
Rose  upon  polish'd  columns  and  porches  fair.     In  its  precincts 
Duly  disposed  in  order,  and  forming  a  side  of  tlie  building, 
Fifty  chambers  were  ranged,  of  polish'd  marble  constructed, 
Side  by  side ;  where  the  sons  of  Priamus  slept,  with  their  consorts. 
Further  within,  stood  ranged  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  mansion 
Chambers  twelve,  high-roofed  and  of  polish'd  marble  constructed, 
Side  by  side;  where  the  husbands  of  Priamus'  daughters  reposing 
Took  their  nightly  rest  in  the  chaste  embrace  of  their  spouses.     (250) 
Just  as  he  entered,  his  mother  dear  coming  forth  he  encountered, 
Leading  Laodice,  fairest  of  all  the  daughters  of  Priam. 
Eagerly  grasping  his  hand,  she  endearingly  named,  and  bespoke  him : 

"Why,  my  son!  art  thou  here,  the  hard-fought  battle  forsaking? 
Surely  those  hateful  Greeks  press  sore,  and  up  to  the  city 
Nearer  and  nearer  urge  their  fierce  assaults,  and  thy  spirit 
Prompts  thee  to  raise  thy  hands  in  prayer  to  Zeus  in  his  temple. 
Yet  forbear,  till  I  bring  thee  cheering  wine.     Thou  may'st  pour  it 
First  in  libations  due,  unto  Zeus  and  the  other  immortals  : 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  125 

Drink  thou  then,  and  thy  soul  shall  be  cheered ;  thy  strength  be 
recruited.  (260) 

Blest,  to  the  toil-exhausted  frame  is  the  pow'r  of  the  wine-cup, 
Wearied  and  worn  like  thine,  in  defence  of  thy  kindred  and  country." 

Thus  then  the  lord  of  the  waving  plume,  great  Hector  responded: 
"Bring  me  not  wine,  O  mother  revered!  lest  its  might  overcome  me, 
Loosen  my  firm-knit  limbs,  and  betray  my  strength  and  my  valour. 
Ill  beseems  it  a  man  whose  hands  the  blood  of  his  foemen 
Reeki?ig,  unwashed,  pollutes,  libations  to  pour,  and  to  raise  them 
Heav'nward  in  prayer  at  the  shrine  of  cloud-compelling  Kronion. 
Thou,  dear  mother,  repair  to  the  fane  of  Athena  the  spoiler; 
Let  the  rich  incense  smoke;  let  the  matrons  walk  in  procession.  (270) 
Choose  from  thy  stores  the  mantle  thou  deem'st  thy  fairest  and  amplest, 
That  which  Athena  may  best  approve  and  accept  for  an  off'ring : 
Spread  it  across  the  knees  of  the  fair-hair'd  Goddess,  and  suppliant, 
Vow  twelve  heifers,  yearlings,  untouched  by  the  goad,  in  her  temple, 
And  on  her  altars  to  burn;  and  implore  with  earnest  entreaties 
Pity  for  Troy,  for  her  matrons  chaste  and  innocent  children. 
So  may  she  turn  from  Ilion's  walls  that  scourge  of  our  armies, 
Tydeus'  son,  that  warrior  fierce,  that  lord  of  the  battle, 
Now  then  do  thou  repair  to  the  fane  of  Athena  the  spoiler. 
I  myself  will  to  Paris  proceed  and  call  him  to  battle,  (280) 

If  he  will  hear  my  voice.     But  oh !  that  the  earth  would  in  ve?igeance 
Yawn  and  engulph  him;  pest  as  he  is,  by  Zeus  in  his  anger 
Sent  as  a  scourge  to  Troy,  to  Priam,  and  all  .his  descendants. 
Could  I  but  see  him  at  length  pass  down  to  the  regions  of  Hades, 
Then  were  my  soul  relieved  of  the  cares  and  griefs  that  oppress  it." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  his  mother  returned  to  the  palace,  and  sent  forth 
Handmaids,  who  summoned  the  noblest  dames  to  attend  the  procession. 
Down  she  stepped  to  her  chamber  fair  all  fragrant  with  odours, 
Piled  in  rich  heaps  where  her  gorgeous  mantles  lay,  by  the  fingers 
Wrought,  of  Sidonian  dames;  from  Sidon  brought,  in  the  voyage  (290) 
Homeward  across  the  boundless  sea;  what  time  Alexandros 
High-born  Helen  to  Troy  conveyed  from  her  home  and  her  country. 
Hecuba,  choosing  from  these,  selected  her  gift  for  Athene, 
Amplest  in  fold,  and  richest  in  broidered  work  and  in  colours. 


i26  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VI. 

Bright  as  a  star  it  shone,  and  it  lay  the  deepest  among  them. 
Forth  she  went,  and  the  matrons  of  Troia  followed  in  order. 

Now  to  Athene's  fane  on  the  loftiest  heights  of  the  city 
Came  they,  and  fair  Theano  unbarred  the  gates  of  the  temple, 
Daughter  of  Cisseus,  wife  of  the  valiant  horseman  Antenor; 
Priestess  was  she,  by  the  Trojans  named,  of  Pallas  Athene.     (300) 
All  then  lifted  their  hands,  and  cried  aloud  to  the  Goddess. 
Beauteous  Theano  now,  that  gorgeous  mantle  unfolding 
Spread  it  across  the  knees  of  the  fair-hair'd  Pallas,  and  suppliant, 
Thus  to  the  daughter  of  Zeus  supreme  preferred  their  petition  : 

"Glorious  Athena!     Goddess  divine!     Great  guardian  of  Troia, 
Break  thou  the  spear  oi  fierce  Diomedes!     Grant  that  he  perish  I 
Prostrate  before  the  Scsean  gate  let  him  roll  in  his  death-pang ! 
Then  shall  twelve  firstling  heifers,  untouched  by  goad,  in  thy  temple 
And  on  thine  altars  blaze:  if  so  thou  deign  but  to  rescue 
This  thy  city;  our  Troian  wives;  our  innocent  children."  (310) 

Thus  they  prayed,  thus  vowed  to  the  daughter  of  Zeus,  but  Athena 
Bent  not  her  ear  to  their  vows ;  and  refused  to  grant  their  petition. 

Hector  now  to  the  palace  was  come  where  dwelt  Alexandras. 
Glorious  it  rose,  by  builders  of  note  designed  and  completed, 
All  by  himself  through  Troy's  wide  realm  sought  out  and  assembled  : 
Court-yard  and  chamber  and  lofty  dome,  fit  dwelling  for  princes, 
Close  by  the  palace  of  He 61  or,  and  Priam's,  commanding  the  city. 
Godlike  Hector  approached  and  entered,  bearing  his  jav'lin, 
Cubits  eleven  in  length.     Bright  gleamed  the  point  of  the  weapon. 
Bronze  was   the   blade,  and  with  golden  rings   to   the  shaft  was  it 
fastened.  (320) 

Paris  he  found  in  his.  chamber  fair,  preparing  his  armour, 
Burnishing  breastplate  and  shield,  and  nicely  adjusting  his  bowstring. 
Argive  Helen  was  seated  nigh  with  her  maidens  around  her, 
Plying  their  delicate  tasks  'neath  the  watchful  eye  of  their  mistress. 
Hector  in  words  of  cutting  reproach  gave  vent  to  his  feelings : 

"Madman!    What  means  this  senseless  and  angry  retreat  from  thy 
duties? 
Falling  fast  are  our  troops,  round  the  walls  and  gates  of  the  city 
Slaughtered.     All  for  thy  sake  this  rage  and  tumult  of  battle 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  127 


Spreads  like  a  fire  around.  Thyself  were  wroth  with  another,  (329) 
Whom  thou  should 'st  find,  a  laggard  in  war  and  shunning  the  conflict. 
Up !  or  devouring  flames  will  involve  thyself  and  the  city." 

Thus  replied  in  his  turn  the  godlike  prince  Alexandros  : 
"Just,  O  Hector!  indeed,  though  severe,  are  the  words  thou  hast  spoken, 
Hear  what  I  say,  however,  and  give  it  thy  candid  attention. 
'Tis  not  in  anger  at  Troy  that  I  thus  retreat  to  my  chamber, 
Nor  in  disgust,  but  to  hide  my  shame  and  the  grief  that  consumes  me. 
Now  however  my  wife  with  kind  persuasion  hath  urged  me 
Back  to  the  war  to  return,  and  that  I  feel  to  be  better. 
Fortune  shifts,  and  the  vanquish'd  today  are  victors  tomorrow. 
Stay  then,  while  I  assume  my  arms  and  prepare  me  for  combat,   (340) 
Or,  if  it  please  thee,  go:  and  soon  shall  my  steps  overtake  thee." 

Thus  he  spake,  but  crest-waving  Hector  nothing  responded. 
Him  then  Helen  addressed  in  words  submissive  and  gentle  : 
"Brother  of  one  devoid  of  shame,  dire  auth'ress  of  mischief! 
Oh!  that  in  that  ill-omen'd  day  when  my  mother  produced  me, 
Tempests  wild  could  have  snatched  me  off  to  some  desolate  mountain, 
Or  in  the  waves  of  the  wide-resounding  ocean  have  whelmed  me, 
There  to  be  swept  away;  ere  all  this  mischief  had  happened. 
Yet  since  the  gods  have  decreed  such  things  should  be;  in  their  mercy 
Surely  they  might  have  giv'n  me  a  nobler  man  for  a  husband :      (350) 
One  who  could  feel  the  contempt  of  men,  and  be  moved  by  their  hatred ! 
Ne'er  hath  his  soul  been  constant  and  firm,  nor  ever  in  future 
Will  it:  and  bitter  I  ween  will  prove  the  fruits  he  shall  gather. 
Rest  thee  now  from  thy  toils  awhile,  and  seat  thee  beside  me, 
Here  on  this   seat.     On   thee,   O   my  brother !  the   cares   and   the 

labours 
Heavily  press,  which  my  shame  and  the  guilt  of  Paris  have  wrought 

thee. 
Surely  our  fates,  so  sad,  so  strange,  by  the  Thund'rer  awarded, 
Bards  in  some  future  age  in  their  songs  will  render  immortal." 

Hector,  lord  of  the  waving  plume  this  answer  returned  her : 
"Press  me  not,  Helen,  to  rest,  thus  kindly.  Occasion  permits  not,  (360) 
Much  do  I  long  to  return  and  afford  my  aid  to  our  Trojans, 
Sore  bested,  and  who  bitterly  feel  the  want  of  my  presence.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  VI. 


Therefore  do  thou  this  husband  of  thine  excite.    Let  him  hasten, 
Armed  and  prepared,  as  becomes  a  man,  for  battle,  to  join  me, 
Ere  I  shall  leave  the  city:  where  yet  I  must  linger  a  moment, 
Once  more  to  see  my  home,  and  my  dear-loved  wife,  and  our  infant. 
Never  again  perchance  may  my  footsteps  back  from  the  combat 
Lead   me,   should  Heav'n  decree  that  I   fall  by  the  hands  of  the 
Grecians." 

Thus  spake  the  crested  chief,  and  thus  having  said,  he  departed 
Bending  his  course  to  his  stately  mansion,  high  in  the  city,  (37°) 

Seeking  Andromache  fair.     But  he  found  her  not  in  the  palace. 
She  with  her  infant  dear,  and  close-mantled  nurse,  on  a  watch-tow'r 
Far  overlooking  the  field,  stood  weeping  and  bitterly  moaning. 

Hector,  who  found  not  within  his  spotless  wife,  on  the  threshold 
Paused,  as  he  left  the  house,  and  thus  he  questioned  her  maidens : 
"Tell  me,  ye  maidens,  faithfully  tell  me  the  things  I  shall  ask  you. 
Whither  hath  fair  Andromache  bent  her  steps  from  the  palace? 
Went  she  to  one  of  my  sisters?  or  one  of  the  wives  of  my  brethren? 
Or  to  Athene"s  fane,  with  the  fair  hair'd  matrons  of  Troia, 
There  to  appease  with  prayer  the  wrath  of  the  terrible  goddess?"  (380) 

Thus  replied  the  chief  of  them  all,  the  diligent  housewife : 
"Since,  O  Hector,  thou  bidst  me  declare  the  truth  of  the  matter, 
Neither  to  one  of  thy  sisters,  nor  one  of  the  wives  of  thy  brethren, 
Nor  to  Athene's  fane  with  the  fair-hair'd  matrons  of  Troia, 
Went  she  to  join  with  the  rest  in  prayer  to  the  terrible  goddess. 
Up  to  the  watch-tow'r  high  she  went,  when  she  heard  that  the  Trojans 
Sorely  prest  gave  way,  and  Greece  in  her  strength  was  advancing. 
Wild  with  alarm  she  set  forth,  and  must  now  the  wall  be  ascending. 
Breathless  with  haste:  and  the  nurse  attends  her  bearing  her  infant." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  Hector  at  once  from  the  palace  departed,  (390) 
Hastening  back  through  the  stately  streets  by  the  way  he  had  entered. 
When  at  the  Scaean  gate  he  arrived,  having  traversed  the  city, 
Which  once  past,  his  path  led  straight  to  the  scene  of  the  combat, 
Came  his  rich-dower'd  wife  Andromache,  hurrying  to  meet  him, 
Great  Eetion's  daughter;  who  ruled  o'er  his  subject  Cilicians, 
Dwellers  in  fair  Hypoplakian  Thebe;  there  where  the  forests 
Feathering  down  Plakos'  slopes  yield  shade  and  shelter  and  verdure. 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  129 

(Such   was  the  lineage  of  her  who  had   Hector  the  brave  for  her 

husband). 
There  they  met;  and  the  nurse  was  nigh,  keeping  close  to  her  mistress, 
And  on  her  bosom  the  tender  babe,  sweet  pledge  of  their  union,  (400) 
Fair  as  a  radiant  star,  and  the  dearly  belov'd  of  his  parents. 
Him  had  his  father  Scamandrius  named,  but  the  rest  of  the  Trojans 
Called  him  Astyanax.     Troy's  deliv'rance  centered  in  Hector. 
Silent,  but  smiling,  he  gazed  on  the  lovely  boy,  and  beside  him 
Bitterly  weeping  Andromache  stood.     His  hand  she  had  taken; 
Holding  it  fondly  clasped,  and  endearingly  thus  she  addressed  him  : 
"Hector,  too  rashly  brave!     The  fire  of  thy  soul  will  destroy  thee. 
Pity  thou  feelest  none  for  thy  infant  son,  and  thy  consort, 
Soon  to  become  a  wretched  widow.     The  Greeks  will  o'erpow'r  thee, 
Setting  upon  thee  all  at  once.     For  me  were  it  better  (4TO) 

Then  to  be  whelmed  in  earth;  thou  lost!    What  joy  can  revisit 
Ever  this  desolate  heart  when  thou  art  gone?    For  the  future 
Nought  but  grief  will  be  mine.     No  father  have  I,  no  mother 
Honoured  and  loved.     My  father  was  slain  by  mighty  Achilles, 
When  our  Cilician  Thebe  fair  lay  smoking  in  ruin, 
Walls  and  lofty  gates.     Then  great  Eetion  perished. 
Yet  did  the  victor  spoil  not  the  dead,  for  he  honoured  his  mem'ry, 
Raised  him  a  funeral  pile,  and  in  all  his  panoply  burned  him, 
Marking '  the    spot  with  a  tomb ;   which   the  pitying  nymphs  of  the 

mountains, 
Daughters  of  Zeus,  with  a  grove  of  sacred  elms  have  encircled,     (420) 
Sev'n  dear  brothers  were  mine  in  the  ancient  home  of  my  parents : 
All  in   one  day  went  down  to  the  darksome  regions  of  Hades; 
All  by  the  godlike  might  of  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles 
Slain,  defending  their  herds  and  the  snowy  sheep  of 'their pastures. 
Only  my  royal  mother  remained,  brought  hither  a  captive, 
Far  from  her  lov'd  Hypoplakian  shades,  with  the  spoils  of  the  city. 
Ransomed  at  length  with  countless  wealth,  to  her  home  he  restored  her, 
Only  to  fall  by  Artemis'  shafts  in  the  halls  of  her  father. 
Still  thou  art  left  me.     To  me  thou  art  father,  mother,  and  brethren, 
Hector!     More  than  them  all:  my  heart's  first  love,   and  my  hus- 
band! (43°)

[Book  VI. 


Pity  me  then.     Here  stay,  here  take  thy  stand  on  the  rampart, 
Make  not  thy  son  an  orphan  :  thy  consort  make  not  a  widow. 
Near  yon  fig-tree  station  a  guard.     That  point  is  the  weakest, 
Easiest  scaled  its  wall  and  inviting  attack  on  the  city. 
Thrice  have  their  bravest  chiefs  attempted  it.     Both  the  Aiantes 
Tried  its  assault,  and  Idomeneus  far  renown'd ;  and  th'  Atreidae ; 
Tydeus'  warlike  son;  each  back'd  by  a  host  of  his  followers. 
Either  some  seer,  in  visions  warned,  had  drawn  their  attention, 
Or  their  own  keen  and  practised  glance  detected  its  weakness." 
Thus    then    the    lord   of  the    waving   plume,    great   Hector,    re- 
sponded: (440) 
"That   shall  have  all  my  care,   dear  wife!     But  shame  would  o'er- 

whelm  me, — 
How  could  I  face  the  Trojans  and  long-robed  matrons  of  Troia, 
If,  like  a  dastard,  I  shrank  aloof,  and  avoided  the  battle? 
Nor  could  my  soul  endure  it :  for  aye  have  I  learned  to  be  foremost; 
Valiantly  ever  to  dare,  and  fight  in  the  van  of  the  Trojans, 
Winning  renown  for  myself  and  my  father's  glory  upholding. 
Yet  in  my  heart  and  inmost  soul  too  surely  foreboding, 
Know  I,  and  feel,  that  the  day  must  come  when  Ilion  the  sacred, 
Priam,  and  all  the  brave  defenders  of  Priam,  shall  perish. 
Yet  among  all  these  woes  o'er  Troy  and  the  Trojans  impending,  (450) 
Not  for  my  mother  dear,  nor  the  sacred  head  of  my  father, 
Not  for  my  brethren,  num'rous  and  brave  as  they  are,  who  must  perish 
Slain,  and  trampled  in  dust  beneath 'the  feet  of  the  victor, 
Grieves  my  heart,  as  for  thee,  when  some  bronze-mailed  chief  of  the 

Grecians 
Weeping  shall  bear  thee  away ;  the  light  of  thy  freedom  extinguished ; 
Doomed  in  some  Argive  mansion  the  loom  to  ply  for  its  mistress, 
Water  from  Hypereia's  fount  to  bear,  or  Messei's, 
Sorr'wing  and  much  reluctant;  thy  soul  bowed  down  with  its  misery. 
Then  will  some  heartless  Greek,  thy  tears  beholding,  insult  thee: 
'This,'  will  he  say,  'is  Hector's  wife,  the  redoubtable  warrior,       (460) 
Bravest  of  all  the  Troian  chiefs,  the  defenders  of  Ilion.' 
Taunts  like  these  wrill  embitter  thy  grief  when  thou  think'st   upon 
Hector, 


Book  VI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  13 r 

Pow'rless  to  change  thy  doom,  or  avert  the  day  of  thy  bondage. 
Oh !  may  the  mounded  earth  lie  deep  on  my  corse  ere  I  hear  thee 
Shrieking  in  vain  for  help  in  the  ruthless  grasp  of  the  spoiler." 
HThus  having  said,  for  the  beauteous  boy  his  arms  he  extended  : 
Back  however  the  babe  with  a  scream  recoiled,  and  in  terror 
Clung  round  the  nurse's  neck;  for  he  feared  the  looks  of  his  father, 
Scared  by  the  glance  of  his  brazen  casque,  and  the  wave  of  the  horse-tail 
Dreadfully  nodding  aloft  in  the  crest  of  the  towering  helmet.   (470) 
Smiling,  his  terror  beheld  his  father  dear  and  his  mother. 
Then  from  his  head  the  mighty  Hector,  unfast'ning  his  helmet, 
Laid  it,  all  gleaming,  aside  on  the  ground.     Then  taking  the  infant, 
Fondly  kissed,  and  danced  him  awhile  in  his  hands :  and,  devoutly 
Praying  to  Zeus  and  th'  immortal  Gods,  preferred  his  petition  : 

"Grant,  O  Zeus,  and  ye  pow'rs  supreme,  that,  even  as  I  am 
So  distinguish'd  among  them  in  warlike  feats  and  in  valour, 
This  my  son  with  a  mighty  hand  may  rule  o'er  the  Trojans ! 
Grant  that,  returning  from  war,  having  slain  his  foemen  in  battle, 
Laden   with   blood-stained   spoils  and   the  heart   of  his   mother  re- 
joicing, (480) 
All  may  exclaim  'This  chief  is  greater  by  far  than  his  father.' "A 

Thus  he  spake,  and  placed  the  child  in  the  arms  of  his  mother. 
Smiling  through  tears  she  received,  and  folded  him  close  in  her  bosom, 
Fragrant  with  spicy  odours.     This  Hector  beheld,  and  in  pity 
Gently  caressing  his  weeping  wife  thus  fondly  addressed  her  : 

"Dearest!  grieve  not  thy  soul  with  over-anxious  forebodings. 
None,  ere  the  day  by  fate  decreed,  can  dismiss  me  to  Hades. 
Nor  hath  there  ever  been  man,  once  born,  who  his  fate  hath  eluded, 
Coward  or  brave !     All  sink  alike  whe?i  destiny  wills  it. 
Now  to  our  home  betake  thee.     Resume  the  cares  of  thy  house- 
hold, (49°) 
Look  to  the  distaff  and  web,  and  keep  thy  maids  to  their  duties, 
Each  to  her  task.     For  men  are  the  cares  of  war  and  its  labours; 
Mine  above  all  among  those  whom  Troy  sends  forth  in  her  armies." 

Thus  having  said,  great  Hector  resumed  his  glittering  helmet, 
Crested  and  plumed.     His  wife  all  sad  returned  to  her  palace, 
Casting  behind  her  many  a  look,  half  blinded  with  teardrops. 


132  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VI. 

Soon  as  the  stately  dome  of  the  death-doing  chief  she  had  entered, 

Num'rous  attendants  met  her,  and  flocked  around  to  receive  her. 

All  in  her  woe  partook,  all  echoed  the  moans  of  their  mistress, 

Raising  the  funeral  wail  for  their  living  lord  in  his  palace,       (500) 

Ezhi  as  already  dead :  for  none  expected  to  see  him 

Back  from  the  fight  return,  escaped  from  the  hands  of  the  Grecians. 

Paris  now  loitered  no  more  in  his  chambers  lofty  retirement ; 
But,  having  donned  in  haste  his  gorgeous  and  glittering  armour, 
Down  to  the  gate  he  strode  at  his  utmost  speed  through  the  city. 
As  when  a  courser,  high  fed,  and  exulting  in  pride  of  his  freedom, 
Bursting  the  rein  which  held  him  confined  to  his  stall,  o'er  the  meadows, 
Bounds  forth  prancing,  eager  to  lave  in  some  wide-flowing  river 
Well   rememberd — high   tossing  his   head,  while  the  mane  o'er  his 

shoulders 
Streams  on  the  wind,  away  he  darts  in  his  strength  and  his  beauty  (510) 
Far  o'er  the  plain,  in  the  distant  pastures  scenting  his  females : 
Thus  from  Pergamos'  loftiest  heights  rushed  down  Alexandras, 
Priamus'  son,  all  blazing  in  arms  like  the  sun  in  his  glory. 
Swiftly  his  feet  bore  him  on  exulting  ;  soon  he  encountered 
Godlike  HecTor  his  brother,  just  quitting  the  spot  where  so  lately 
Farewells  sad  with  his  wife  he  exchanged,  and  watched  her  departure. 
Thus  then  addressed  his  brother  the  godlike  Prince  Alexandros  : 

"Brother  belov'd  and  honour'd !  too  long  have  I  staid.  I  detain  thee, 
Hast'ning  away,  nor  have  duly  obeyed  the  command  that  thou  gav'st 
me." 

Crest-waving  Hector  thus  in  return  to  his  brother  responded:  (520) 
"  Pity  it  is,  since  none  can  with  justice  blame  thee  in  combat, 
None  can  deny  thy  valour,  when  once  engaged,  or  dispraise  thee, 
That  thou  shouldst  be  thus  tardy,  thus  hard  to  excite !   And  it  grieves 

me, 
Ev'n  to  my  inmost  soul,  to  hear  thee  reproached  by  the  Trojans, 
Those  who  so  bitterly  feel  the  woes  thy  conduct  hath  wrought  them. 
Now  let  us  hence.     No  more  of  this  till  the  day,  when  to  honour 
Zeus  and  the  immortal  pow'rs  who  rule  for  aye  in  Olympus, 
Freedom's  cup  in  our  halls  we  pledge :  when,  chased  from  among  us, 
Greece  and  her  bright-arm'd  hosts  these  shores  for  ever  abandon."

Argument. 


Helenus,  inspired  by  Apollo  and  Pallas,  recommends  Heclor  to 
challenge  the  bravest  of  the  Greeks  to  single  combat.  The  challenge  is  given, 
and,  after  some  hesitation,  accepted.  Lots  ar-e  cast  among  nine  chiefs  who 
come  forward,  to  decide  on  their  champion.  'The  choice  falls  o?i  Aias. 
The  heroes  fight,  somewhat  to  the  disadvantage  of  Heclor:  but  night 
coming  on  the  heralds  separate  the  combatants,  who  exchange  gifts.  By 
common  consent  a  truce  is  agreed  on  to  bury  the  dead,  the  Trojans  offering 
ternis  of  peace  which  Diomede  persuades  the  Greeks  to  rejecl.  The  dead 
are  burned  and  buried^  a?id  the  Greeks  dig  a  trench  and  erect  a  wall  round 
their  camp.

T  T  ECTOR  the  brave  having  spoken  thus,  rushed  forth  from  the  city : 
With  him  the  prince  Alexander  his  brother.  Both  were  impatient 
Once  more  to  join  the  ranks  of  war,  and  mix  in  the  struggle. 
As  to  some  toil-exhausted  crew,  o'er-labour'd  and  fainting, 
Painfully  urging  with  polish'd  oars  their  bark  through  the  ocean, 
Heav'n  at  their  prayer  accords  the  expected  and  favouring  Zephyr; 
Such  was  the  Trojans'  relief  at  the  long'd-for  sight  of  their  leaders. 
Each  from  the  Greeks  chose  forth  his  man.     Alexander  Menestheus 
Son  of  the  king  Areithous  slew,  stern  ruler  of  Arne, 
Lord  of  the  crushing  mace,  and  large-eyed  Philomedusa.  (10) 

Hector  Eioneus  smote  with  his  pointed  spear,  and  the  jav'lin 
Entered  his  neck  beneath  his  helm.     Down  sank  he  in  darkness. 
Glaucus,  Hippolochus'  son,  the  redoubted  Lycian  leader, 
Next,  in  fierce  encounter  Iphinous  pierced  through  the  shoulder, 
Dexias'  son,  in  the  act  of  vaulting  aloft  to  his  chariot, 
Drawn  by  two  fiery  mares.     He  fell,  and  his  spirit  forsook  him. 
This  when  the  blue-eyed  goddess  Athene  saw,  and  her  Grecians 
Perishing  thus  beheld  in  the  onset  fierce  of  their  foemen, 
Down  she  darted  on  sacred  Troy  from  the  heights  of  Olympus. 
This  when  Apollo  from  Pergamus  saw,  the  field  overlooking  (20) 

Anxious  for  Troy's  success,  he  arose  and  hastened  to  meet  her; 
And  at  the  Scaean  gate,  by  the  ancient  beech,  they  encountered. 
Thus  then  Apollo  divine,  Jove's  offspring,  accosted  the  goddess  : 


136  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VII. 

"Why  once  more,  O  daughter  of  mighty  Zeus,  from  Olympus 
Com'st  thou  hither,  excited  in  spirit,  and  eager  for  action? 
Is  it  to  favour  thy  Greeks  in  the  doubtful  turns  of  the  battle, 
Casting  all  pity  aside  and  care  for  the  perishing  Trojans? 
Yet  could  I  so  persuade  thee,  far  better  it  were  for  the  present, 
This  day  at  least,   to  appease    their  strife    and  restrain   them    from 

slaughter. 
Let  them  hereafter  renew  the  fight  if  they  will,  and  accomplish  (30) 
Ilion's  fall,  should  such  indeed  be  your  merciless  pleasure, 
Hera's  and  thine  that  this  fair  city  shall  sink  in  destruction." 

Thus  responded  in  turn  the  blue-eyed  goddess  Athene: 
"Ev'n  so  be  it,  far-darting  king.     To  this  end  from  Olympus 
Hither  I  came,  desiring  to  part  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans. 
Tell  me,  I  pray  thee,  how  dost  thou  purpose  to  stay  their  encounter?" 

Thus  in  his  turn  replied  Jove's  offspring,  kingly  Apollo  : 
"Let  us  excite  great  Hector,  the  warlike  tamer  of  horses, 
Forth  to  advance,  and  challenge  some  champion  bold  of  the  Grecians, 
Singly  and  hand  to  hand,  in  fierce  encounter  to  meet  him.        (40) 
So  shall  the  bronze-armed  Greeks,  by  his  words  provoked,  from  among 

them 
Choose  forth  a  warrior  worthy  to  cope  with  the  first  of  the  Trojans." 

Thus  he  spake :  and  the  blue-eyed  goddess  approved  the  proposal. 
Ilelenus,  Priam's  son,  meanwhile  perceiving  the  counsel 
In  his  prophetic  mind,  which  the  heav'nly  pair  had  adopted, 
Came,  and  his  stand  near  Hector  took,  and  thus  he  addressed  him : 

"Hector!  Priam's  iiiiconquered  son,  Jove's  equal  in  council! 
Wilt  thou  attend  to  my  words,  and  obey  the  voice  of  thy  brother? 
Bid  both  hosts  be  seated,  the  Trojans  and  Greeks  in  their  order, 
Thou  thyself  then  challenge  the   best  and  bravest  Achaian         (50) 
Singly  and  hand  to  hand  in  fierce  encounter  to  meet  thee. 
'Tis  not  thy  fate  to  fall  and  succumb  to  death  in  the  combat : 
This  from  the  Gods  I  know,  whose  voice  prophetic  has  reached  me." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  Hector  rejoiced  when  he  heard  the  proposal, 
Stepping  in  front  of  the  troops,  he  repressed  their  ranks  with  his  jav'lin 
Levelled  and  held  by  the  middle  athwart,  and  made  them  be  seated. 
So  Agamemnon  arranged  the  bright-greav'd  hosts  of  Achaia.

Pallas,  and  he  of  the  silver  bow,  far-darting  Apollo, 
Came,  and  like  vultures  in  form  sate  perched,  o'erlooking  the  armies 
High  on  a  lofty  beech  to  their  sire  the  Thunderer  sacred,         (60) 
Pleased  with  the  scene;  where  in  dense  array  the  heroes  in  order 
Blackened  the  plain,  all  bristling  with  spears,  with  shields,  and  with 

helmets. 
As  when  the  slumb'ring  breeze  begins  to  awake  and  a  ripple 
Steals  o'er  the  ocean's  breadth,  and  the  crispt  sea  darkens  beneath  it ; 
Thus  did  the  dense  compacted  lines  of  Greeks  and  of  Trojans 
Darken   the  plain.     Then  Hector  advanced  in  the  midst,  and  ad- 
dressed them: 
"Hear  and  attend  to  my  words,  ye  bright-greaved  Greeks  and  ye 
Trojans, 
While  unto  all  what  the  spirit  within  me  prompts  I  shall  utter. 
Zeus  where  he  sits  high-throned  hath  confounded  our  oaths  and  our 

treaty, 
Evil  devising  for  both,  and  ordains  our  strife  to  continue,  (70) 

Either  till  Troy's  high  tow'rs  and  walls  shall  yield  to  your  valour, 
Or  at  your  ships  yourselves  shall  strew  the  shore  with  your  corses. 
Here  I  behold  among  you  the  bravest  and  best  of  the  Grecians. 
If  there  be  one  with  daring  enough  to  meet  me  in  combat, 
Let  him  stand  forth  and  come  on,  as  a  champion  worthy  of  Hector. 
Hear  the  proposal  I  make,  and  to  this  let  Zeus  be  our  witness, 
If  to  his  spear's  long  reach  my  life  be  given,  let  the  victor 
Seize  on  my  arms  and  bear  them  away  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
But  be  my  body  restored,  that  our  Trojans  and  wives  of  the  Trojans 
On  the  funereal  pile  may  place  my  remains  and  consume  them.      (80) 
But  should  Apollo  the  glory  grant  me  to  slay  my  opponent, 
Mine  be  his  spoils.     I  shall  take,  and  to  sacred  Ilion  bear  them, 
There  to  adorn  the  temple  of  bright  far-darting  Apollo. 
Back  to  your  well-bench'd  ships  shall  his  corse  be  sent,  that  Achaia 
Funeral  rites  may  bestow,  and  a  tomb  be  raised  der  his  ashes 
On  the  wide  Hellespont's  sounding  shore  to  his  memory  sacred. 
Then  in  some  future  age,  when  men  shall  behold  it  in  passing, 
Borne  in  their  many-bench'd  ships  o'er  the  wine-dark  bosom  of  ocean, 
'There,'  shall  one  say  to  another,  'thou  see'st  the  tomb  of  a  hero 


133  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER,  [Book  VII. 

Bravely  fighting,  of  old,  who  fell  to  the  prowess  of  Hector :      (90) 
Thus  shall  he  speak,  and  thus  my  fame  undying  shall  flourish." 

Hector  thus.     No  word  in  reply  was  heard:  for  in  silence 
Shame  to  refuse,  and  dread  to  accept,  each  bosom  pervaded. 
Then  Menelaiis  at  length  uprose,  and,  groaning  in  spirit, 
Thus  he  rebuked  their  craven  fear  with  bitter  reproaches: 

"Women  of  Greece,  not  Greeks !  is  this  the  end  of  your  boasting? 
Shame  will  it  be,  most  shameful  and  grievous  to  bear,  when  in  future 
Fame  shall  tell  that  not  one  of  the  Greeks  would  confront  him  with 

Hector. 
Now  may  ye  all  to  water  and  earth  be  turned,  as  inaclive, 
Listless,  inglorious,  there  ye  sit,  and  gaze  011  each  other!  (IO°) 

I  myself  for  the  fight  will  adjust  mine  arms:  for  the  issue 
Rests  with  th'  immortal  Gods.     Be  it  conquest  or  death,  I  will  meet 
him." 

Thus  spake  the  chief,  and  resumed  his  bright  and  glittering  armour. 
Then,  Menelaiis!  thy  span  of  life  drew  nigh  to  its  ending, 
Forfeit  to  Hector's  hands;  since  Hector  by  far  was  the  mightier: 
Had  not  the  princes  of  Greece  in  alarm  upstarting  withheld  thee. 
Atreus'  son  himself,  the  wide-ruling  king  Agamemnon, 
Grasped  thy  right  hand  with  his  otvn,  and  named  thee  by  name,  and 
addressed  thee! 

"Sure  thou  art  mad,  Menelaiis  divine!     The  occasion  demands  not 
Frenzy  like  this.  Thy  zeal  repress,  though  dear  it  may  cost  thee,  (no) 
Fight  not,  for  fighting's  sake,  with  a  man  far  mightier  than  thou  art, 
Hector,  Priamus'  son,  whom  all  men  dread  to  encounter. 
Mighty  Achilles  himself,  a  braver  chief  and  a  stronger, 
Hector's  assault  hath  been  known  to  dread,  and  avoid  him  in  battle. 
Now  be  advised.     Resume  thy  seat  among  thy  companions, 
Greece  will  provide  her  a  champion  meet  to  fight  in  her  quarrel. 
Brave  as  he  is  and  greedy  of  war  and  fighting,  believe  me 
Glad  will  he  be  to  rest  when  the  struggle  is  o'er  which  awaits  him, 
Should  he  escape  with  life  from  the  fierce  and  deadly  encounter." 

Thus  spake  th'  heroic  chief,  dissuading  the  mind  of  his  brother:  (120) 
Good  was  his  counsel  and  well  received :  and  his  joyful  attendants 
Eagerly  lent  their  aid  to  divest  their  prince  of  his  armour.

Then  in  the  midst  of  the  Greeks  old  Nestor  rose  and  addressed 

them  : 
"Gods!  what  a  weight  of  woe  descends  on  the  sons  of  Achaia! 
How  will  that  ancient  knight,  great  Peleus,  grieve  when  he  hears  it, 
He,  the  adviser  sage  of  the  Myrmidon  race,  and  their  sovereign, 
Who  with  such  close  and  earnest  enquiry  erst  in  his  palace 
Made  me  recount  each  Grecian  chief,  his  lineage  and  offspring : 
How  will  he  raise  his  feeble  hands  to  the  blessed  immortals, 
Praying  release  for  his  soul,  and  rest  in  the  mansions  of  Hades,    (130) 
When  he  shall  learn  how  low  they  crouch  at  the  menace  of  Hector. 
Would  but,  O  Father  Zeus,  and  Apollo,  and  Pallas  Athena! 
Would  I  were  young  once  more,  as  on  Celadon's  banks,  where  the 

Pylians, 
Gathering  around  me,  fought  with  the  bold  Arcadian  spearmen; 
Or  'neath  the  Phaean  walls,  by  the  rushing  Iardanus  watered. 
There  stood  forth  Ereuthalion,  godlike  man,  as  their  champion, 
Sheath'd  in  resplendent  armour,  the  spoils  of  king  Areithoiis, 
Great  Areithoiis,   sprung  from  a  race  divine;  Corynetes 
Called,  as  a  surname  giv'n  him  alike  by  men  and  by  women: 
For   that,    rejecting   the    bow   and    the    spear's    long   reach   in   the 

battle,  (I4°) 

Wielding  a  mace  of  steel,  he  crushed  the  ranks  of  his  foemen. 
Him,  fair  combat  avoiding,  Lycurgus  slew,  at  advantage 
Ta'en  in  a  narrow  defile,  where  the  sweep  of  his  mace  might  avail  him 


Nought,  to  secure  his  life:  for,  ere  he 


could  raise  it,  Lycurgus 
and    supine    he   fell  in 


his 


Pierced   him    through   with   his    spear, 

death-pang. 
Thus  these  arms  did  he  win.     As  a  gift  from  Ares  he  prized  them, 
WTorn  by  himself  thenceforth,  in  many  a  martial  encounter. 
But  when  by  age  unnerved  and  at  length  confined  to  his  palace, 
Brave  Ereuthalion  received  them,  his  lov'd  and  faithful  attendant. 
These  were  the  arms  he  wore  when  he  challenged  the  boldest  among 

us.  (15c) 

All  then  trembled  with  fear,  nor  did  one  dare  venture  to  meet  him. 
I,  however,  the  youngest  of  all,  by  the  spirit  excited, 
Burning  within  me,  to  fight  him,  and  filled  with  confident  valour 


140  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VII. 

Met  him,  and  smote  him.     Pallas  sustained,  and  to  victory  led  me. 
Huge  as  he  was,  I  slew  that  bold  and  redoubtable  hero. 
Wide  outstretched  on  the  cumber 'd  plain  lay  the  limbs  of  the  giant. 
Could  I  renew  that  youth — could  strength  like  that  be  restored  me, 
Crest-waving  Hector  would  wait  not  long  for  a  fitting  opponent. 
Yet,  while  around  me  I  see  the  bravest  and  best  of  the  Grecians, 
None  stands  forward  in  arms  to  cope  with  this  terrible  Hector."   (160) 

Nestor  reproving  them  thus,  up  started  nine  of  the  heroes. 
First  and  foremost  by  far  was  the  wide-ruling  prince  Agamemnon, 
Next  in  order  came  brave  Tydeus'  son  Diomedes, 
Then  too  uprose  th'  Aiantes  both,  in  the  pride  of  their  valour; 
Next  came  Idomeneus,  Merion   next  his  constant  companion, 
Charged  with  the  care  of  his  arms,  and  the  rival  of  Ares  in  battle ; 
Next  Eurypylus,  valiant  son  of  noble  Evsemon, 
Thoas,   Andraemon's  son,  and  the  godlike  might  of  Odysseus  : 
All  prepared  for  the  fight — all  eager  to  match  them  with  Hector. 
Then  the  Gerenian  knight  old  Nestor  sagely  advised  them:  (I7°) 

"Now  then  decide  by  impartial  lot  which  chief  shall  be  chosen, 
Much  will  he  aid  our  cause,  and  well  deserve  of  the  Grecians, — 
Great  to  himself  the  glory  and  gain,  if  back  from  the  conflict 
Unsubdued  he  return,  unscathed  in  the  dreadful  encounter." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  each  chief  prepared  his  lot.     Having  marked  it 
Into  the  helm  he  cast  it  of  Atreus'  son  Agamemnon. 
Then  to  the  gods,  with  hands  and  with  eyes  uplifted  to  Heaven, 
Thus  might  you  hear  the  people  in  prayer  their  wishes  expressing  : 
"Father  Zeus!  O   choose  for  us  Aias,  or  noble  Tydeides, 
Or  be  the  lot  conferred  on  the  sov'reign  of  wealthy  Mycense."      (180) 

Thus  they  prayed.     Then  shook  the  lots  Gerenian  Nestor. 
Forth  from  the   helmet  leaped  that  lot  so  earnestly  wished  for, 
That  which  the  mark  of  Aias  bore.     This  raising,  the  herald, 
Handed  it  round  from  right  to  left  to  the  chiefs  of  the  Grecians, 
Each  in  his  turn  disclaimed  the  mark  unknown.     But  the  herald, 
Making  his  way  through  the  crowd,  at  the  place  arrived  where  the 

hero, 
He  who  had  marked  and  giv'n  it,  stood.     The  illustrious  Aias 
Stretched  forth  his  hand  for  the  lot,  and  the  herald  handed  it  to  him. 


BOOK  VII.J  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMEE.  141 

Aias  no  sooner  saw  than  he  knew  his  mark,  and  exultant 

Cast  the  lot  on  the  ground  at  his  feet,  and  addressed  the  Achaians :  (190) 

"See,  my  friends!  the  lot  is  mine  own!  I  receive  it  rejoicing. 
Full  and  assured  is  my  trust  the  godlike  Hector  to  conquer. 
All,  howbeit,  while  my  limbs  I  invest  in  their  glittering  armour, 
Pray  to  almighty  Zeus,   the  immortal  offspring  of  Kronos, 
In  my  behalf.     But  in  silence  pray  lest  the  Trojans  should  hear  you. 
Said  I  in  silence?     Aloud  if  ye  will.      What  need  we  concealment? 
Fear  have  we  none.     By  force  alone  shall  no  mortal  subdue  me : 
Nor,  as  I  trust,   by  skill;    or  vainly  in  arms  was  I  nurtured, 
In  rough  Salamis  born,  and  trained  to  the  use  of  my  weapons? 

Thus  he  spake,  and  all  then  prayed  to  mighty  Kronion,       (200) 
Uttering  words  like  these,  with  eyes  uplifted  to  Heaven  : 
"Father  Zeus  most  great,  most  glorious,  ruling  from  Ida! 
Victory  grant  to  Aias,  and  crown  his  achievements  with  glory ; 
Yet  if  thou  favour  Hector,  and  grant  him  thy  mighty  protection, 
Give  to  them  equal  force,  and  divide  the  glory  between  them." 

Thus  while  they  prayed  great  Aias  assumed  his  glittering  armour; 
And,  in  refulgent  bronze  when  his  mighty  form  was  invested, 
Forth  to  the  field  he  rushed;  as  gigantic  Ares  to  battle 
Stalks  when  he  mingles  in  fight  with  heroes  whom  angry  Kronion 
Plunges  in  soul-consuming  strife  and  bitter  contention.  (2I°) 

Thus  did  gigantic  Aias,  the  bulwark  and  strength  of  the  Grecians, 
Grimly  smiling,  advance  to  the  fight:  each   stride  of  the  warrior 
Cov'ring  a  length  of  ground,  with  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin, 
Poised  in  his  grasp.     And  the  Greeks  rejoiced  when  they  gazed  on 

their  champion: 
Trembled  in  every  limb  the  fear-struck  ranks  of  the  Trojans. 
Hector  himself  for  a  moment  perceived  in  his  bosom  a  flutter. 
All  retreat,  however,  was  barred,  all  thought  of  withdrawing, 
Lost  in  the  crowd  of  his  friends;  for  himself  had  offered  the  challenge. 
Aias  approached,  advancing  his  mighty  shield  like  a  tower 
Brazen,  with  sev'n-fold   hides.      This    Tychius  the  artist  had  made 
him  (220) 

(Tychius,  the  foremost  man  of  his  craft,  a  dweller  in  Hyle), 
Easily  wielded  by  Aias,  though  sev'n  huge  bulls  had,  to  make  it, 


142  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VII. 

Yielded  their  hides,  and  a  plating  of  brass  completed  the  fabric. 

Cov'ring  his  form  with  this,  the  great  Telamonian  Aias 

Close  up  to  Hector  advanced,  and   threat'ning   thus   he   addressed 

him  : 
"Hector!  now  art  thou  matched,  and  man  to  man  shalt  discover 
What  sort  of  warriors  are  those  who  lead  our  hosts  of  Achaia. 
What  though  the  breaker  of  ranks,  the  lion-hearted  Achilles, 
Holds  him  aloof,  by  his  high-beak'd  ships,  remote  and  inactive, 
Wroth  against  Atreus'  son,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people:  (230) 
Others  there  are,  and  many  amongst  us,  able  to  meet  thee, 
Aye,  and  perchance  to  conquer.    Come  on  then!    Begin  we  the  battle." 

Thus  then  crest-waving  Hector,  the  mighty  in  battle,  responded : 
"Aias  divine!  great  Telamon's  son,  and  the  pride  of  thy  nation! 
Threat  not  me  as  thou  wouldst  some  inexperienced  stripling, 
Or  some  woman,  unversed  in  war  and  the  conduct  of  battles. 
Fighting,  and  slaying  of  men,  are  to  me  nor  new  nor  alarming. 
Shifting  my  shield  now  right,  now  left,  I  know  to  protect  me. 
Weariness  visits  not  me  in  the  long-drawn  stress  of  the  combat. 
Skilled  are  my  feet  in  each  measured  step  of  the  dances  of  Ares,  (240) 
Or  with  the  foot  to  advance,  or  join  in  the  rush  of  the  chariots. 
Brave  as  thou  art,  unawares  no  weapon  of  mine  shall  assail  thee, 
Stand  011  thy  guard!     This  fairly  is  thrown,  and  I  trust  thou  shalt 
feel  it." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  hurled  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin. 
Full  on  the  mighty  sev'n-fold  shield  of  Aias  it  lighted ; 
Piercing  the  shining  brass,  its  eighth  and  outermost  cov'ring, 
Passed   with  unblunted  force  through  six  tough  hides,  and   beyond 

them 
Met,  and  at  length  stuck  fast  in  the  sev'nth.    Then  next  in  succession 
Aias  divine  sent  forth  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin, 
Full  on  the  smooth  round  shield  of  the  son  of  Priam  it  lighted,     (250) 
Thorough  the  shining  bronze  it  forced  its  impetuous  passage, 
Then  through  the  corslet  rich  its  course  pursued,  and  descending, 
Glanced  by  his  flank  aside;  and  his  vest  was  torn  by  the  weapon; 
Swerving,  however,  with  dext'rous  skill  black  death  he  eluded. 
Tugging  amain  with  both  their  hands  they  recovered  their  weapons, 


Book  VI  I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  143 

Then  in  close  fight  they  joined,  like  raw-devouring  lions, 
Or  as  two  mighty  forest  boars  each  rending  the  other. 
Full  on  the  midst  of  Aias'  shield  the  weapon  of  Hector 
Struck,  but  it  entered  not,  and  the  point  fell  blunted  and  harmless. 
Aias  came  on  with  a  bound,  and  smote  his  shield,  and  the  impulse  (260) 
Stopped  his   career  and   repelled   him.     The    spear   passed   straight 

through  his  buckler, 
Cutting  his  neck  beyond;  and  the  dark  blood  flowed  in  a  torrent. 
Tossing  his  lofty  crest  as  in  scorn  of  the  hurt,  to  the  combat 
Hector  again  returned.     A  stone  he  perceived,  and  he  raised  it 
Up  from  the  plain  where  embedded  it  lay,  black,  rugged,  and  massive. 
This  on  the  mighty  sev'n-fold  shield  he  dashed ;  and  it  lighted 
Full  on  the  central  boss;  and  the  brass  rang  loudly  beneath  it. 
Aias  then  in  his  turn  a  much  heavier  fragment  uplifted, 
Huge  as  the  nether  block  of  a  mill,  and  swinging  it  round  him, 
Using  enormous  strength,  broke  through  the  buckler  of  Hector,  (270) 
Crushing  his  knee.      And  supine  he  fell,  by  the  shield  all  in  fragments 
Bruised   and    o'erwhelmed.     But   Apollo   restored    his    strength   and 

upraised  him. 
Then  in  yet  closer  fight,  with  their  swords,  had  the  heroes  encountered, 
Had  not  the  heralds,  messengers  holy  of  Gods  and  of  mortals, 
Now"  intervened ;  Talthybius  the  wise,  Idaeus  the  prudent, 
This  for  the  Trojans,  that  for  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia. 
Stretching  between  them  their  sceptres  they  parted  the  chiefs;  and 

Idaeus 
Thus  delivered  their  sage  resolves  and  counsels  of  prudence: 
"Fight  no  longer,  my  children!  7-etwn your  swords  to  their  scabbards, 
Dear  alike  are  ye  both  to  cloud-compelling  Kronion  :  (280) 

Each,  as  we  all  have  seen,  is  a  champion  brave,  and  a  warrior. 
Night  is  at  hand.     To  obey  the   night  is  the  duty  of  all  men." 

Answ'ring  Idaeus,  thus  then  spake  Telamonian  Aias  : 
"Words  like  these,  if  it  please  him,  let  Hector  speak,  at  thy  bidding. 
His  was  the  challenge,  proffered  to  all  the  chiefs  of  the  Grecians, 
Let  him  begin.     I  obey  thy  words  if  he  set  the  example." 

Thus  then  the  lord  of  the  waving  plume,  great  Hector,  addressed 

him : 


144  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VII. 

"Aias!  the  Gods  have  giv'n  thee  stature  and  strength.     They  have 

giv'n  thee 
Wisdom,  and  skill  beyond  all  the  Greeks  in  the  use  of  thy  weapon ; 
Therefore  desist  we  now  from  fight  and  angry  contention,        (290) 
This  day  at  least.     When  we  fight  it  out  on  some  future  occasion 
Heav'n  will  decide  between  us,  and  crown  the  victor  with  glory. 
Night  is  at  hand.     To  obey  the  night  is  the  duty  of  all  men. 
So  shalt  thou  gladden  the  Greeks,  at  their  ships,  who  greet  thy  returning : 
All  thy  companions  in  arms,  and  all  thy  friends  who  surround  thee. 
I  too  returning  again  to  the  lofty  city  of  Priam 
Joy  shall  bring  to  the  Trojans,  and  long-robed  matrons  of  Troia 
All  at  this  moment  engaged  in  prayer  and  solemn  procession. 
Yet.  ere  we  part,  exchange  we  costly  gifts  with  each  other. 
So  shall  our  friends,  in  either  host,  when  they  speak  of  our  combat,   (300) 
Say,  'Those  chiefs  who  met  in  such  fierce  and  bitter  contention 
Learned  to  respecl  each  other's  worth,  and  parted  in  friendship.'" 
Thus  having  said  he  presented  a  sword,  bright  hilted  with  silver, 
Which  with  the  sheath  and  broidered  belt  he  handed  to  Aias, 
Who,  on  his  part,  a  baldric  gave  resplendent  with  purple. 
Both  then  retired;  the  one  to  rejoin  the  host  of  the  Grecians, 
Back  to  the  crowd  of  Trojans  the  other.     These,  when  they  met  him, 
Greatly  rejoiced  to  behold  him,  alive  returned,  and  in  safety- 
Unsubdued  by  the  giant  force  of  invincible  Aias : 
More  than  they  dared  to  hope:  and  with  shouts  to  the  city  they  led 

him.  (310) 

Aias  the  while,  triumphant,  the  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia 
Brought,  as  if  victor  in  fight  declared  to  divine  Agamemnon. 

Now  to  Atreides'  tent  were  they  come,  and  the  chiefs  were  assembled ; 
There  at  the  King's  command  was  a  steer  led  up  to  the  altar, 
Five  years  old,  and  a  male,  for  the  son  of  mysterious  Kronos 
This  they  flayed,  and  the  carcase  dressed,  and  the  limbs  they  divided, 
Cut  into  portions  the  flesh,  transfixed  and  skilfully  roasted, 
Drew  them  from  off  the  spits,  and  served  them  for  meat  at  the  tables. 
Thus  was  the   meal   prepared,   and  the  banquet   spread;   and  they 

feasted 
Each  to  his  soul's  content :  nor  lacked  they  abundance  or  welcome.  (320) 


Book  VI I .]  THE  ILIA  D  OF  HOMER.  1 45 

* 

Atreus'  heroic  son,  the  wide-ruling  prince  Agamemnon, 
Ordered  the  length  entire  of  the  chine  to  be  set  before  Aias. 
But  when  the  cravings  of  hunger  and  thirst  at  length  were  abated, 
Nestor,  ever  the  first  to  unfold  the  counsels  of  wisdom, 
Ever  the  most  approved  by  all,  uprose  to  advise  them. 
Sagely  he  spoke,  and   these   were  the  words  he  addressed   to  the 
princes : 

"Mighty  Atreides !    And  you,  ye  leaders  renown' d  of  the  Grecians, 
Many,  too  many,  have  fall'n  of  the  long-hair'd  sons  of  Achaia, 
Mingling  their  purple  blood  with  the  wide-rolling  stream  of  Scamander 
At  stern  Ares'  behest.    And  their  souls  have  descended  to  Hades.  (330) 
Bid  thou  the  Greeks  with  to-morrow's  dawn  desist  from  their  warfare. 
Bid  them  collect  their  dead,  and  with  mules,  with  oxen,  and  chariots 
Bring  them  together,  somewhat  apart  from  the  vessels,  and  burn  them. 
So  shall  each  man  preserve  the  bones  of  his  friends,  and  convey  them 
Back  to  their  native  land,  when  fate  shall  ordain  our  departure. 
Then  be  a  mound  heaped  up  on  the  site  of  the  pyre — a  memorial 
Common  to  all :  and  commencing  thence,  be  a  wall  and  a  rampart 
Built  with  all  speed,  with  lofty  tow'rs,  to  serve  as  a  bulwark 
Both  to  our  ships  and  ourselves.     And  let  gates  be  made  for  our 

chariots 
Forth  to  proceed  for  war,  well  barred,  and  strongly  protected.     (340) 
Outside,  dig  we  a  trench  profound,  surrounding  the  rampart; 
This  shall  avail  to  protect  both  horses  and  men,  should  the  Trojans 
Press,  elate  with  their  brief  success,  too  closely  upon  us." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  princes  all  approved  his  proposal. 
Meanwhile,  in  Troy  was  held  a  confused  and  distracted  assembly, 
Gathered  on  Pergamos'  height,  at  the  gates  of  the  palace  of  Priam. 
Sage  Antenor  took  up  the  word,  and  thus  he  harangued  them: 

"Hear  me,  ye  Trojans,  Dardans,  and  faithful  allies  of our  city  / 
While  I  declare  unto  all  what  the  soul  in  my  bosom  commands  me. 
Act  as  becomes  your  fa??ie.     Restore  at  once  to  th'  Atreidas      (350) 
Argive  Helen  and  all  her  treasures.     Are  we  not  fighting 
Under  the  ban  of  broken  oaths?     What  better  can  happen, 
What  success  we  can  hope,  I  see  not :  if  this  be  rejected." 

Thus  having  said  he  resumed  his  seat.     Then  rose  to  address  them 


10 


i46  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VII. 

Fair-hair'd  Helena's  spouse,  the  godlike  prince,  Alexandros, 
Who  in  these  ardent  words  replied,  giving  vent  to  his  anger: 
"Sore  displeasing,  An  tenor,  to  me  are  the  words  thou  hast  uttered ; 
Well  dost  thou  know  far  better  and  wiser  counsel  to  offer. 
If  thou  be  serious,  indeed,  and  this  thy  deliberate  meaning, 
Truly,  methinks,  th'  immortal  Gods  have  deprived  thee  of  reason.  (360) 
I,  in  my  turn,  have  a  word  to  speak  to  the  horse-taming  Trojans, 
Once  for  all,  I  declare  it — my  wife  will  I  never  relinquish. 
As  for  the  treasure— all  that  from  Argos  I  brought  unto  Ilion 
Ready  am  I  to  restore,  and  with  wealth  of  my  own  to  augment  it." 

This  having  said  he  resumed  his  seat.  Then  rose  to  address  them 
Priamus,  Dardanus'  son,  superior  to  mortals  in  wisdom. 
Sagely  he  spake,  and  these  were  the  words  he  addressed  to  the  meeting : 
"Hear  me,  ye  Trojans,  Dardans,  and  faithful  allies  of  our  city! 
While  I  declare  to  all  what  the  soul  in  my  bosom  commands  me : 
First,  as  in  usual  course,  let  food  be  served  to  the  army.  (370) 
Post  strong  guards   for   the   night,  and   be  each  man  watchful  and 

ready. 
Then,  with  to-morrow's  dawn,  let  Idaeus  proceed  to  their  vessels, 
Let  him  report  Alexandros'  words  on  the  cause  of  our  quarrel 
Unto  th'  Atreidse  both,  Menelaiis  and  king  Agamemnon. 
Let  him  moreover  a  truce  demand  from  war  and  its  uproar, 
Prudently  wording  his  message :  that  so  to  the  slain  may  be  granted 
Funeral  rites.     This  done,  when  again  we  shall  mingle  in  conflict, 
Heav'n  will  decide  between  us,  and  crown  the  victors  with  glory." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  to  all  he  said  the  people  assented. 
Food  was  distributed  then  to  the  troops,  assembled  by  sections.  (380) 
Morning  dawned,  and  Idseus  sought  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Where,  by  the  stern  of  Atreides'  ship,  he  found  them  assembled, 
Ready  alike  for  council  and  deeds  of  arms :  and  amidst  them 
Taking  his  stand,  the  clear-voiced  herald  delivered  his  message: 
"O  ye  Atreidse,  and  all  ye  distinguished  chiefs  of  the  Grecians, 
Priam  hath  sent  me  hither,  and  Troy's  illustrious  leaders, 
Bidding  me  speak  what  perchance  may  well  deserve  your  attention ; 
What  Alexander  himself,  the  cause  of  our  quarrel,  proposes. 
All  the  treasures  he  brought  to  Troy  when  he  quitted  your  country, 


Book  VII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  147 

Crossing  the    sea    with    his    ships   (Oh,   would   that   first   he   had 
perished!),  (390) 

These  will  he  freely  restore,  and  with  wealth  of  his  own  will  aug- 
ment them. 
Not  so  Helen,  the  youthful  spouse  of  great  Menelaiis  ; 
Her  will  he  never  yield,  though  greatly  the  Trojans  desire  it. 
Further,  I  come  commissioned  a  truce  from  war  and  its  uproar 
In  fair  words  to  demand;  that  so  to  the  slain  may  be  granted 
Funeral  rites.     This  done,  if  again  we  mingle  in  conflict, 
Heav'n  will  decide  between  us,  and  crown  the  victors  with  glory." 

Thus  he  spake:  and  all  received  the  proposal  in  silence. 
Brave  Diomedes  at  length  uprose  and  declared  his  opinion: 
"Neither  the  treasure,  nor  Helen  herself,  let  a  man  of  the  Grecians  (400) 
Think  of  accepting.     Surely  a  child  may  see  that  destruction 
Hovers  o'er  Ilion's  walls,  and  that  nought  can  save  her  from  ruin." 

Ended  the  chief,  and  shouted  assent  the  sons  of  Achaia, 
All  the  decisive  words  of  stern  Diomedes  approving. 
Then  Agamemnon  the  king  thus  spake,  addressing  Idseus: 

"Now,  thou  hast  heard,  Idseus,  how  Greece  receives  thy  proposal. 
Go!  report  her  reply — and  add,  Agamemnon  approves  it. 
But,  as  regards  the  dead,  I  refuse  not  permission  to  burn  them. 
Grudge  bear  we  none  to  the  slain,  nor  war  with  inanimate  corses. 
Fall'n,  let  the  last  sad  rite  be  in  haste  performed,  to  appease  them.  (410) 
So  be  it!  witness  it,  thundering  Zeus,  thou  consort  of  Hera!" 
Thus  as  he  spake,  to  the  pow'rs  on  high  he  uplifted  his  sceptre. 

Back  Idseus  returned  to  the  sacred  city  of  Ilion, 
Where  both  Trojans  and  Dard&amp;ns  he  found  assembled  in  council 
Ev'n  as  he  left  them,  waiting  to  hear  the  result  of  his  mission. 
Straightway  advancing  among  them  he  stood,  and  delivered  his  message 
Full  in  the  midst  of  all:  and  without  delay  they  proceeded, 
Some  to  collect  the  bodies,  and  some  for  wood  to  consume  them. 
Nor  with  less  anxious  zeal  went  forth  the  Greeks  from  their  vessels, 
Gath'ring  together  their  dead  and  collecting  the  fuel  to  burn  them.  (420) 

Bright  o'er  the  freshen' d  fields  was  the  sun  in  his  glory  ascending 
Into  the  clear  expanse;  o'er  the  smooth  and  deep-flowing  ocean 
Shedding  a  holy  calm.     Then  met  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans 


148  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VII. 

Seeking  their  friends,  disfigured  with  wounds  and  hard  to  distinguish. 
Off  with  water  they  washed  the  clotted  gore,  and  upraised  them, 
Many  a  warm  tear  dropping  the  while;  and  laid  them  on  chariots. 
Priam  allowed  no  clamorous  woe.     But  inwardly  grieving, 
Silent  they  heaped  their  dead  on  the  mighty  pyre  and  consumed  them. 
Sadly  and  slow,  the  rite  performed,  they  returned  to  the  city. 
Nor  with  less  pious  care  did  the  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia   (430) 
Heap  on  the  pile  their  dead,  and  burn  them  with  fire,  and  departing 
Sorrowing  and  slow,  the  rite  performed,  return  to  their  vessels. 

Thus  passed  the  mournful  day.      With  the  morrow's  dawn  in  the 
twilight 
Issued  a  chosen  band  of  Greeks.     The  pyre  they  surrounded, 
Heaping  upon  it  a  mighty  mound  from  the  plain,  a  ?nemorial 
Common  to  all;  and  commencing  thence,  a  wall  and  a  rampart    • 
Speedily  built,  with  lofty  towers,  to  serve  as  a  bulwark 
Both  for  their  ships  and  themselves.     And   a  gate   they  made   for 

the  chariots 
Forth  to  the  war  to  proceed,  well  barred  and  strongly  protected. 
Outside  of  all  a  trench  they  dug  surrounding  the  rampart       (440) 
Broad  and  profound,  and  sharp  palisades  they  planted  within  it. 

Thus  did  the  long-hair'd  Greeks  with  toil  complete  their  defences. 
All  the  Gods  meanwhile,  around  Zeus,  dread  wielder  of  lightning, 
Sate,  admiring  the  mighty  work   of  the  bronze-mail'd  Achaians. 
Then  Poseidon,   earth-shaking  pow'r,  uprose  and  addressed  him: 
"Father  Zeus!  doth  a  man  on  the  wide  earth's  measureless  surface 
Live,  who  henceforth  will  open  his  heart  to  the  blessed  immortals? 
See!  what  a  length  of  wall  these  long-hair'd  sons  of  Achaia 
Round    their    ships   have   built!    what    a   trench   ihey   have   made! 
what  a  rampart!  (449) 

All  in  the  pride  of  their  hearts:  nor  prayers  nor  hecatombs  offered ! 
Wide  as  the  dawn's  broad  light  will  this  work's  fame  be  extended, 
That  which  Phoebus  and  I  performed  of  old  be  forgotten, 
That  we  so  toilsomely  raised  round  great  Laomedon's  city." 

Grievously  anger'd,  Zeus,  the  cloud-compeller,  responded: 
"Lord  of  the  earthquake's  might!     What  words  are  these  thou  hast 
uttered? 


Book  VII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  149 

Thoughts  like  these  might  disturb  some  feebler  pow'r  of  Olympus, 
Much  thy  inferior  in  strength,  and  much  less  wide  in  dominion. 
Far  as  the  day-spring  shines  thy  fame  will  for  aye  be  extended. 
As  for  this  wall  which  excites  thy  wrath:  when  the  sons  of  Achaia 
Back    to    their    dear-lov'd   land    are    returned,    thou    hast    but    to 

whelm  it  (460) 

Deep  in  thy  seas,  uptearing  it  all'  from  its  lowest  foundations ; 
Spreading  thy  sands  once  more  o'er  the  broad  flat  beach  it  disfigures. 
So  shall  no  trace  remain  of  this  wond'rous  work  of  the  Grecians." 

Thus  discoursed  the  immortal  Gods  in  the  halls  of  Olympus. 
Set,    meanwhile,   was   the    sun,  and   the   work   of  the    Greeks   was 

completed. 
Oxen  were  slain,  and  beneath  their  tents  a  repast  was  provided. 
Wine,  in  many  a  ship  from  Lemnos'  isle,  by  Euneus, 
Son  of  the  prince  Iason,  whom  fair  Hypsipyle  bore  him, 
Sent,  from  his  plenteous  stores,  was  ready  at  hand  in  abundance. 
Thence    had    been    landed    a    thousand    measures    of  wine,    from 

Euneus,  (47°) 

Sent,  as  a  royal  gift,  apart,  to  the  brother  Atreidae. 
Thence,  too,  the  long-hair'd  Greeks  drew  large  supplies;  which  they 

purchased, 
Some  with  brass,  and  others  with  shining  steel,  or  with  oxen; 
Some  with  their  hides,  and  some  with  captive  slaves.     And  provision 
Lacked  not,  largely  prepared  for  all  the  hosts  of  Achaia. 
All  night  long  they  feasted,  and  all  night  long  in  the  city 
Feasted  the  Troian  hosts,  and  the  faithful  allies  of  the  Trojans. 
High  over-head  meanwhile  through  the  night  loud  thunder  was  pealing, 
Sign  of  an  angry  god.     And  pale  was  each  visage  with  terror. 
Each  man  poured  on  the  ground  some   wine   from   his    cup.     By 

libations  (480) 

Zeus  unappeased,  none  dared  advance  his-  lips-  to  the  goblet. 
Wearied    at    length    they   reclined,    and    enjoyed    the    blessing    of 

slumber.

Zeus  convenes  the  Gods  on  Oly77ipus,  and  forbids  them  to  aid  either  of 
the  contending  armies.  Retiring  to  Ida,  he  hangs  out  the  scales  of  destiny, 
and  conformably  to  their  indication  darts  his  lightnings  on  the  Greeks. 
Nestor,  one  of  whose  horses  is  killed,  mounts  the  car  of  Diomede,  and

F\AWN,  in  his  saffron  mantle  clad,  the  earth  had  illumined, 

When,  on  the  loftiest  of  all  the  bristling  peaks  of  Olympus, 
Thundering  Zeus  an  assembly  convened  of  the  blessed  immortals. 
Thus  he  addressed  them,  list'ning  all  with  breathless  attention: 

"Hear  me,  ye  Gods  and  Goddesses  all,  blest  pow'rs  of  Olympus  I 
While  unto  each  I  declare  what  the  soul  in  my  bosom  commands  me. 
This,  my  word,  no  God  of  you  all,  be  he  male,  be  she  female, 
Venture  to  contravene;  but  assent  at  once  and  obey  me: 
So  shall  I  quickly  bring  this  long  dispute  to  an  issue. 
Whomsoe'er  of  the  Gods  I  shall  see  going  forth,  with  intention,     (10) 
Or  to  the  Greek  or  the  Trojan  cause  to  render  assistance, 
Smitten  and  sore  disgraced  that  God  shall  return  to  Olympus ; 
Or  into  Tartarus'  gloomy  gulph  it  may  please  me  to  hurl  him 
Far  from  hence,  where  deep  under  ground  a  horrible  dungeon 
Yawns.     Its  gates  are  of  steel,  its  threshold  brass.     Beneath  Hades 
Deeper  it  lies  and  further  down  than -earth  from  the  heavens. 
So  shall  he  learn  how  far  my  might  all  other  surpasses. 
Come  now,  ye  Gods !  make  trial  of  strength,  that  all  may  behold  it : 
Down  will  I  cast  from  heaven  a  golden  chain,  and  support  it. 
Thereby,  ye  Gods  and  Goddesses  all  suspended,  endeavour       (20) 
Down  from  Olympus  to  earth  to  drag  your  Lord  and  your  Master. 
Vain  were  your  strength;  your  united  efforts  in  vain  were  exerted. 
But  should  it  please  me  to  draw  you  aloft,  with  ease  could  I  lift  you, 
Not  yourselves  alone,  but  the  earth  itself  and  the  ocean.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  VIII. 


Should  I  then  bind  the  chain  round  the  topmost  peak  of  Olympus, 
There  the  stupendous  frame  would  hang,  suspended  in  aether. 
Such  is  my  pow'r  compared  with  the  might  of  Gods  and  of  mortals." 

Such  his  command.     And  in  silent  awe  th'  assembly  received  it, 
Wond'ring  much  at  his  words :  for  stern  and  severe  was  their  menace. 
Answered  however,  at  length,  the  blue-eyed  goddess  Athene:    (30) 
"Sire  of  us  all!    Great  Kronos'  son!  supreme  among  sov'reigns! 
Well  we  know,  and  all  acknowledge,  that  none  can  resist  thee. 
Still  must  we  grieve,  and  pity  the  woes  of  the  Danaan  warriors, 
Helpless  left,  to  endure  thy  wrath  and  perish  before  us. 
Yet  we  obey  thy  mandate,  and  mix  no  more  in  the  contest. 
Counsel  howbeit  thou  wilt  not,  surely,  forbid  us  to  offer: 
So  that  they  sink  not  all  o'erwhelmed  by  the  weight  of  thine  anger." 

Smiling  upon  her,  Zeus  these  words  addressed  to  his  daughter  : 
"Be  of  good  cheer,  Tritonia,  child  belov'd!  nor  interpret 
Aught  that  I  said  too  harshly.     To  thee  am  I  ever  indulgent."       (40) 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  brazen-hoof  d  steeds  attached  to  his  chariot, 
Swift  as  the  wind.    Broad  floated  their  golden  manes  on  their  shoulders. 
Golden  raiment  around  him  he  flung;  then  mounted  the  chariot, 
Bearing  aloft  in  his  hand  a  golden  scourge;  and  the  horses 
Lashed;   and   with  right   good   will  they  darted  away  through   the 

aether, 
Spread  forth  betwixt  this  earth  and  the  star-strown  concave  of  heaven. 
Fountful  Ida,  the  teeming  nurse  of  each  beast  of  the  forest, 
Reached  he;  and  Gargarus'  height  with  its  sacred  grove  and  its  altar. 
There  did  the  father  of  Gods  and  men  draw  rein,  and  the  horses 
Loosed;  and  from  mortal  sight  in  a   shroud   of  vapour   concealed 
them:  (50) 

Thence,  on  the  topmost  peak  high-throned,  exulting  in  glory, 
Viewed  at  his  feet  the  tow'rs  of  Troy  and  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 

Now  had  the  Greeks  partaken  a  hasty  meal,  and  for  battle 
Each  beneath  his  tent  braced  on  his  glittering  armour. 
While,  on  their  part,  the  Trojans  throughout  the  city  were  arming ; 
Fewer  in  number  indeed,  yet  not  less  eager  for  conflict. 
Well  was  their  need  !  compelled  to  fight  for  their  wives  and  their 
children. 


Book  VIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  155 

Wide  were  the  gates  thrown  open,  and  forth  the  multitude  issued, 
Footmen  and  horse,  mid  the  clash  of  arms  and  the  rattle  of  chariots, 
Pouring  forth  on  the  plain.    When  now  both  hosts  were  confronted,  (60) 
Dire  was  the  clash  of  shields,  of  spears,  and  of  panoplied  warriors 
Grappling  with  might  and   main.     And  the  bosses  round   of  their 

bucklers 
Close  together  were  thrust.     Then  arose  the  din  of  the  battle. 
Shouts  of  victorious  joy,  and  cries  and  groans  of  the  vanquished 
Mixed  in  one  roar.     Then  streamed  with  blood  the  ground  that  they 

trampled. 
Thus,  while  the  sacred  light  waxed  strong,  and  the  sun  was  ascending, 
Wound  for  wound  was  exchanged,  and  hero  perished  for  hero. 
But  when  the  sun  had  attained  his  mid-day  height  in  the  concave, 
Then  hung  forth  the  Father  his  golden  scales.     In  the  balance 
Laid  he  the  long-reposing  fates  now  ripe  for  fulfilment  (70) 

Both  of  the  Trojans  and  Greeks :  fates  fraught  with  death  and  ivith 

conquest. 
Held  by  the  middle,  he  poised  them  on  high ;  and  the  scale  of  the 

Grecians, 
Heavy  with  death,  sank  low.     Earth's  fruitful  bosom  received  it. 
Bounded  aloft  the  Troian  scale  and  invaded  the  heavens. 

Zeus  then  thundered  aloud  from  Ida's  height,  and  the  lightning 
Blazing,  among  the  Greeks  flashed  fierce.     They  beheld,  and  amaze- 
ment 
Seized  on  their  souls,  and  each  bold  cheek  grew  pallid  with  terror. 
Then  nor  Idomeneus  dared  remain,  nor  great  Agamemnon, 
Nor  th'  Aiantes  twain,  those  valiant  servants  of  Ares. 
Nestor  alone,  of  Greece  th'  inspiring  spirit  and  guardian  (80) 

Staid.     No  choice  was  left  him :  for  one  of  his  steeds  was  disabled. 
Him  Alexandros,  Helena's  spouse,  had  pierced  with  an  arrow. 
Full  on  the  front,  where  the  forelock  hair  sprouts  forth  from  the 

forehead, 
Lighted  the  dart,  on  a  spot  where  a  wound  received  would  be  mortal. 
Smitten,  in  torment  he  reared,  for  the  brain  was  reached  by  the  arrow. 
Writhing  around  the  dart  he  plunged  and  entangled  his  fellows. 
Down  sprang  Nestor  in  haste,  with  his  sword  to  sever  the  traces, 


156  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Just  as  advancing  swift  through  the  press  came  the  chariot  of  Hector, 
Bearing  exulting  along  in  the  full  career  of  his  onset 
Hector  himself.     Then,  Nestor!  thy  days  of  life  had  been  ended,  (90) 
Had  not  brave  Diomedes  perceived  the  danger  that  threatened. 
Shouting  aloud  in  a  thundering  voice  he  appealed  to  Odysseus  : 
"Whither,  Laertes'  heav'n-born  son,  deep-scheming  Odysseus, 
Whither,    turning  thy  back,  dost   thou  run   with  the  crowd,  like  a 

dastard? 
Look  to  it!  lest  from  behind  transfix' d  some  spear  shall  arrest  thee. 
Turn  !  and  assist  our  aged  friend  and  repel  his  assailant." 
Thus  he  spake.     Much-enduring  Odysseus  heard  not  the  summons. 
On  he  pressed,   till  safely  he  reached  the  ships  of  the   Grecians. 
Then,  though  alone,  Tydeides  confronted  the  Trojans  advancing, 
Standing  before  the  steeds  of  Neleus'  sonr  to  protect  him,         (100) 
Thus  exhorting  his  friend  with  encouraging  words  of  assurance  : 
"Sorely,  my  good  old  friend,  do  these  youthful  warriors  oppress  thee, 
Strength  hast  thou  little  left,  and  age  weighs  heavy  upon  thee  : 
Weary  and  worn  is-  thy  faithful  attendant :  slow  are  thy  horses : 
Mount  my  car !  and  behold  how  these  Troian  coursers  will  bear  us 
Sweeping  across  the  plain,  now  here,  now  there  •  now  advancing 
Fierce  to  the  charge;  now  swift  in  pursuit;  now  haply  retreating. 
These  from  ^Eneas  I  took — they  are  used  to  war  and  its  terrors. 
These  thy  steeds  to  our  servants  be  giv'n  in  charge.    With  the  others 
Meet  we  the  foe.     Then  Hector  shall  feel,  that  insolejit  boaster,    (no) 
Whether  Tydeides'  spear  can  rage  in  the  hands  of  its  master." 

Thus  Diomedes  advised.     Gerenian  Nestor  assented. 
Sthenelus  lightly  then  sprang  down  from  the  car  of  his  master, 
Joining  Eurymedon  brave,  and  took  charge  of  the  horses  of  Nestor, 
While  on  Tydeides'  car  both  chiefs  prepared  for  the  combat. 
Nestor  assumed  the  shining  reins  and  lashed  on  the  horses, 
Urging  them  on,  till  Hector  i?i  full  career  they  encountered. 
Hurrying  impetuous  on,  Tydeides  darted  his  jav'lin, 
Aiming  at  Hector's  breast;  b&gt;ut  it  missed  its  mark,  and  Thebaean 
Heniopeus,  his  charioteer,  struck  full  on  the  bosom  (I2°) 

Under  the  pap :  and  he  dropped  the  reins,  and  fell  from  the  chariot. 
Back  recoiled  in  terror  the  steeds,  and  the  hapless  attendant 


Book  VIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  157 

Breathed  his  last  on  the  plain  where  he  lay,  and  his  spirit  forsook 

him. 
Grieved  was  Hector  at  heart,  at  the  death  of  his  friend  and  attendant : 
There,  however,  he  left  him  stretched,  for  vain  was  his  sorrow. 
Forthwith  another  driver  he  sought,  nor  long  did  his  horses 
Lack  an  experienced  hand  to  assume  their  reins  and  direct  them. 
Brave  Archeptolemus,  Iphitus'  son,  he  found,  who  the  chariot 
Mounted  at  once,  and  assumed  the  reins,  and  encouraged  the  horses. 

Then  had  been  wrought  unheard-of  feats  of  prowess  and  valour:  (130) 
Then  had  the  Trojans  been  pent  in  their  town,  like  sheep  for  the 

slaughter, 
Had  not  the  Father  of  Gods  and  men  perceived  and  forbid  it. 
Dreadfully  rolled  his  thunder.     Forth  flashed  the  bolt,  and  alighting 
Blazing,  down  on  the  ground  at  the  feet  of  Diomed's  horses, 
Wrapped  them  in  dire  sulphureous  flames  and  smouldering  vapour. 
Low  crouched  the  steeds  beneath  the  car,  all  trembling  with  terror. 
Then  from  the  hands  of  Nestor  flew  the  reins,  and  the  old  man 
Shuddered  with  fear,  and  addressed  these  words  to  brave  Diomedes  : 
"Turn,  son  of  Tydeus !   turn  thy  steeds,  and  retreat  from  the  contest ; 
Seest  thou  not  that  the  might  of  Zeus  is  fighting  against  thee?     (140) 
This  day's  glory  Kronion  hath  granted  our  foe;  but  to-morrow 
Victory  yet  may  be  ours,  if  so  perchance  it  shall  please  him. 
Nought  can  the  force  of  mortal  man  prevail,  nor  his  valour 
Jove's  high  will  to  control,  or  contend  in  strength  with  the  mightiest." 

Then  Diomedes,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle  responded: 
"All  thou  say'st,  old  man,  is,  like  fate's  decrees,  undisputed. 
Grief,  however,  consumes  my  heart  and  soul,  when  in  fancy 
Heclor  I  hear  exulting,  and  boasting  aloud  to  his  Trojans: 
'Lo !    where  Tydeides  flies  to  his  ships  from  the  terrors  0/"  Hector!' 
Thus   will   he  vaunt.     Yawn  wide    then,    Earth!    and  hide  my   con- 
fusion." (~*-$0) 
Then  to  his  words  in  turn  replied  Gerenian  Nestor: 
"Warlike  Tydeus'  son!     What   words  are  these  thou  hast  spoken? 
What  though  vaunting  Hector  should  call  thee  base  and  a  recreant, 
Small  assent  will  his  boasts  receive  from  Trojans  or  Dardans, 
Or  from  the  weeping  widows  of  those  brave  Troian  heroes, 


158  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Whom  in  the  flow'r  of  their  youth  thine  arm  hath  hurled  to  destruction." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  turned  the  stamping  steeds  and  the  chariot, 
Joining  the  flying  rout.     And  the  Trojans  followed,  and  Hector, 
Shouting  triumphant,  and  pouring  destructive  missiles  upon  them. 
Loud  above  all  resounded  the  shout  of  crest-waving  Hector:    (160) 
"Honour'd,  Tydeides !  once  was  thy  name  at  the  feasts  of  the  Grecians; 
High  did  they  seat  thee,  and  heaped  thy  board,  and  replenished  thy 

goblet; 
Now  will  they  hold  thee  in  scorn  when  they  see  thee  fly  like  a  woman. 
Off  with  thee!  paltry  girl!    The  walls  of  our  Ilian  city, 
Hector  retreating,   thou  ne'er  shalt   climb,  nor   our  wives  and   our 

daughters 
Carry  away  to  thy  ships.     At  my  hands  thy  doom  shall  await  thee." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  Tydeides  heard,    and  inly  debated 
Whether  to  turn  his  steeds  and  again  confront  his  pursuers. 
Thrice  in  the  depths  of  his  heart  this  thought  arose,  and  as  often 
Zeus  with  fresh-vollied  thunders  from  Ida's  summit  repressed  it,  (170) 
Beaconing  on  the  Trojans  to  seize  their  moment  for  vict'ry. 
Hector  then  shouted  aloud,  and  thus  encouraged  the  Trojans: 

"Hear  me!    ye  Trojans,  Lycians,  and  fierce  Dardanian  swordsmen, 
Shew  yourselves  men,  my  friends!    Remember  your  fame  and  your 

valour, 
Now  is  the  time — I  behold  it  nigh — when  Zeus  hath  accorded 
Conquest  and  glory  to  Troy;  to  the  Greeks  defeat  and  confusion. 
Fools  that  they  were !     Behold  what  walls  they  have  built  to  protect 

them, 
Worthless  and  weak!   unfit  to  arrest  my  impetuous  onset. 
See,   too,  the   trench   they  have  dug!     My   steeds   at  a  bound   will 

o'erleap  it. 
Then,  to  their  hollow  ships  through  their  headlong  rout  when  I  lead 

you,  (l8o) 

Some  one  be  mindful  of  fire.     Let  blazing  torches  be  kindled. 
So  shall  I  wrap  their  fleet  in  devouring  flames,  and  the  Argives, 
Stifled,  and  blind  with  smoke,  fall  an  easy  prey  to  your  valour." 
Thus  he  spake.    Then  his  horses  he  cheered,  and  thus  he  addressed 

them : 


Book  VIII.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


159 


"Xanthus,  and  ye,  brave  steeds,  Podargus,  Lampus,  and  yEthon! 
Now  is  your  time  to  requite  me  for  all  my  care,  and  the  kindness 
Shewn  you  by  fair  Andromache,  great  Eetion's  daughter; 
Her,  who  hath  fed  you  oft  with  rich  abundance  of  barley; 
Mingling  with  wine  your  drink,  when  your  faint 'ing  spirits  required  itj 
Caring  for  you  before  myself,  her  lord  and  her  husband;  (I9°) 

Now  be  ye  swift,  and  follow  them  up,  and  help  me  to  capture 
That  great  shield  of  Nestor,  whose  fame  ascends  to  the  heavens; 
All,  both  its  orb  and  its  handles,  of  solid  gold.     From  his  shoulders 
Give  me  to  tear  Diomedes'  arms,  that  marvellous  corslet 
Wrought  with  Daedalian  skill :  for  Hephaestus  himself  was  the  artist. 
These  should  we  take,  this  night  I  might  hope  to  behold  the  Achaians 
Hurrying  onboard  their  ships,  and  speedingtheir  fight  der  the  ocean." 

Boastingly  thus  he  spake.     But  Hera  indignantly  heard  him, 
Quiv'ring  with  rage  on  her  throne,  while  Olympus  trembled  beneath 

her. 
Then  to  Poseidon,  mighty  Pow'r,  she  turned,  and  addressed  him:  (200) 
"Shame  on  such  deeds!     Thou  wide  earth-shaker,  hast  thou  no  pity? 
Is  not  thy  soul  within  thee  grieved  for  our  perishing  Grecians? 
Many  and  rich  are  the  gifts  which  at  Helice  fair  and  at  yEgae 
Duteous,  they  heap  on  thy  shrine.     Oh!  help  them.     Will  them  to 

conquer ! 
Should    we   but  join — we   pow'rs   who   befriend   the   cause   of  the 

Grecians — 
Troy  might  be  turned  to  flight :  those  thunders  stripped  of  their  terrors : 
Zeus  in  his  turn  might  grieve,  left  sitting  alone  upon  Ida." 

Angered,   and   much   disturbed,  thus   answered  the   Lord   of  the 

earthquake : 
"Oh!  inconsiderate  Hera!   What  words  are  these  thou  hast  uttered? 
Think  not  I  shall  persuade  the  Gods  to  contend  with  Kronion. 
///  would  it  fare  with  all  ^/"opposed  in  fight  to  the  mightiest."       (211) 
Thus  they  communed  on  high,  disclosing  their  thoughts  to  each 

other. 
All  the  space  meanwhile,  from  the  ships  to  the  wall  and  the  trenches, 
Densely  was  filled  with  bucklered  men,  with  horses  and  chariots, 
Crowded  togeth'r  in  a  close-wedg'd  mass,  and  followed  by  Hector, 


160  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Brave  as  the  God  of  war,  and  by  Zeus  led  onward  to  glory. 
Then  bad  devouring  flames  consumed  the  fleets  of  Achaia, 
Had  not  Atreides  himself,  all  breathless  with  haste  and  exertion, 
Prompted  by  Hera  divine,  stood  forth  and  rallied  his  warriors. 
Swiftly  his  course  he  bent  to  the  tents  and  ships  of  the  Grecians,  (220) 
Holding  aloft  in  his  hand  his  purple  robe,  as  a  signal: 
There  arrived,  on  the  tall  black  ship  of  Odysseus  he  mounted, 
Moored  in  the  midst  of  the  line,    that  on  either  hand  they  might 

hear  him, 
There,  to  the  ships  and  tents  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias, 
Here,  to  Achilles'  camp:  for  these  their  vessels  had  stationed 
Farthest,  at  either  extreme,  on  their  strength  and  valour  relying. 
Thence,  in  accents  clear  and  loud,  he  exhorted  the  Grecians: 

"Shame  on  ye  Greeks!     Ye  disgrace  the  name!     But  in  form  are 
ye  soldiers. 
Where  are  your  boasts,  when  ye  vaunted  yourselves  the  bravest  of 

mortals  ? 
All  that  empty  and  braggart  talk  ye  poured  forth  at  Lemnos,  (230) 
Gorging  yourselves  with  the  flesh  of  horned  steers  at  our  banquet, 
Crowning  the  flowing  bowl,   each  cup  false  courage  inspiring. 
Then  was  each  man  a  match  for  a  hundred  or  two  of  the  Trojans, 
Meeting  them  fairly  in  fight!     But  now  one  singly  suffices, 
Hector!  to  drive  you  before  him,  and  burn  the  ships  ye  rely  on. 
Father  Zeus !  didst  thou  e'er  in  thy  wrath  thus  hunt  to  destruction 
One  of  the  mighty,  the  kings  of  the  earth,  and  extinguish  his  glory? 
Yet  did  I  ne'er  unhonoured  thy  altars  pass,  when  from  Argos 
Hither  on  luckless  errand  I  sailed  writh  my  many-benched  vessels. 
Each  fair  altar  smoked  wTith  the  fat  and  the  thighs  of  my  victims  (240) 
Offered,  with  prayer  that  Troy's  proud  walls  thou  wouldst  crumble 

in  ruin. 
Now  to  my  prayers,  Oh!  grant  this  last  despah'ing  petition, 
All  I  ask  is  flight  and  escape.     Oh!  suffer  not  Troia 
Thus  to  sweep  from  the  earth  these  last  remains  of  the  Grecians." 

Thus  he  prayed.     Zeus,  pitying  his  tears,  the  petition  accorded; 
Opened  a  way  for  safety,  nor  suffered  the  people  to  perish. 
Forthwith  an  eagle,  noblest  of  birds,  he  sent,  as  an  omen, 


Book  VIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  161 

Holding  a  swift  hind's  tender  fawn  fast  clutched  in  his  talons. 
Soaring  o'er  Jove's  Panomphaean  shrine,  where  gathered  the  Grecians 
Instant  in  prayer,  down  cast  he  the  fawn  at  the  feet  of  the  altar.  (250) 
This  when   they  saw,  and  perceived   that  the  bird  from  Zeus    had 

been  sent  them, 
Courage  they  took,  and  renewed  the  fight,  and  rushed  on  the  Trojans. 
Then  no  Greek  of  that  countless  host  might  boast  to  have  equalled 
Tydeus'  son,  as  in  swift  career  he  urged  on  his  horses, 
Crossing  the  trench  to  resume  his  post  in  front  of  the  battle. 
Far  before  all  he  encountered  a  crested  chief  of  the  Trojans, 
Phradmon's  son,  Agelaiis,  who  turned  to  flight  when  he  saw  him  : 
But,  as  he  turned,  Tydeides'  spear  through  his  back  found  a  passage, 
Ent'ring  between  his  shoulders  and  issuing  forth  from  his  bosom; 
Down  he  fell  from  his  car,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him.     (260) 
Then  came  th'  Atreidae  twain,  Agamemnon  and  brave  Menelaus; 
Close  upon  these  th'  Aiantes  twain,  all  glowing  with  ardour; 
Next  Idomeneus  bold,  and  his  trusty  friend  and  companion 
Merion,  wondrous  chief!  like  death-dealing  Ares  in  battle. 
These  Eurypylus  followed,  the  noble  son  of  Evaemon; 
Teucer  the  ninth,  with  bended  bow,  and  the  shaft  on  his  bowstring. 
Shelter' d  behind  the  shield  of  great  Telamonian  Aias 
Teucer  stood.     The  shield  withdrawn,  he  chose  out  his  victim, 
Taking  unerring  aim.      Then  woe  to  the  man  it  encountered! 
Wing'd  with   death   was  the  shaft :    he   fell,   and  his  spirit  forsook 
him.  (270) 

Back  retreating  again,  like  a  child  to  his  mother,  in  safety 
Under  his  bright  protecting  shield  his  brother  received  him. 
Whom  did  he  first,  whom  last,  pick  off  from  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans? 
First  Orsilochus,  Ormenus  then,  and  next  Ophelestes, 
Daetor,  and  Chromius  met  their  fate,  and  divine  Lycophontes, 
Then  Polyaemon's  son  Amopaon,  and  brave  Menalippus. 
One  after  other  they  fell,  and  strewed  the  ground  with  their  corses. 
Him,  rejoicing,  beheld  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
Thinning  with  deadly  bow  the  advancing  ranks  of  the  Trojans. 
Quickly  beside  him  he  stood,  and  thus  addressed  he  the  archer     (280) 
"Leader  of  heroes!     Dear  to  my  soul!     Telamonian  Teucer 


:62  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII 


Hold  not  thy  hand!     Shoot  ever  thus.     Be  a  light  to  the  Grecians, 
Aye,  and  to  Telamon  too,  thy  father;  who  when  an  infant, 
Spite  of  thy  bastard  birth,  in  his  palace  nurtured  and  reared  thee, 
Now  to  receive,  from  thy  deeds,  though  distant,  glory  and  worship. 
Hear  what  I  say,  and  what,  be  assured,  shall  be  fully  accomplished, 
When  the  great  ^Egis-bearing  Zeus  and  Athena  shall  grant  me, 
After  so  many  toils,  fair  Troia's  city  to  capture, 
Next  to  my  own  in  value  some  costly  prize  will  I  give  thee: 
Either  a  tripod  of  gold,  or  two  good  steeds,  with  their  chariot,   (290) 
Or,  if  it  please  thee  better,  some  captive  maid  be  thy  portion." 

Thus    to    his   words    replied  young  Teucer,    the    brave  and    the 
blameless  : 
"Glorious  Atreides!     Need  hast  thou  none  to  exhort  me  to  action. 
Think  not  I  mean  to  desist,  while  strength  and  vigour  are  left  me. 
From  the  first  moment  we  turned  the  Trojans  in  flight  to  their  city, 
Have  I  not  ceased  to  slay,  and  to  strike  down  men  with  my  arrows. 
Eight  of  my  long-barb'd  shafts  have  already  flown  from  my  bowstring, 
Each  stands  fix't  in  the  heart  of  some  young  vigorous  warrior; 
Yet  can  I  never  reach  this  raging  dog  with  my  weapons." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  another  shaft  let  fly  from  his  bowstring      (300) 
Aiming  at  Hector  full;  for  his  soul  was  eager  to  slay  him. 
Hector  however  it  missed ;  Gorgythion  the  brave  and  the  blameless, 
One  of  the  sons  of  Priam,  received  the  dart  in  his  bosom. 
Castianeira,  divine  in  feature  and  form,  was  his  mother, 
Who  in  vEsyme  had  dwelt,  there  wooed  and  wedded  by  Priam. 
And  as  with  fruit  and  vernal  show'rs   surcharged,  in  a  garden 
Some  bright  poppy  declines  its  head,  and  droops  with  its  burthen, 
Sidelong  thus  was  his  fair  young  head  weighed  down  by  his  helmet. 

Teucer  again  another  shaft  dismissed  from  his  bowstring, 
Aiming  once  more  at  Hector,  with  fixed  resolve  to  destroy  him.  (310) 
Hector  again  he  missed — for  Apollo  wafted  it  sideways. 
Brave  Archeptolemus,  Hector's  charioteer,  to  the  onset 
Urging  his  fiery  steeds,   it  struck  'neath  the  pap,   on  his  bosom. 
Down  from  the  car  he  dropped.     Then  swerved  in  terror  the  horses, 
Checked  in  their  mid  career,  and  his  strength  and  spirit  forsook  him. 
Grieved  was  Hector  at  heart  for  the  loss  of  his  faithful  attendant. 


Book  VIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  163 

There,  however,  he  left  him  stretched,  for  vain  was  his  sorrow. 
Cebriones,  his  brother,  was  near:    him  Hector  invited 
Forthwith  to  take  the  reins,  and  at  once  he  sprang  to  the  chariot. 
Then  leaped  Hector  down  from  the  shining  car,  and  like  thunder  (320) 
Shouted  a  dreadful  shout;   and  lifting  a  ponderous  fragment 
Rushed  on  Teucer  at  once,  with  determined  purpose  to  crush  him. 
He,  meanwhile,  with  another  shaft  from  the  store  in  his  quiver 
Fixed  on  the  string,  stood  in  act  to  shoot.     But  crest-waving  Hector, 
Just  when  the  bow  was  drawn,   ere  the  shaft  leaped  forth,  on  his 

shoulder 
Dashed  the  rough  stone.     On  the  collar-bone,  where  the  neck  from 

the  bosom 
Springs   (a  most  dang'rous  place  for  a  wound),   it   struck,  and  the 

bowstring 
Broke,  and  benumbed  his  hand  and  wrist  drawn  home  to  the  shoulder. 
Down  he  sank  on  his  knees,  and  the  bow  on  the  ground  dropp'd 

harmless. 
Aias,  however,  his  fall'n  and  wounded  brother  forsook  not,       (330) 
Sprang  to  his  aid,  and  o'er  him  stood,  and  extended  his  buckler, 
While  from  the  ground  two  comrades  true  upraised  and  sustained  him, 
Brave  Mecisteus,  Echius'  son,  and  godlike  Alastor. 
These  to  the  Grecian  ships  conveyed  him,  heavily  groaning. 

Then  once  more  did  Olympian  Zeus  give  strength  to  the  Trojans. 
Back  to  within  their  trench  they  drove  the  Greeks  in  confusion, 
Hector  leading  their  van  with  fierce  and  infuriate  aspect. 
As  when  a  hound  pursues  some  lion  or  boar  of  the  forest, 
Following   him   up    from   behind   he    hangs   on  his   thighs  and  his 

haunches, 
Watches,  and  galls  him  at  every  turn,  on  his  swiftness  relying;  (340) 
Hector  thus  hung  on  the  rear  of  the  long-hair'd  Greeks,  and  the 

hindmost 
Still,  as  they  fled,  struck  down,  and  marked  his  path  with  their  corses. 
Now  had  they  passed  the  fosse  and  its  deep-fix  t  stakes,  in  disorder 
Hurrying  along,  and  many  had  fall'n  by  the  hands  of  the  Trojans. 
Densely  crowded,  among  their  ships  the  rest  were  entangled, 
Shouting  one  to  another,  uplifting  their  hands  to  the  heavens, 


i64  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Calling  on  all  the  gods,  and  praying  aloud  for  deliv'rance. 

Hector  around  the  press  with  his  long-maned  steeds  was  careering, 

Darting  from  eyes  like  Ares'  own,  Gorgonian  splendour. 

This,  when  the  white-armed  Hera  beheld,  she  pitied  the  Grecians;  (350) 

Thus  in  indignant  words  expressing  her  grief  to  Athene: 

''Daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Zeus,  say,  must  we  abandon 

Care  for  the  perishing  Greeks  in  this  last  extreme  of  their  fortune? 

Lo!  how  they  sink  o'erwhelmed  by  an  evil  fate!     How  they  suffer 

Under  the  insolent  force  of  one,  unendurably  raging, 

Hector,  Priamus'  son!     What  woes  he  already  hath  wrought  them." 

Thus  in  her  turn  replied  the  blue-eyed  Goddess  Athene: 
"Vain  were  his  valour  and  strength,  and  long,  long  since  had  he  perished 
Under  the  Grecian  sword,  beneath  the  ramparts  of  Ilion, 
Were  not  the  mind  of  Zeus  my  sire  insanely  perverted;  (360) 

Cruel,  unjust  as  he  is,  still  bent  on  thwarting  my  efforts. 
Has  he  forgotten,  ungrateful  I   how  oft  I  came  to  the  rescue, 
Saving  his  son,  opprest  with  the  tasks  imposed  by  Eurystheus? 
Oft  unto  heav'n  in  distress  he  cried.     Then  Zeus  would  dispatch  me 
Down  from  Olympus  to  lend  him  aid,  and  save  him  from  mischief 
Had  my  prophetic  soul  but  whispered  he  thus  would  requite  me 
When  to  the  dismal  realm  of  Hell's  black  gaoler  he  sent  me, 
Hades'  dog  commissioned  to  chain,  and  from  Erebus  drag  him, 
Ne'er  had  that  son  recrossed  those  darksome  Stygian  waters. 
Now  doth  my  sire  abhor  me,  and  yields  himself  wholly  to  Thetis,  (370) 
Only  because  she  embraced  his  knees  and  kissed  them,  and  suppliant 
Raised  with  her  hand  his  beard,  and  besought  him  to  honour  Achilles. 
Soon,  no  doubt,  will  he  call  me  again  his  azure-eyed  fav'rite. 
Hera!    do  thou  however  the  horses  yoke  to  our  chariot. 
I  myself  to  the  palace  of  Zeus  will  repair,  and  for  combat 
There  will  I  don  my  refulgent  arms.     Let  us  see  whether  Hector, 
Priamus'  high-plumed  son,  will  hail  with  joy  our  appearance 
Rallying  the  Greeks,  and  restoring  the  broken  lines  of  their  battle. 
Then  some   few   of  the  Trojans  perchance  may  the  dogs  and  the 

vultures 
Feast  with  their  fat  and  their  flesh  on  the  shore  by  the  ships  of  the 

Grecians."  (3  80) 


Book  VIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  165 

Thus  she  spake,  and  the  white-armed  Here  gladly  assented, 
And  without  further  delay  th'  imperial  daughter  of  Kronos 
Braced  on  th'  immortal  coursers   their   frontlets   of  gold   and   their 

harness. 
Pallas  Athene,  daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Kronion, 
Then  let  fall  on  the  floor  of  her  father's  palace  the  mantle, 
Gloriously   wrought,    which   the    skill    of    her   own   fair   hands   had 

embroidered. 
Then  in  the  arms  of  cloud-compelling  Zeus  she  arrayed  her,. 
Donning  his  corslet  for  dreary  war,  and  the  horrors  of  battle. 
Armed,  on  the  fiery  car  she  sprang:  firm  grasping  the  jav'lin 
Stubborn  and  huge,  with  whose  pond'rous  force,  uplifted  in  anger,  (390) 
Child  of  a  mighty  sire,  she  quells  the  array  of  her  foemen. 
Forthwith  Hera  the  scourge  applied  and  excited  the  coursers. 
Clanging,,  self-opened,  the  gates  of  Heav'n  flew  wide,  by  the  Horae 
Guarded,  to  whom  are  entrusted  the  portals  e?/"  Heav'n  and  Olympus, 
Or  to  roll  back  their  veil  of  cloud,  or  to  wrap  them  in  darkness. 
Urged   to    their   speed,    through    these    swift     dashed   the    celestial 

coursers. 
Dire  was  the  wrath  of  Zeus  when  from  Ida's  height  he  beheld  them. 
Iris  the  golden-winged  he  dispatched ;  and  these  were  his  orders : 
"Iris!  away!  be  swift!    Turn  back  that  pair,  nor  permit  them, 
Thus  my  commands    to    oppose.     A   fight  were  unseemly  between 

us.  (400) 

Tell  them — this  I  declare,  this  threat  shall  be  surely  accomplished, 
Down  from  their  car  will  I  hurl  them,  their  horses  lamed  and  disabled, 
Rolling  beneath  their  car  overturned  and  shattered  to  fragments. 
Ten  revolving  years  shall  not  suffice  to  restore  them 
Whole  from  the  burning  wounds  my  bolts  on  themselves  shall  have 

branded; 
So  shall  Athene  learn  what  it  is  to  contend  with  her  father  : 
Hera's  conduct  I  less  resent,  and  reluctantly  punish ; 
Her  I  expect  my  designs  to  thwart,  for  such  is  her  custom."" 

Iris  heard,  and  swift  as  the  storm  set  forth  on  her  errand. 
Down  from  the  height  of  Ida  she  held  her  course  to  Olympus,     (410) 
Cleft  with  many  a  deep  ravine.     From  the  gates  of  Olympus 


1 66  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Issuing,    she   met   them,    arrested   their   course,    and   delivered   her 

message  : 
"Whither  so  fasti     What  madness  is  this  that  hath  seized  on  your 

spirits  ? 
Zeus  permits  you  not  to  afford  your  aid  to  the  Grecians. 
Hear  what  he  threatens ; — what,  be  assured,  he  will  fully  accomplish. 
Down  from  your  car  will  he  hurl  you,  your  horses  lamed  and  disabled, 
Rolling  beneath  your  chariot  overturned  and  shattered  to  fragments. 
Ten  completed  years  shall  not  suffice  to  restore  you 
Whole,  from  the  burning  wounds  his  bolts  on  yourselves  shall  have 

branded : 
So  shall  Athena  learn  what  it  is  to  contend  with  her  father.  (420) 

Hera's  conduct  he  less  resents — will  reluctantly  punish. 
Her  he  expects  to  thwart  his  plans;  for  such  is  her  custom. 
As  for  thee  however,  audacious  and  insolent  creature ! 
Dare  but  to  raise  one  instant  that  spear  of  thine  to  oppose  him — !" 

Iris  thus.     Her  message  delivered,  she  turned  and  departed. 
Hera  then  spake,  and  thus  addressed  she  Pallas  Athene: 
"Daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Zeus!     Now,  alas!  I  acknowledge, 
Bootless  it  is  to  contest  with  him  the  guidance  of  mortals. 
Let  them  then  perish  or  live,  as  chance  may  direct,  or  his  pleasure, 
Trojans  and   Greeks;   let   him  please   himself  and   dispose,  to   his 

liking,  (430) 

Henceforth  all  their  fortunes  and  fates:  'tis  his  due,  and  he  claims  it." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  back  to  the  palace  the  car  and  the  coursers 
Turned.    When  arrived,  the  Horas  came,  a7id  the  horses  unharnessed, 
Led  them  away,  and  bound  them  fast  to  ambrosial  mangers. 
Leaving  the  car  inclined  on  the  polished  wall  of  the  palace. 
They  meanwhile  on  couches  of  gold  reclined,  in  th'  assembly 
Mixed,  once  more,  of  the  gods,  subdued  and  saddened  in  spirit. 

Zeus  meanwhile  from  Ida  his  bright-wheeled  car  and  his  horses 
Drove  to  th'  Olympian  height,  fair  seat  of  the  blessed  immortals. 
Mighty  Poseidon,  earth-shaking  pow'r,  unharnessed  the  coursers,  (440) 
Laid  on  tressels  the  car,  and  a  mantlet  spread  to  protect  it. 
Thundering  Zeus  advanced,  and  resumed  his  seat  in  th'  assembly, 
High  on  his  throne  of  gold,  and  Olympus  trembled  beneath  him.

All  was  hushed  attention  and  awe,  while  Athena  and  Here 
Sate  by  themselves  remote,  nor  ventured  in  words  to  address  him. 
Zeus  however,  perceiving  their  thoughts,  interrupted  the  silence  : 
"Why  are  ye  thus  cast  down  and  sad,  Athena  and  Here? 
Sooth  to  say,  not  long  have  ye  toiled,  in  glorious  warfare, 
Troia's  sons  ye  so  bitterly  hate  to  subdue  and  extirpate. 
Such  are  my  might  and  strength,  not  all  the  Gods  in  Olympus,     (450) 
Striving  with  force  combined  could  drive  me  back,  from  my  purpose: 
Well  then  might  trembling  seize  on  your  limbs,  though  resplendent  in 

armour, 
Ere  ye  but  saw  the  fight,  or  dared  to  mix  in  the  combat. 
Had  ye  gone  farther,  all  my  threats  had  been  fully  accomplished. 
Down    from    your   chariot   thunder-smitten,    and    scorched    by   my 

lightnings, 
Never  again  had  ye  seen  the  blest  abodes  of  Olympus." 

Thus  he  spake.     But  Athena  and  Here'  murmuring  heard  him, 
Side  by  side  as  they  sate,  dire  woes  for  the  Trojans  devising. 
Silent  Athene'  sate,  nor  uttered  her  thoughts,  but  her  bosom 
Swelled  with  bitter  despite,  and  rage  at  the  words  of  her  father.   (460) 
Not  so  Hera,  whose  wrath  broke  forth  in  angry  reproaches: 
"Dread  and  severe  Kronion!  what  word  is  this  thou  hast  uttered? 
Well  we  know,  and  all  acknowledge  that  none  can  resist  thee, 
Yet  must  we  grieve  and  pity  the  woes  of  the  Danaan  warriors, 
Helpless  left  to  endure  thy  wrath,  and  perish  before  us; 
Yet  we  obey  thy  mandate  and  mix  no  more  in  the  contest. 
Counsel,  howbeit,  thou  wilt  not,  surely,  forbid  us  to  offer, 
So  that  they  sink  not  all  o'erwhelmed  by  the  weight  of  thy  vengeance." 

Thus  she  spake.     Then  Zeus  the  cloud-compeller  responded: 
"  Queen  of  the  full-orbed  eyes  august !  To-morrow  shall  shew  thee,  (470) 
Shouldst  thou  please  to  behold  it,  a  wider  sweep  of  destruction 
Dealt  by  the  might  of  thy  sov'reign  Lord  on  the  hosts  of  Achaia. 
Nor  shall  fierce  Hector  hold  his  destroying  hand  from  their  slaughter, 
Till  at  his  ships  he  arouse  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles: 
Ev'n  in  that  dreadful  day  when  close  at  the  sterns  of  their  vessels, 
Struggling  around  Patroclus  slain,  in  heaps  they  shall  perish, 
(So  have  the  fates  decreed).     But  of  thee  and  thy  anger  I  reck  not. 


1 68  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Go,  if  thou  wilt,  to  the  utmost  bounds  of  earth  and  of  ocean; 
Seek  those  realms  where  Iapetus  pines  in  gloom,  and  where  Kronos 
Sits  uncheered  by  the  circling  sun  or  the  breezes  of  heaven,  (480) 

Plunged  in  Tartarean  darkness,  above,  beneath,  and  around  them. 
Thither  betake  thyself  in  thy  wrathful  mood,   if  it  please  thee, 
Nor  shall  I  mourn  thy  loss:  for  in  insolence  none  can  surpass  thee." 

Thus  he  spake:  nor  did  white-armed  Here  venture  an  answer. 
Now  had  the   sun   his  blazing  torch  in  the  ocean  extinguished, 
Drawn  was  the  darksome  veil  of  night  o'er  field  and  o'er  furrow. 
Troy  with  regret  beheld  its  advance;  but  the  Greeks  with  rejoicing 
Welcomed,  thrice  welcomed,  its  longed-for  gloom,  and  the  respite  it 

brought  them. 
Hector  then  collected  around  him  the  chiefs  of  the  Trojans, 
Leading  them  off  from  the  ships  apart,  by  the  eddying  river,         (490) 
Where  undefiled  the  ground  shewed  clear,  uncumbered  with  corses. 
Down  from  their  cars  they  sprang  to  the  earth,  and  listened  attentive, 
While  the  belov'd  of  Zeus  addressed  them,  holding  his  jav'lin, 
Cubits  eleven  in  length.     Bright  gleamed  the  point  of  the  weapon; 
Bronze  was  the  blade;    and  with  golden  rings  to  the   shaft  it  was 

fastened. 
Leaning  on  this  he  spake ;  and  thus  delivered  his  order  : 

"Hear  me!  ye  Trojans,  Dardans,  and  brave  confederate  leaders, 
Strong  was  my  hope  ev'n  now  to  have  burned  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Slain  themselves,  and  return  to  our  wind-swept  Ilion  city. 
Night   however   has  stopped   my  career.     Nought  else   could   have 

rescued  (500) 

Them,  and  the  fleet  now  close  at  your  hands  on  the  shore  of  the  ocean. 
Yet,  while  obeying  the  night,  let  us  use  its  hours  to  advantage. 
Food  let  us  now  prepare,  and  our  wearied  steeds  from  their  harness 
Loosen,  and  rub  them  down,  and  throw  them  abundance  of  fodder. 
Send  to  the  city  for  all  supplies.     Let  sheep  and  let  oxen 
Speedily  thence  be  brought.    Sweet  wine  and  the  fruits  of  the  harvest 
Each  from  his  home  procure ;  and  let  plenty  of  wood  be  collected, 
So  through  the  live-long  night,  till  the  glad  return  of  the  morning, 
Many  a  fire  shall  blaze,  and  brighten  the  sky  with  its  splendour; 
Lest  under  cover  of  night  these  long-haired  sons  of  Achaia  (5IQ) 


Book  VIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Steal  away,  and  escape  o'er  the  broad-ridged  waves  of  the  ocean. 
Safe  and  unharmed  however  not  one  shall  embark,  but  shall  carry- 
Home,  and  at  leisure  digest,  some  lasting  mark  of  our  vengeance, 
Either  a  spear's  rude  thrust,  or  the  rankling  bite  of  an  arrow 
Ta'en  as  he  mounts  his  ship :  so  that  all  may  dread  for  the  future 
Troia's  shores  to  invade  and  involve  us  in  war  and  its  horrors. 
Let  two  heralds,  belov'd  of  Zeus,  proclaim  through  the  city 
Orders  that  all  our  beardless  youth  and  the  hoar  and  decrepit 
Watch  this  night  on  the  lofty  and  God-built  tow'rs  that  surround  it. 
Let  the  women  at  home  remain,  in  the  courts  of  their  houses,      (520) 
Each  maintaining  a  fire.     Let  a  guard  patrol  round  the  rampart, 
Lest  an  attempt  be  made  to  surprise  the  town,  undefended. 
Thus  be  it  done,  ye  chiefs  of  Troy!     And  let  all  be  effected 
Strictly  according  to  these  my  words:  for  our  safety  demands  it. 
This  for  to-night.     What  more  may  need  shall  be  told  in  the  morning. 
Trust  we  in  Zeus  and  in  all  the  Gods  that  to-morrow  shall  see  us 
Sweep  from  our  shores  these  fate-borne  dogs,  this  scourge  of  our  nation, 
Whom  in  their  sable  ships  ill  fate  hath  borne  to  our  country. 
During  the  night  let  a  careful  watch  through  our  lines  be  established ; 
And  the  first  glimpse  of  dawn  must  find  all  armed  for  the  combat,  (530) 
Ready  to  carry  the  war  to  the  hollow  ships-  of  the  Grecians. 
Then  shall  we  see  whether  Tydeus'  son,  renown'd  Diomedes, 
Back  to  our  walls  shall  drive  me,  or  pierced,  himself  by  my  jav'lin 
Fall,  and  his  bloody  spoils  become  the  prey  of  the  victor. 
Brave  indeed  must  he  be,  and  proof  will  he  give  of  his  valour, 
If  he  withstand  that  spear  in  to-morrow's  fight;  with  the  foremost 
Destined  to  perish;  with  many  a  comrade  slaughtered  around  him. 
This  shall  the  rising  sun  behold.     Oh!  would  that  a  prospect 
Bright  of  immortal  life  and  endless  youth,  and  of  honours, 
Such  as  men  pay  to  Pallas  or  Phoebus  self,  were  avouched  me,     (540) 
Half  so  sure  as  my  trust  that  to-morrow  shall  witness  our  triumph." 

Thus  did  Hector  harangue,  and  the  Trojans  shouted  approval. 
Then    did   the   horsemen   unyoke    their  sweating   steeds   from  their 

chariots, 
Keeping  them  each  however  attached  to  his  car  by  a  halter. 
Quickly  they  brought  from  the  city  supplies  of  sheep  and  of  oxen  ; 


170  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  VIII. 

Honey-sweet  wine  and  strengthening  bread  from  the  stores  in  their 

houses 
All  procured;  and  abundant  wood  for  fires  they  collected. 
Then  to  the  gods  above  were  perfect  hecatombs  offered. 
[Sweet  was  the  savour  that  rose,  by  the  breezes  wafted  to  heaven, 
Wafted  aloft  in  vain;  for  it  reached  not  the  blessed  immortals ;     (550) 
Won  from  them  no  good  will ;  for  Ilion's  city  they  hated  ; 
Priam  and  all  his  people  alike  they  held  in  abhorrence.] 

All  night  long  with  elated  hearts  in  the  lines  of  their  battle 
Rested  the  Trojans,  and  many  a  fire  blazed  brightly  among  them. 
As  when  around  the  glowing  moon  resplendent  in  aether 
Shines  forth  the  heav'nly  host,  and  the  air  reposes  in  stillness, 
Gleams  ev'ry  pointed  rock ;  stands  forth  each  buttress  in  prospect ; 
Shimmers  each  woodland  vale;  and  from  realms  of  unspeakable  glory 
Op'ning,  the  stars  are  revealed;  and  the  heart  of  the  shepherd  rejoices: 
Such,  and  so  many  the  fires,  by  the  Trojans  kindled,  illumined    (560) 
Eddying  Xanthus'  stream,  and  the  ships,  and  the  walls  of  the  city. 
Each  of  a  thousand  blazing  piles  saw  seated  around  it 
Fifty  warriors  of  Troy,  enjoying  its  warmth  and  its  splendour: 
While  beside  them  their  steeds,  on  white  spelt  feeding,  and  barley, 
Each  to  his  chariot  shackled,  awaited  the  coming  of  morning.

Argument. 


Agamemnon,  overwhelmed  with  grief  at  the  defeat  of  the  Greeks,  calls 
a  general  assembly j  at  which,  however,  Nestor  advises  a  more  private 
council  of  the  leaders,  a  strong  guard  being  first  placed  outside  the  wall. 
They  meet  accordingly  in  Agamemnon 's  tent;  when,  after  a  banquet,  it  is 
agreed  to  send  a  deputation  to  Achilles  with  handsome  offers  on  the  part 
of  Agamemnon  (including  the  restoration  of  Briseis)  to  induce  him  to  a 
reconciliation.  Odysseus,  Phoenix,  and  Aias  accordingly  p?'oceed  on  this 
mission.  Their  interview  with  Achilles  is  related.  It  proves  fruitless. 
Odysseus  a?id  Aias  retumi?ig  report  its  failure.  Diomede  counsels  the 
renewal  of  the  battle  with  the  earliest  break  of  day. 


ILIAD.     BOOK   IX. 


PHUS  through  the  night  did  the  Trojans  watch.     Meanwhile  the 
Achaians 
Panic  had  seized.     Chill  Terror,  companion  of  Flight,  had  possess'd 

them  ; 
While  unendurable  grief  o'erpow'r'd  the  souls  of  their  leaders. 
As  when  contending  winds  from  the  Thracian  shore  on  the  ocean, 
Boreas  and  Zephyr,  together  rush:  black  swells,  at  their  impulse, 
Sudden  and  fierce,  the  surging  wave,  and  a  tangle  of  seaweed, 
Torn  from  its  fishy  depths,  floats. waste  and  wide  on  the  billows: 
Thus  by  perplexing  thoughts  was  each  Grecian  bosom  distracted. 
Pierced  to  his  inmost  heart  with  grief  and  shame,  Agamemnon 
Now  commanded  the  clear-voiced  heralds  to  summon  the  people,  (10) 
(Yet  without  shouting  or  noise)  to  meet  in  a  gen'ral  assembly, 
Calling  on  each  by  name :  and  himself  took  the  lead  in  their  labours. 
Downcast  and  sad  th'  assembly  met.     Then  arose  Agamemnon. 
Tears  from  his   eyes   flowed   fast,  like  some  black  fountain,  whose 

waters 
Trickle  in  shadow  and  gloom  down  a  dark-browed  cliff  in  the  desert. 
Heaving  a  long-drawn  sigh  then  thus  he  addressed  the  assembly  : 
"Friends,   and  leaders  of  Greece!  ye  princes  and   chiefs    of  the 

people ! 
Zeus  hath  entangled  me  sore  in  the  toils  of  his  hearty  displeasure. 
Cruel !  for  did  he  not  promise,  and  nod  from  his  throne  to  confirm  it, 
Ilion's  tow'rs  to  uproot,  and  restore  me  in  triumph  to  Argos?         (20) 


174  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

'Twas  but  a  planned  and  bitter  deceit :  for  now  he  commands  me 
Home  to  return  inglorious,  and  mourn  o'er  the  loss  of  my  comrades. 
Such  is  his  sov'reign  will  irresistible;  who,  when  it  pleased  him, 
Manya  proud  city's  lofty  defences  hath  humbled  already, 
Manya  one  yet  will  humble,  for  uncontrolled  is  his  power. 
Now  let  us  acl  at  once.     Attend  my  words,  and  obey  me. 
Hence  let  us  fry  in  our  ships  to  the  dear-loved  land  of  our  fathers ; 
Never  shall  Troy's  wide  streets  by  our  conquering  forces  be  entered." 

Thus  spoke  the  king.     No  word  was  heard  in  reply :  but  in  silence 
Long   they   sate,    nor  cared  to  respond,  for  their  hearts   were  em- 
bittered. (30) 
Silence  at  length  Diomedes  broke,  and  addressed  Agamemnon: 

"Such  wild  counsel,  Atreides,  befits  not  thee,  as  our  sovereign. 
Here  am  I  free  to  oppose  it;  nor  let  such  freedom  offend  thee. 
Late,  before  all  the  Greeks,  didst  thou  disparage  my  valour, 
Calling  me  feeble,  unwarlike.     The  taunt  was  publicly  spoken. 
Every  man,  both  old  and  young,  can  remember  the  insult. 
Hear  me  now.     Unto  thee  the  son  of  mysterious  Kronos, 
Granting,  and  yet  withholding,  hath  giv'n  dominion  and  worship : 
Valour,  the  greatest  strength,  and  the  root  of  pow'r,  hath  denied  thee. 
And  dost  thou  really  believe  that  the  stalwart  sons  of  Achaia,        (40) 
Courage  and  honour  forgetting,  will  act  as  thy  madness  advises? 
Go  thyself,  if  such  be  thy  mind!     Return  to  thy  country. 
There  are  thy  ships.     Nought  bars  the   way.     They  are  ready  for 

launching 
Close  to- the  sea; — each  vessel  that  followed  thee  here  from  Mycenae. 
All  the  rest  of  the  long-tressed  Greeks,  still  true  to  their  purpose, 
Here  will  remain,  and  will  capture  Troy.    And  if  all  should  forsake  us, 
All  should  fly  with  thee  to  the  dear-lov'd  land  of  their  fathers, 
Sthenelus  still  and  myself  will  fight  it  out,  until  Ilion 
Fairly  be   brought   to  her  end:  for  in  God's  own  might  came  we 
hither." 

Thus  he  spake.     Then  shouted  aloud  the  sons  of  Achaia,     (50) 
List'ning  with  wonder  and  joy  to  the  words  of  brave  Diomedes. 
Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  horseman,  rose,  and  addressed  him : 
"Tydeus'  son!  thou  bravest  by  far  of  our  host  in  the  combat, 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  175 

And.  of  thine  equals  in  years,  our  most  distinguished  in  council, 
None  of  the  Greeks  thy  words  will  censure,  or  call  them  in  question. 
Though  thou  hast  left  unspoken  the  one  chief  point  of  the  matter. 
Young  as  thou  art  (for  my  youngest  sons  in  years  would  surpass  thee), 
Yet  hast  thou  brought,  both  ably  and  well,  to  the  ears  of  our  princes 
Much  that  concerns  them  to  hear:  for  in  justice  and  truth  hast  thou 

spoken. 
I,  as  so  much  thy  senior,  will  enter  at  large  on  the  subject,     (60) 
Uttering  the  thought  thou  hast  left  unsaid  ;  and  hardly  will  any 
Lightly  regard  my  Avords  :  not  ev'n  our  prince,  Agamemnon. 
Hated,  cut  off  from  kindred,  laws,  and  home,  is  the  monster ^ 
He  who  delights  in  the  horrors  of  civil  strife  and  disunion. 
Xow  however  to  night's  dark  pow'r  let  us  yield,  and  apportion 
Every  man  a  plenteous  meal.     Let  a  guard  be  appointed, 
Camping  within  the  trench,  but  beyond  the  line  of  our  rampart. 
This,    their    charge,    to    our    youth  I    commend.       But    do    thou, 

Agamemnon, 
Taking  the  lead  as  supreme  in  command,  assemble  the  elders, 
As  to  a  splendid  feast,  in  thy  tents,  one  worthy  thy  station.     (70) 
Plenty  of  wine  hast  thou  there  in  store,  which  the  ships  of  Achaia 
Day  by  day  from  the  Thracian   shore   transport  to  supply  thee. 
Ev'ry  appliance  is  thine,  and  all  will  attend   on  their  sov'reign. 
Then  let  the  chiefs  consult,  and  of  all  the  counsel  they  offer, 
Choose    thou    the    wisest    and    best.     Good   need   hath    Greece    of 

suggestions, 
Prudent  at  once  and  bold,  when  the  fires  of  the  Trojans  around  us 
Blaze  so  fearfully  near:  a  sight  unused  and  unwelcome  ! 
And  on  this  night's  decision  depends  the  fate  of  our  army." 

Thus  he  spake.     All  heard  with  attention  and  ready  compliance. 
Forth   then  issued   the  guard,    well  armed   and    equipped,  to   their 

station :  (80) 

These  Thrasymedes  led,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people; 
Those  Ascalaphus  brave  and  Ialmenus,  offspring  of  Ares; 
Great  Meriones  some,  Aphareus  and  Deipyrus  others; 
Others  the  royal  Creion's  son,  divine  Lycomedes. 
Sev'n  were  the  chiefs  of  the  guard,  and  a  chosen  band  of  a  hundred 


76  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 


Followed  each  chief;  and  sharp  and  long  were  the  spears  that  they 

carried. 
Soon  they  reached  the  space  betwixt  the  trench  and  the  rampart; 
There  they  kindled  their  fires,  each  man  for  his  supper  preparing. 

Atreus'  son,  meanwhile,  the  sagest  chiefs  of  the  Grecians 
All  in  his  tent  convened,  where  a  strength'ning  meal  was  provided.  (90) 
Each  man,  laying  his  hand  on  the  plenteous  viands  before  him, 
Hunger  and  thirst  in  haste  appeased;  then  betook  them  to  counsel. 
Nestor  then,  whose  advice  had  been  first  approved  in  th'  assembly, 
Thus  introduced,   in  courteous  words,   his  intended  proposal, 
Wisely  and  kindly  counselling  all ;  and  addressed  Agamemnon  : 

"Atreus'  son,   most  glorious,   thou  king  of  men,   Agamemnon, 
All  that  I  have  to  say  will  refer  to   thyself,  the  beginning, 
Ev'n  as  the  end  of  my  theme.     Great  Zeus  hath  giv'n  thee  dominion 
Over  the  nations,  and  made  thee  the  source  of  justice  and  counsel; 
Thee  it  becomes  not  alone  to  speak  thy  mind,  but  attentive  (100) 
Hear  the  advice  of  others,  and  weighing  it  well  in  thy  judgment, 
Use  it,  if  good.     The  advice  is  theirs,  but  thine  is  the  action. 
Therefore  I  speak,  and  declare  what  I  deem  the  best  and  the  wisest. 
None  will  offer  thee  juster  advice,  or  propound  an  opinion 
Better  than  mine.    Unchanged  I  hold  it  now,   as  I    held   it 
Then,  when,  in  pride  of  thy  lofty  descent,  thou  anger'dst  Achilles, 
Tearing  away  from  his  tent  his  prize,  the  damsel  Briseis, 
Much  against  my  advice,  for  much  I   urged  to  dissuade  thee. 
Carried  away  by  thy  haughty  spirit,  our  bravest  of  heroes, 
One  whom  the  Gods  delight  to  honour,  thus  didst  thou  outrage,  (no) 
And   even  yet   detain'st  his  prize.     Consider  we  therefore 
If  we  may  yet    succeed  in  appeasing  his  wrath  by  entreaty, 
Costly  and  pleasing  gifts,  or  soothing  words  of  persuasion." 

Promptly  thus   the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon  responded  : 
"Nestor!  the  fault  of  thy  prince  thou  hast  all  too  truly  related. 
Much  have  I  erred.     I  admit  it  myself.     That  man  must  be  reckoned 
Equal  to  hosts  in  himself  whom   Zeus  so  loves  and  avenges, 
Honours  in  our  distress  and  wreaks   such  wrath  on   the   Grecians. 
Erring,  however,  I  fain  would  retract.     Misled  by  my  temper,     (119) 
Now  would  I  make  amends  and  with  costly  presents  appease  him. 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  177 

Therefore,  in  presence  of  all  will  I  name  the  gifts  I  shall  offer, 
Sev'n  fair  tripods  untouch'd  by  lire;    of  gold  ten  talents; 
Twenty  refulgent  vases ;    and  twelve  strong  coursers,  in  races 
Ever  victorious,  who  many  a  prize  have  won  by  their  neetness. 
Xo  poor  man  would  he  be,  ungifted  with  worldly  possessions, 
Badly  provided  with  precious  gold,  who  could  boast  him  of  prizes 
Such  as  those  noble  steeds  have  won  for  me  by  their  running. 
Sev'n  fair  Lesbian  maids  will  I  give,   accomplished  in  all  things, 
Beauteous  beyond  the  common  lot  of  their  sex  or  their  nation, 
Whom  for  my  own  I  chose  when  Lesbos  fell  to  his  prowess.  (130) 
These  will  I  give;  and  with  them  restore  the  cause  of  our  quarrel, 
Her  whom  I  took,  Briseis  herself.     And  this  I  declare  too, 
This  with  a  solemn  oath  I  swear,  that  pure  and  unspotted, 
Stainless  from  love  of  mine,  to  her  former  lord  I  return  her. 
This   shall   be   done   at    once :    but    whene'er    it    shall    please    the 

immortals 
Into  our  hands  to  deliver  the  mighty  city  of  Priam, 
Then  let  him  load  his  ships  with  gold  and  brass  :    let  him  enter 
Victor,  and  claim  his  share  when  the  Greeks  the  spoil  are  dividing. 
Let  him  select  for  himself  from  among  the  captives  of  Troia 
Twenty,  who  yield  to  none  but  to  Argive  Helen  in  beauty.    (140) 
Argos  attained,  that  central  source  of  wealth  to  Achaia, 
Him  for  my  son-in-law  will  I  take,  not  less  than  Orestes 
Honoured,  my  much-lov'd  son  there  nurtured  in  wealth  and  abund- 
ance. 
Three  fair  daughters  are  mine,  in  the  gorgeous  halls  of  my  palace 
Blooming — Laodice,   Clrrysbthemis,   Iphianassa  : 
One  let  him  wed,  whiche'er  he  shall  choose,  and  home  to  his  father 
Lead  her.     I  ask  no  dower  from  him:  but  richly  on  my  part 
Dow'r  will  confer,  such  as  no  man  hath  e'er  bestowed  on  a  daughter. 
Sev'n  fair  towns  shall  be  his;  walled  cities,  ample  and  wealthy, 
Enope,  Cardamylos,  Ire,  surrounded  with  pastures,  (I5°) 

Pherse's  holy  walls,  and  the  rich  deep-swarded  Antheia, 
Fair  iEpeia,  and  Pedasus,  widely  famed  for  its  vineyards, 
All  of  them  near  the  sea,  on  the  sandy  confines  of  Pylos, 
Held  by  a  race  with  flocks  and  cattle  richly  provided, 


178  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Who  like  a  god  their  king  still  honour  with  gifts  and  with  offerings, 
Yielding  an  ample  revenue,  and  bending  low  to  his  sceptre. 
All  in  good  faith  will  I  give:  let  him  only  desist  from  his  anger. 
Then  let  him  yield  to  persuasion.     The  Pow'r  of  implacable  Hades 
Mortals,  alone  of  the  Gods,  detest ;   the  stern,  the  unbending. 
Me  may  he  meetly  obey;    for  higher  I  rank  as  a  sov'reign,     (160) 
Older  too,  and  entitled  to  claim  respect  as  his  senior." 

Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight,  responding,  addressed  him: 
"Atreus'  son,  most  glorious!    thou  king  of  men,  Agamemnon! 
Gifts  well  worthy  a  prince  dost  thou  offer  to  royal  Achilles. 
Haste  then.    Choose  we  at  once  some  chiefs  of  rank  who  thy  message 
Fitly  may  bear,  and  with  due  respett,  to  the  tent  of  Achilles. 
Come!     It  were  better  I  name  them  myself.     Let  them  go  at  my 

bidding. 
Phoenix,  belov'd  of  Zeus,  be  the  first.     Let  him  lead,  as  the  elder: 
Aias  the  greater  then,  and  with  these  the  godlike  Odysseus, 
Hodius  next,  and  Eurybates  follow,  in  train,  as  their  heralds.   (170) 
Now  bring  water,  our  hands  to  lave.     From  words  of  ill  omen 
All  abstain.     And  to  Zeus  supreme  let  us  pray  that  he  spare  us." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  all  approved  the  counsel  he  offered. 
Forthwith  on  all  their  hands  was  water  poured  by  the  heralds. 
Filled    to   the   brim    with   wine    then    flagons   were   brought   by   th' 

attendants, 
Which  into  goblets  poured  they  handed  round  to  the  chieftains. 
Each  his  libation  made  to  the  Gods;  then  drank,  and  departed 
One  by  one  from  the  tent  of  Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon. 
Many  a  caution  that  ancient  knight,  Gerenian  Nestor, 
Both  by  his  looks  and  words  conveyed  to  the  three;  (to  Odysseus  (180) 
Chiefly)  how  they  might  best  persuade  the  noble  Achilles. 
Shaping  their  course  by  the  loud-resounding  shore  of  the  ocean. 
Much  they  prayed  to   the    Pow'r   who    shakes   the   wide   earth   he 

encircles 
Words  to  inspire,  which  might  bend  the  angry  resolve  of  Peleides. 

Now  to  the  tents  of  the   Myrmidon   host  they  came,  and   their 
gallies. 
There  Achilles  they  found,  with  the  harp's  harmonious  numbers 


Book  IX.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.

Soothing  his  angry  soul.     (The  lyre  was  mounted  in  silver 
Richly  wrought,  which  he  won  in  the  spoil  of  Eetion's  city.) 
Warmed  with  the  thoughts  of  their  glory,  he  sang  the  achievements 

of  heroes. 
Opposite  sate  Patroclus  alone,  who  listened  in  silence,  (I9°) 

Following  the  strain,  and  awaiting  his  friend's  commands  on  its  ending. 
Nearer  now  they  approached,  divine  Odysseus  preceding, 
And  in  his  presence  stood.     Surprised,  up  started  Achilles, 
Holding  the  lyre  in  his  hand,  from  the  seat  where  late  he  was  sitting. 
Up  sprang  Patroclus  too,  when  he  saw  the  Princes  advancing. 
Cordially  taking  their  hands,  then  thus  Achilles  addressed  them: 
"Welcome,  my  friends!  for  as  friends  ye  come;  on  some  pressing 

occasion 
Doubtless;  belov'd  the  best  among  all  the  Greeks  who  have  wronged 

me." 
Thus  having  said,  to  the  tent  he  led  them  onward  and  placed  them 
Seated  on  couches  with  tapestry  spread  and  carpets  of  purple.       (200) 
Then,  to  Patroclus  turning,  who  near  them  stood,  he  addressed  him : 
"Son  of  Menoetius!   bring  forth  a  larger  bowl:   and  produce  us 
Purer  and  richer  wine;  and  for  each  be  a  goblet  provided. 
Friends  most  honour'd  and  lov'd  beneath  my  roof  are  assembled." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  Patroclus  obeyed  the  words  of  his  comrade. 
He  meanwhile  by  the  fire  had  placed  a  dish,  and  upon  it 
Side  by  side  had  laid  the  chines  of  a  sheep  and  a  he-goat, 
Adding  a  flitch  all  streaked  with  fat  from  the  side  of  a  porket. 
This  Automedon  held,  while  Achilles  cut  them  in  portions, 
Skilfully  parting  the  joints,  and  stuck  them  on  spits  to  be  roasted.  (210) 
Godlike  Menoetius'  son  then  fed  the  fire,  and  it  blazed  forth 
Brightly  and  high.     When  the  flames   at  length  grew  languid,  and 

faded, 
Spreading  the  embers  abroad,  the  spits  he  supported  above  them, 
Sprinkling  the  flesh  with  sacred  salt,  as  they  turned  on  the  sockets. 
Soon  as  the  meat  was  dressed,  on  plates  it  was  laid;  and  Patroclus 
Brought  forth  bread  from  his  store,  and  in  baskets  fair  on  the  table 
Placed  it.     Achilles  himself  to  his  guests  presented  their  portions; 
Then  took  seat  at  the  board  in  front  of  godlike  Odysseus, 


12- 


180  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Close  to  the  tent's  opposing  wall;  and  signed  to  Patroclus 
Offering  due  to  the  Gods  to  make.    This  he  cast  on  the  embers.  (220) 
Each  then  laid  his  hand  on  the  plenteous  viands  before  him. 
Now  when  hunger  and  thirst  were  appeased   and   the   meal  was 

concluded, 
Aias  nodded  to  Phoenix.     Odysseus,  the  signal  observing, 
Filled  forth  a  goblet  of  mighty  wine,  thus  pledging  Achilles : 
"Health   to   thee,    noble   Achilles!     Good   cheer   hast   thou   amply 

provided. 
Never  within  thy  tents,  nor  in  those  of  royal  Atreides, 
Priiicely  7-eceptio?i  fails,  nor  lacks  there  abundance  and  welcome. 
Matter  however  more  grave  than  feasts  now  claims  our  attention. 
Over  our  host,  O  belov'd  of  Zeus!    a  heavy  disaster 
Visibly  hangs:  and  the  question — to  save  our  fleet  or  to  lose  it — 
Only  on   thee    depends:    Wilt  thou  gird  up   thy   strength  to  assist 

us?  (231) 

Close  to  our  ships  and  rampart  wall  encamped  are  the  Trojans, 
Fierce,  exulting,  and  all  their  allies  far  summoned  to  aid  them. 
All  around  through  their  host  their  watch-fires  blaze ;  and  they  threaten 
Not  to  desist  till  on  board  our  ships  pell-mell  they  have  chased  us. 
Zeus  with  fav'ring  signs  and  with  heav'n-sent  lightning  assists  them. 
Hector,  grim  with  fury,  comes  on  in  his  might  and  his  valour, 
Men  nor  Gods  he  regards  in  the  headlong  rage  which  has  seized  him. 
Zeus  for  his  friend  he  boasts  and  sets  all  else  at  defiance. 
Eagerly  longing  he  prays  for  dawn,  when  he  trusts  to  destroy  us,  (240) 
Carry  away  in  triumph  the  lofty  prows  of  our  vessels, 
Burn  our  ships  with  fire,  and  ourselves,  o'erwhelm'd  and  confounded, 
Blinded  with  eddying  smoke  and  involving  flame,  to  extirpate. 
These  are  no  empty  threats :  and  sore  is  our  dread  lest  th'  immortals 
Bring  them  to  pass,  and  by  fate's  decree  our  armies  should  perish, 
Leaving  their  bones  on  Troia's  shore,  afar  from  their  country. 
Up  then!  though  late;  thou  canst,  if  thou  wilt;  and  save  the  Achaians, 
Fainting  and  sore  distressed,  from  the  whelming  rush  of  the  Trojans. 
Think  of  it  well:  for  bitter  will  be  thy  grief  and  repentance 
When  the  disaster  has  fall'n,  irreversible,  fatal.     Bethink  thee  (250) 
Yet  thou  hast  time  to  avert  the  evil  day  from  the  Grecians. 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  181 


Oh!    my  friend!  remember  the  counsel  Peleus  thy  father 
Gave  thee  when  first  from  Phthia  to  join  Agamemnon  he  sent  thee. 
* Hear  me,  my  son!'  he  said,  'with  valour  Athena  and  Here, 
Richly,  if  such  be  their  will,  may  endow  thee.      Be    thine,    in   thy 

bosom, 
Haughty  and  violent  thoughts  to  restrain.     Be  kindly  and  gentle, 
Cease  from  contention,  and  baneful  strife  eschew ;  and  the  Grecians 
Old  and  young  will  acknowledge  thy  worth,   and  learn  to  respect 

thee.' 
Such  was  thy  father's  counsel:    forgotten,  alas!    Be  entreated! 
Cease  from  the  rage  which  gnaws  thy  heart!     On   his   part   Aga- 
memnon (260) 
Deeply  repents,  and  will  gladly  appease  thy  wrath  by  concessions. 
Noble  gifts — if  I  might — wilt  thou  hear  me  out? — has  he  offered: 
These,  in  his  tent  which  but  now  we  left,  he  promised  to  give  thee : 
Sev'n  fair  tripods  untouched  by  fire;  of  gold  ten  talents; 
Twenty  refulgent  vases ;  and  twelve  strong  coursers,  in  races 
Ever  victorious,  who  many  a  prize  have  won  by  their  fleetness. 
No  poor  man  would  he  be,  ungifted  with  worldly  possessions, 
Badly  provided  with  precious  gold,  who  could  boast  him  of  prizes 
Such  as  those  noble  steeds  have  won  for  our  King  by  their  running. 
Sev'n  fair  Lesbian  maids  will  he  give,  accomplished  in  all  things,  (270) 
Beauteous  beyond  the  common  lot  of  their  sex  or  their  nation, 
Whom  for  his  own  he  chose,  when  Lesbos  fell  to  thy  prowess, 
These  will  he  give;  and  with  them  restore  the  canse  of  your  quarrel, 
Her  whom  he  took,  Briseis  herself.     And  this  he  declares  too, 
This  with  a  solemn  oath  doth  he  swear,  that  pure  and  unspotted, 
Stainless  from  touch  of  his,  to  her  former  lord  he  restores  her. 
This  shall  be  done  at  once :  but  whene'er  it  shall  please  the  immortals 
Into  our  hands  to  deliver  the  mighty  city  of  Ilion, 
Then,  shalt  thou  load  thy  ships  with  gold  and  with  brass:  thou  shalt 

enter  - 
Viclor,    and  claim   thy   share  when  the  Greeks   the  spoil  are  divi- 
ding. (280) 
Then  shalt  thou  choose  for  thyself  from  among  the  captives  of  Troia 
Twenty,  who  yield  to  none  but  to  Argive  Helen  in  beauty. 


1 82  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Argos  attained,  that  central  source  of  wealth  to  Achaia, 

Thee  for  his  son-in-law  will  he  take,  not  less  than  Orestes 

Honoured,  his  much-lov'd  son,  there  nurtured  in  wealth  and  abundance. 

Three  are  his  daughters  fair,  in  the  gorgeous  halls  of  his  palace 

Blooming — Laodice,  Chrysbthemis,  Iphianassa : 

One  shalt  thou  wed,  whiche'er  thou  shalt  choose,  and  home  to  thy 

father 
Lead  her.     He  asks  from  thee  no  dower;  but  richly  on  his  part 
Dow'r    will    confer,    such    as    none    before    hath    bestowed    on    a 
daughter.  (29°) 

Sev'n  fair  towns  shall  be  thine ;  walled  cities,  ample  and  wealthy; 
Enope,   Cardamylos,  Ire'  surrounded  with  pastures, 
Pherae's  holy  walls,  and  the  rich  deep-swarded  Antheia, 
Fair  ^Epeia,  and  Pedasus  widely  famed  for  its  vineyards. 
All  of  them  near  the  sea  on  the  sandy  confines  of  Pylos, 
Held  by  a  race  with  flocks  and  cattle  richly  provided, 
Who  like  a  God  their  King  still  honour  with  gifts  and  with  off 'rings, 
Yielding  an  ample  revenue  and  bending  low  to  his  sceptre. 
All  in  good  faith  will  he  give.     Do  thou  only  desist  from  thine  anger. 
But  should  Atreides  himself  and  the  princely  gifts  which  he  offers   (300) 
Hateful  alike  to  thy  soul  appear,  yet  pity  the  Grecians, 
Harassed  through  all  their  ranks,  who  like  a  God  will  revere  thee; 
While,  for  thyself,  undying  fame  shall  reward  thy  compliance. 
Hector  himself  thou  mayst  slay,  for  close  to  thy  tents  he  approaches, 
Filled  with  destroying  rage,  and  boasting  aloud  that  amongst  us 
None  may  be  found,  of  all  who  to  Ilion  came,  who  can  meet  him." 

Thus  making  answer,  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"Jove-descended  son  of  Laertes,  inventive  Odysseus! 
Me  it  behoves  at  once  to  declare  and  frankly  to  tell  thee 
That   which   my   thoughts    suggest,    and   my    deeds   will   surely   ac- 
complish, (310) 
So  that  ye  sit  not,  like  cooing  doves,  one  echoing  the  other. 
Hateful  the  man  to  my  soul — as  the  gates  of  Hell  I  detest  him — ■ 
Who  in  his  heart  can  one  thing  hide  and  another  can  utter. 
Thus  then  I  tell  thee  what  best  I  hold — what  course  I  resolve  o?i  : 
Nor  will  Atreides  himself  persuade  me  to  alter  my  conduct, 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  183 


Nor  will  the  rest  of  the  Greeks.    A  thankless  task  have  I  found  it, 
Ever  to  struggle,  and  wage  unceasing  war  with  their  foemen. 
One  is  the  lot  of  the  laggard  and  his  who  valiantly  combats; 
Coward  and  brave  alike  are  honoured,  alike  are  rewarded.        (319) 
They  who  have  wrought  great  deeds,  or  none,  die  alike  unregarded. 
What  have  I  gathered  for  all  my  toils,  my  hardships,  and  sufferings, 
Squand'ring  my  strength  and  my  life  away  in  perpetual  conflict  ? 
Just  as  a  bird  brings  morsels  of  food  to  her  featherless  nestlings, 
Sought  and  procured  with  pain,  herself  abstaining  and  hungry, 
So  have  I  watched  full  many  a  wearisome  night  and  a  sleepless, 
Many  a  bloody  day  have  passed  in  desperate  combat, 
Slaying  the  men,  and  leading  away  the  women  as  captives. 
Populous  cities  twelve,  invaded  by  sea,  have  I  taken; 
Fighting  on  foot  upon  Troia's  soil  have  I  captured  eleven. 
Vast  was  the  spoil,  and  many  and  rich  the  treasures  they  yielded,  (330) 
Nought  for  myself  I  retained.     All  went  to  enrich  Agamemnon, 
Atreus'  son.     And  he,  meanwhile,  at  his  ease  and  inaclive 
Sate  by  the  ships;  receiving  much,  distributing  little. 
Prizes  indeed  to  the  princes  and  chiefs  of  our  host  has  he  granted; 
These  they  retain  entire.     From  me  alone  of  the  Grecians 
Forced  he  my  prize  away — my  beauteous  bride — my  belov'd  one, 
Her  let  him  keep  and  enjoy.     Why  then  do  the  Greeks  and  the 

Trojans 
Meet  in  such  deadly  feud?     Why  led  he  his  armies  to  Ilion? 
Was  it  not  all  to  avenge  the  fair-haired  Helena's  capture? 
What?     Does  he  think  that  Atreus'  sons  alone  among  mortals    (340) 
Love  their  wives?     Does  not  every  man  who  deserves  to  be  called  so 
Love  and  protect  his  own?     I  too  my  spouse,  my  Briseis, 
Loved  from  my  soul :  and  not  the  less  as  the  prize  of  my  valour. 
Now  that  I  know  him  well,  as  the  man  who  has  robbed  and  betrayed 

me, 
Let  him  not  tempt  me  again,  or  think  to  repeat  his  deception. 
Thee  let  him  summon,  Odysseus !  and  all  his  kings,  and  in  council 
Gravely  debate  how  best  from  the  flames  his  navy  to  rescue. 
Mighty    and   vast  are  the   works   which   without   my   help  he  has 

finished ! 


1 84  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Hath  he  not  built  him  a  rampart  wall,  and  a  trench  dug  around  it, 
Broad  and  profound,  with  strong  palisadesyfr;;?  planted  within  it?  (350) 
Wond'rous  works!    But  to  turn  the  assault  of  death-dealing  He 61  or, 
All  too  weak.     No  need  of  a  wall  when  I  marched  with  the  Grecians. 
Hector  then  hardly  ventured  beyond  his  own:  and  to  combat 
Rarely  so  far  as  the  Scaean  gate  and  the  Beech  could  be  tempted. 
Once  he  waited  my  single  assault,  and  scarce  he  escaped  it. 
Now  against  Hector  I  fight  no  more.     To-morrow  shall  find  me, 
Each  due  rite  unto  Zeus  being  paid,  and  the  other  immortals, 
Loading  my  ships.     And  once  pushed  off  from  shore,  thou  shalt  see 

them 
(If  thou  delight  in  a  sight  like  this,  and  choose  to  behold  it) 
Ploughing   the    Hellespont's   wave    in   the   morning   light,    and   the 

rowers  (360) 

Manfully  urging  them  on  with  right  good  will  through  the  waters. 
And,  if  the  great  earth-shaking  God  but  prosper  our  voyage, 
Phthia's  rich  coasts,  ere  the  third  day's  close,  shall  greet  our  arrival. 
There  have  I  wealth  which  wand'ring  hither  I  madly  relinquished; 
Hence  shall  I  bear  good  store  of  spoil,  my  appointed  allotment, 
Gold,  and  the  bright  red  bronze,  and  gleaming  steel  in  abundance, 
Nor  will  fair  dames  be  wanting.     But  her,  my  prize,  whom  I  valued, 
He  who  bestowed  her,  Atreus'  son,  with  insolent  menace 
Tore  from  my  arms.     Go!  tell  him   this:  aye,  publickly  tell  him 
All  that  I  say;  that  the  Greeks  may  hear  it  all,  and  indignant      (370) 
Listen,  if  e'er  henceforth  with  his  gloze  he  seek  to  beguile  them, 
Wrapped  up  in  insolence  now  as  ever.     Ne'er  let  him  venture, 
Dog-like  of  front  as  he  is,  in  my  face  to  look.     For  the  future 
All  communion  with  him  I  abjure,  all  concert  in  action. 
Once  deceived,  once  outraged,  no  more  he  beguiles  or  insults  me. 
Lei  it  content  him.     Once  for  him  is  enough.     And  inglorious 
On  let  him  go  to  perdition;  for  Zeus  hath  deprived  him  of  reason. 
As  for  his  gifts — I  hate  them;  and  as  for  himself  I  despise  him. 
Not  should  he  offer  ten-fold, — twenty-fold, — all  his  possessions, 
All  that  he  has  and  more,  whate'er  he  can  gather  from  others;     (380) 
All  Orchomenos'  wealth,  and  all  the  treasures  of  Egypt 
Piled  up  in  Thebae's  stately  domes  in  boundless  profusion; 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


(Thebae  boasting  her  hundred  gates,  who  from  each  of  them  sends 

forth 
Twice  their  number  of  warriors  bold,  their  horses  and  chariots:) 
Gifts  like  the  sand  of  the  sea  or  the  dust  of  the  plain  should  he  proffer, 
All  were  in  vain.     Tis  not  by  gifts  Agamemnon  can  move  me. 
First  must  I  cease  to  feel  the  rankling  sting  of  his  insult. 
Daughter  of  his  will  I  never  wed;  were  she  ever  so  lovely. 
Could  she,  in  feature  and  form,  contend  with  bright  Aphrodite; 
Vied  she,  in  every  female  work,  with  blue-eyed  Athena;  (390) 

Such  were  no  bride  for  me.    Let  him  choose  some  other  Achaian, 
Some  one  more  like  himself;   some  loftier  prince  than  Achilles. 
For,  if  the  Gods  preserve  me  my  country  and  home  to  revisit, 
Peleus  my  father  himself  will  provide  me  a  suitable  marriage. 
Many  a?id  fair  are  the  Grecian  maids  of  Hellas  and  Phthia, 
Daughters  of  noble  chiefs,  who  rule  our  states  a?id  defend  them: 
Choosing  from  these,  I  shall  find  me  a  wife  to  love  and  to  cherish. 
Oft  has  the  better  spirit  within  me  longed  for  an  union 
Equal  and  well  consorted;  and,  home  returned,  to  inherit 
Ancient  Peleus'  rich  domain,  and  in  peace  to  enjoy  it.  (400) 

What  were  worth  in  exchange  for  life  the  treasures  that  Ilion, 
That  fair  city,  in  times  of  peace,  ere  Achaia  besieged  it, 
Held,  as  men  say,  stored  up ;   a  tempting  prey  to  the  spoiler  ? 
What  the  wealth  which  the  sacred  gates  of  Apollo  the  Archer 
Guard,  in  the  marble  shrine  of  his  rock-built  Pythian  temple? 
Cattle  and  fatted  sheep  may  be  won  by  fighting  and  plunder; 
Tripods,  vases,  and  steeds  whose  brown  manes  float  o?i  the  breezes; 
But,  once  passed  from  his  lips  can  no  man's  life  be  recovered, 
Won  as  a  prize,  or  snatched  as  a  prey;  for  back  it  returns  not. 
Thetis  the  silver-footed,  my  Goddess  mother,  predicted  (4IQ) 

Two  careers  for  her  son  through  life  to  the  death  that  awaits  him. 
Here  if,  remaining,   I  wage  persisting  war  against  Ilion, 
Lost  is  the  hope  of  return,  but  immortal  glory  awaits  me. 
But  if  I  quit  these  wars  and  back  return  to  my  country, 
Glory  and  fame  I  resign ;  and,  instead,  my  days  shall  be  lengthened 
Onward,  far  into  time,  and  death  be  slow  in  approaching. 
This,  to  the  rest  of  the  Greeks,  is  the  best  advice  I  can  offer: 


1 86  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Homeward  at  once  to  sail:  for  in  vain  ye  hope  to  accomplish 
Lofty  Dion's  fall:    since  thundering  Zeus   o'er  the  city 
Stretches   his    guardian    hand,    and    her    sons    fresh    courage   have 
gathered.  (42°) 

Therefore  depart,  and  repeat  to  th'  assembled  chiefs  of  Achaia 
These  my  words — for  such  is  your  honoured  office,  as  elders. 
Bid  them  devise  some  better  plan,  in  the  depth  of  their  wisdom 
How  in  their  hollow  ships  to  secure  the  retreat  of  the  army 
And  of  themselves.     For  this,  ye  perceive,  but  ill  hath  succeeded: 
Since,  my  wrath  unappeased,  ye  return,  having  failed  to  persuade  me. 
Here  however  let  Phoenix  stay,  and  repose  till  the  morrow; 
Then  return  with  me  to  the  dear-lov'd  land  of  our  fathers, 
If  he  desire  to  go:  for  nought  will  I  do  to  compel  him." 

Thus  did  Achilles  speak.    But  the  Princes  heard  him  in  silence,  (430) 
Much  disturbed  at  his  words :  for  he  spake  with  vehement  passion. 
Phoenix  at  length  the  silence  broke,  and  thus  he  addressed  him, 
Weeping  the  while  :  for  much  he  feared  for  the  ships  of  the  Grecians : 

"Such  if  indeed  be  thy  fixed  resolve^  most  mighty  Achilles, 
Home  to  return,  nor  make  one  effort  to  rescue  our  vessels 
From  the  consuming  flames,  such  deep  resentment  indulging, 
How  can  I  e'er,  my  son!  remain  behind  and  forsake  thee? 
Thee  did  thy  aged  sire  to  my  care  confide,  when  he  sent  thee 
Forth  from  Phthia  to  join  Agamemnon's  beleaguering  forces, 
Young,  untried  in  the  wars,  where  men  with  men  are  confronted,  (440) 
New  to  the  councils  where  leaders  win  renown  by  their  wisdom. 
Mine  was  the  charge  to  instruct  thee  in  all,  and  rear  thee  to  glory, 
Sharpen  thy  skill  in  debate,  and  to  warlike  hardship  inure  thee. 
Therefore,  my  son,  whate'er  befal,  will  I  follow  thy  fortunes, 
Nor  would  be  left  behind,  should  e'en  some  god,  of  his  bounty, 
Offer  to  chase  away  old  age,  and  restore  me  to  vigour 
Such  as  was  mine,  when  I  fled  from  Hellas,  the  land  of  the  lovely, 
Dreading  the  wrath  of  my  father  Amyntor,  Ormenus'  offspring. 
He  to  his  marriage  vows  untrue, — to  my  mother's  dishonour,  (449) 
Loved  to  distraclion  a  fair-hair'd  stranger.     And  thus  was  enkindled 
Furious  wrath  at  myself:  for  my  mother  unceasingly  urged  me, 
Clasping  my  knees,  to  supplant  him  in  that  fair  stranger's  affection, 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  187 

Making  her  hate  him.     This  at  her  word  I  did.     And  my  father, 
Soon  as  he  knew  it,  cursed  aloud,  and  called  on  the  Furies, 
Praying  that  son  of  mine  might  ne'er  arise  from  our  union 
Upon  his  knees  to  sit.     And  this  the  gods  have  accomplished, 
Zeus,  the  infernal,  and  dread  Persephone,  sovereigns  of  Orcus. 
Fierce  then  arose  within  me  the  thought  to  murder  my  father. 
This  however  some  god  suppressed,  and  timely  suggested 
All  that  a  parricide's  name  recals  to  the  mind  of  a  Grecian,  (460) 
All  the  reproach  I  should  have  to  bear,  and  the  hate  of  the  people. 
Yet  could  my  soul  no  longer  endure  the  thought,  for  the  future 
Under  the  ba?i  of  my  father's  wrath,  in  his  palace  to  linger. 
Vainly  did  many  a  friend  and  relation  gather  around  me, 
Praying  me  not  to  depart,  and  bent  on  defeating  my  purpose. 
Many  a  well-fed  sheep  they  consumed,  and  heavy-hoofed  oxen 
Slaughtered,  while  mighty  boars  with  fat  rich  laden  and  blooming 
Swaled,  upon  spits  outstretched  o'er  the  flames  kept  blazing  beneath 

them. 
Vast  were  the  floods  of  wine  from  the  old  king's  vats  they  extracted. 
Thus,  nine  days  they  ate,  they  drank,  they  slept  round  my  chamber, 
Keeping  alternate  guard :  nor  once  were  their  watch-fires  extinguished. 
One  blazed  bright  in  the  porch  of  the  well-fenced  hall,  and  another 
Constantly  burned  in  the  court  before  the  doors  of  my  chamber. 
But  when  the  tenth  dark  night  had  fallen,  I  seized  an  occasion, 
Bounded  forth,  having  burst  the  fast-locked  doors  of  my  chamber, 
Easily  sprang  o'er  the  fence  which  enclosed  the  court,  and  eluding 
Guards,  and  female  domestics,  rejoiced  once  more  in  my  freedom. 
Thus  escaping,  I  fled  through  all  the  wide  region  of  Hellas, 
And  unto  Phthia  coming,  fair  mother  of  flocks  and  of  harvests, 
Threw  myself  on  the  grace  of  Peleus  the  king.    He  received  me  (480) 
Kindly,  and  loved  me  well,  with  such  tender  love  as  a  father 
Bears  to  the  only  son  of  his  age,  the  heir  of  his  riches. 
Wealth  he  amply  bestowed,  and  made  me  a  ruler  o'er  many, 
All  the  Dolopian  race  who  inhabit  the  outskirts  of  Phthia. 
Thee  have  I  made  the  hero  thou  art,  most  godlike  Achilles! 
Dearly  I  loved  thee,  and  thou  couldst  endure  no  other  companion, 
Go  with  none  else  to  feasts,  nor  take  thy  meals  in  the  palace 


i88 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  IX. 


Till  on  my  knees  I  had  placed  thee,  and  cut  thy  meat  into  morsels, 
Feeding  thee  with  it  myself;  to  thy  lips  applying  the  wine  cup, 
Which  sometimes  in  thy  petulant  moods  thou  wouldst  spill  o'er  my 

mantle,  (49°) 

Dashing  it  back  in  my  bosom,  in  play,  or  childish  impatience. 
Thus  then,  much  from  thee  have  I  borne,  and  much  have  I  laboured, 
Looking  to  this — that  as  sons  of  my  own  the  Gods  had  denied  me, 
Thee  might  I  make  my  son,  O  divine  and  mighty  Achilles! 
All  my  toils  by  thy  worth  to  repay,  and  in  age  to  protect  me. 
Wherefore,  my  son !  subdue  this  inordinate  rage.     To  be  cruel 
Adds  no  grace  to  a  hero's  renown.     Be  advised,  and  remember, 
Even  the  gods  who  excel  thee  in  virtue,  in  strength,  and  in  glory, 
Yield  to  the  suasive  voice  of  prayer,  and  turn  from  their  a?iger. 
Them  can  a  mortal  man  who  hath  sinned,  or  erred  in  his  duty,    (500) 
Bend,  in  their  sternest  mood,  by  hecatombs  slain,  or  by  incense,     [500] 
Vows  in  repentance  paid,  and  the  savoury  steams  of  the  altar. 
Prayers  are  the  daughters  of  mighty  Zeus.     Their  aspect  is  haggard, 
Wrinkled  they  are,  and  lame,  and  their  eyes  look  askance  from  their 

object, 
Careful  and  slow  they  follow  on  Ate's  steps  at  a  distance. 
Ate  is  hale  and  robust,  and  sound  of  limb,  and  outstrips  them. 
First  she  arrives  in  every  land,  intent  upon  mischief, 
Woes  inflicting  on  men;  while  these  come  after  to  heal  them. 
Whoso  reveres  these  daughters  of  Zeus  and  welcomes  their  coming 
Him  do  they  hear,  entreating  their  aid,  and  gladly  assist  him;  (510) 
But  if  he  turn  him  away,  and  refuse  their  kind  intervention,    [510] 
Zeus  they   entreat   that   he   join   him  with   Ate  in   league,   and  in 

vengeance 
Follow  him  up,  and  wrong  repay  with  bitter  requital. 
Wherefore,   Achilles!   honour  these   daughters  of  Zeus,  and  accept 

them, 
Ev'n  as  the  great  and  the  brave  in  all  time  have  giv'n  thee  example. 
Had  not  Atreides  proffered  thee  gifts,  and  others  in  future 
Promised,  but  still  went  on  in  his  course  of  injustice  and  insult, 
Ne'er  would  I  wish  to  persuade  thee  to  quit  thy  wrath,   and  the 

Grecians 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  1S9 

Rescue,  howe'er  distrest.  But  now  that  he  otters  so  nobly,  [51S] 
Now  that  he  sends  our  bravest  chiefs,  the  first  in  thy  friendship,  (520) 
(Chosen,  as  such,  from  among  the  Greeks)  to  beseech  and  entreat 

thee, 
Thus  making  ei'  ry  advance:  O!  reject  not  the  message  they  bear  thee  ! 
Make  not  their  mission  vain!  how  just  soe'er  were  thine  anger. 
All  those  heroes  of  ancient  renown  whose  praises  have  reached  us, 
Most  illustrious,  howe'er  provoked,  whatever  their  anger, 
Suffered  themselves  to  be  moved  by  gifts  and  earnest  entreaties. 
Much  to  the  point  is  an  ancient  tale  which  well  I  remember. 
Thus  it  runs.     (Your  attention  my  friends  I  claim  to  the  story). 
Once  the  Curetes  fought  with  the  brave  ^Etolian  warriors 
Calydons   walls    around ;    and    great    was    the    slaughter    on    both 

sides.  (530) 

Stoutly  stood  th'  JEtolians  in  arms  in  defence  of  the  city, 
While  the  Curetes  strove  on  their  part  to  take  and  destroy  it. 
Artemis'  wrath  had  embroiled  them,  and  sown  the  seeds  of  contention, 
For  that  ..Eneus  the  first  fair  fruits  had  neglected  to  offer 
Of  that  delicious  land.     While  all  the  other  immortals 
Hecatombs  due  received,  Jove's  daughter  alone  was  omitted; 
Either  forgotten  or  lightly  esteemed.     But  he  lived  to  repent  it. 
Angry  at  such  neglect  of  her  shrine,  the  dart-dealing  goddess 
Sent  forth  a  mighty  boar,  white-tusked  and  fierce,  to  devastate 
iEneus'  fields,  and  wild  was  the  havoc  the  monster  committed.     (540) 
Heaps  upon  heaps  he  tore  up  trees  by  their  roots,  and  their  blossoms 
Rich  with  the  promise  of  fruit  on  earth  lay  scattered  around  them. 
Him  Meleager  slew,  brave  son  of  magnanimous  _Eneus, 
Gath'ring  together  huntsmen  and  dogs  from  the  neighbouring  cities. 
Xo  small  number  sufficed  to  subdue  so  dreadful  a  monster, 
Who  to  his  funeral  pile  had  sent  full  many  a  hunter. 
Then  for  the  head  of  the  boar  and  his  bristly  skin,  did  the  Goddess 
Raise  up  a  might}-  tumult,  a  fierce  and  deadly  contention 
'Twixt  the  Curetes  bold  and  the  proud  JEtolian  warriors. 
While  Meleager,  renowned  in  arms,  took  part  in  the  conflict  (550) 
111  the  Curetes  fared;  nor  around  the  walls  of  the  city 
Could  they  maintain  their  ground,  though  brave  and  many  in  number. 


190  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Wrath  however,  like  that  which  sometimes  seizes  the  wisest, 
Rankling  within  their  souls,  Meleager  conceived,  and  his  anger 
Kindled  against  his  mother  Althaea.     Moody  and  reckless 
Home  he  withdrew  and  inactive  remained  with  his  wife  Cleopatra, 
Daughter  of  fair  Marpessa,  the  beauteous-footed  descendant 
Both  of  Evenus  and  Idas  the  mighty,  bravest  of  mortals, 
Such  as  in  those  days  were  (for  he  feared  not  Phoebus  Apollo, 
Drawing  his  bow  on  the   God,   in  defence    of  his  beauteous  con- 
sort). (560) 
Her  in  their  own  domestic  circle  addressing,  her  parents 
Oft  Alcyone  called,  rememb'ring  the  time  when  her  mother 
Moaning  recalled  the  Halcyon's  hapless  fate  as  Apollo 
Forcefully  tore  her  away :  and  the  name  remained  to  their  daughter. 
Thus  with  his  wife  in  angry  retirement  sate  Meleager, 
Wroth  at  his  mother's  curses:  who,  seized  with  a  transport  of  frenzy, 
Vengeance  invoked  on  his  head  from  the  Gods,  for  the  death  of  her 

brethren. 
Oft  and  long,  on  her  knees,  while  the  tears  rolled  fast  down  her 

bosom, 
Beat  she  the  earth  with  her  hands,  and  called  on  the  dwellers  be7ieath  it, 
Hades  the  gloomy,  and  dread  Persephone,  sov'reigns  of  Orcus,    (570) 
Praying  the  death  of  her  son.    And  the  Furies  from  Erebus  heard  her, 
Dire  and  implacable  pow'rs,  who  walk  in  terror  and  darkness. 
Now  round  Calydon's  gates  the  tumult  thickened.     The  ramparts 
Shook  with  the  thund'ring  assault.     Then  all  the  ^Etolian  elders 
Came,  beseeching,  and  chosen  priests  of  the  Gods  were  deputed 
Forth  to  the  rescue  to  call  him :  and  great  were  the  gifts  that  they 

offered. 
In  the  most  fruitful  part  of  Calydon's  region  they  bid  him 
Fifty  acres,  enclosed,  select,  the  best  and  the  richest; 
Half,  full  teeming  and  rife  with  the  choicest  fruits  of  the  vineyard, 
Half,  already  for  tillage  cleared  from  the  growth  of  the  forest.      (580) 
Suppliant  then  too  came  that  old  JEtolian  horseman 
JEneus,  climbing  with  pain  the  stair  which  led  to  his  chamber, 
Shaking   the    door  for  admission,   and   clasping   the   knees   of  his 
offspring. 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  191 

All  his  sisters  came  and  joined  their  prayers,  and  his  mother 
Begged:  but  the  more  they  prayed,  the  more  he  refused,   and   his 

comrades 
Most  familiar  and  best  belov'd  stood  round  and  entreated. 
All  he  resisted.     None  could  persuade  his  implacable  spirit. 
But  when  at  length  the  conflict's  rage  his  quarter  endangered, 
When  the  Curetes  had  scaled  the  walls,  and  set  fire  to  the  city, 
Then    came   his   beauteous    wife    whom    he    loved,    the    fair    Cleo- 
patra, (590) 
Joining  her  prayers;  and  in  agonized  words  she  depicted  the  horrors 
Those  must  endure,  whose  town  an  assaulting  army  had  entered: 
How  all  the  men  are  slain;  how  the  flames  spread  wide  through  the 

city ; 
How  the  children  are  torn  away,  and  the  deep-bosomed  matrons. 
This,  as  she  urged,  his  soul  was  moved,  and  his  anger  abated. 
Forth  he  went,  and  sheathed  his  limbs  in  glittering  armour; 
And  from  th'  ^Etolian  city  the  evil  day  was  averted. 
To  his  own  heart  he  yielded.     His  country  s  prayers  he  rejecled, 
Therefore  the  proffered  gifts  they  gave  him  not.     Yet  he  saved  them. 
Cherish  not  thoughts  like  these  in  thy  heart,  my  friend,  my  Achilles '. 
Let  not  thy  evil  genius  mislead  thee.     Small  were  the  glory 
Half-burned  ships  to  rescue  with  tardy  aid.     Be  persuaded, 
Come  for  the  gifts :  and  the  Greeks  like  a  god  will  hail  their  deliv'rer. 
But,  if  thou  fight  but  in  self-defence,  unmoved  by  our  presents, 
Conquest  may  crown  thy  arms,  yet  grateful  praise  will  be  absent." 

Thus  he  spake.     Replied  then  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles: 
"Phoenix,  old  and  revered,  my  father,  belov'd  of  tli   immortals! 
Honour  like  this  I  need  not.     From  Zeus  is  my  mission  of  glory. 
That,  perchance,  may  detain  me  here  by  my  hollow-keeled  vessels, 
While  to  my  bosom  breath,  while   strength   to  my  knees,   shall  be 
granted.  (6 1  o) 

One  thing  more  let  me  say,  and  well  shaft  thou  do  to  observe  it: 
Fret  not  my  soul  with  tears  and  laments  for  your  hero  Atreides, 
Taking  his  part.      That  man  thou  must  cease  to  love  and  to  honour, 
Wouldst  thou  not  turn  to  hatred  the  fond  regard  which  I  bear  thee. 
Him  who  hath  injured  me  'tis  fit  thou  aid  me  to  injure. 


192  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  IX. 

Come  then,  partake  my  kingdom;  and  rule,  my  equal  in  honour. 
Leave  it  to  these  their  report  to  make.     Stay  thou,  and  in  quiet 
Pass  here  the  night  in  gentle  sleep.     At  the  dawn  of  the  morrow 
Counsel  we,  here  to  remain,  or  home  return  to  our  country." 

Thus  he  spake:  and  by  nod  and  bended  brow  to  Patroclus  (620) 
Silently  signed  to  prepare  for  Phcenix  a  bed;  and  the  others, 
This  observing,  prepared  from  the  tent  to  withdraw.     Then,  uprising. 
Great  Telamonian  Aias,  that  godlike  hero,  addressed  them: 

"Jove-descended  son  of  Laertes,  inventive  Odysseus! 
Let  us  begone!     Not  thus  shall  we  aught  attain,  or  accomplish 
That  for  which  hither  we  came,  and  now  with  speed  it  behoves  us 
Back  to  the  Greeks  to  return  and  report  the  result,  though  unwel- 
come. 
There  they  sit,  and  expect  us.     Too  well  it  appears  that  Achilles 
Harbours  within  his  haughty  breast  an  implacable  spirit. 
Stubborn,  he  casts  aside  the  love  of  his  friends  and  companions  (630) 
All  the  honour  we  paid  him,  as  most  distinguished  among  us. 
Pitiless  !    Many  a  man  hath  forgiv'n  the  death  of  a  brother, 
Or  for  a  son  accepted  a  just  and  due  compensation. 
'Quitting  the  fine,  the  slayer  remains  in  his  tribe  unmolested. 
Vengeance  and  honour  remit  their  claims  on  the  heart  of  the  injured 
Soon  as  the  ransom  is  paid.     In  thy  soul  the  Gods  have  implanted 
Harsh,  implacable  thoughts,  and  an  evil  heart  in  thy  bosom: 
All  for  a  single  slave.     And  we  offer  thee  sev'n  of  the  fairest, 
Many  and  noble  gifts  beside.     Let  these  then  appease  thee! 
Think,  that  beneath  thy  roof  as  guests  we  stand,  by  the  Grecians  (640) 
Chosen,  to  urge  their  suit,  and  respect  the  claim  which  it  gives  us 
Who  among  all  the  Greeks  most  love,  and  hold  thee  in  honour." 

Then  making  answer  in  turn  replied  swift-footed  Achilles: 
"Chief  of  a  heav'n-descended  line,  Telamonian  Aias! 
All  thou  hast  said  from  thy  heart  direct  I  perceive  thou  hast  spoken : 
But  when  I  think  of  him,  my  heart  seems  bursting  with  anger. 
Ever  the  scene  j-ecurs  anew  to  my  mind,  when  Atreides 
Like  some  worthless  slave  before  all  our  army  disgraced  me. 
Therefore  return,  and  bear  this  message  back  to  jour  master: 
Not  until  Priam's  son,  the  redoubted  Hector,  advancing  (650) 


Book  IX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  193 

Close  to  the  Myrmidon  ships  and  camp  shall  arrive,  having  slaughtered 
All  your  Greeks,  and  consumed  with  fire  your  tents  and  your  vessels; 
Not  till  then  shall  I  care  to  mix  again  in  the  conflict. 
Hector  himself,  methinks,  will  restrain  his  rage,  nor  adventure, 
•Bold  as  he  is,  to  attack  the  camp  and  the  ships  of  Achilles." 

Thus  he  spake:  and  each  then  seizing  a  two-handled  goblet 
Made  libation,  and  back  by  the  ships  return'd,  Odysseus 
Leading  the  way.     Patroclus  his  comrades  and  female  domestics 
Bade  for  Phcenix  a  couch  forthwith  prepare;  and  the  maidens 
Quickly  obeyed,  and  made  ready  the  couch,  thick  spreading  upon  it 
Fleece  from  the  sheep,  with  a  coverlid  fair,  and  the  softest  of  linen; 
Where  the  old  hero  in  comfort  slept,  awaiting  the  morning. 
Deep  in  the  far  recess  of  his  tent  reposing,  Achilles 
Lay.     By  his  side  reclined  a  captive  damsel  of  Lesbos, 
Fair  Diomede',  daughter  of  Phorbas  brave.     And  Patroclus 
Slept  in  an  outer  tent,  and  his  couch  was  shared  with  his  partner 
Isis,  the  lovely  in  form,  by  Achilles  bestowed,  when  he  conquered 
Rock-built  Scyros,  the  lofty  hold  oi  princely  Evenus. 

Now  to  Atreides'  tent  the  chiefs  were  come,  and  the  council 
Rose,  each  man  from  the  place  where  he  sate,   to  receive  them,  and 
offered  (670) 

Wine  in  goblets  of  gold,  and  asked  their  news.     Agamemnon 
First,  as  sov'reign  of  all,  enquired  the  result  of  their  mission. 

"Tell  me,  renown'd  Odysseus!  the  pride  and  boast  of  Achaia, 
Doth  he  consent?     Will  he  save  our  ships  from  the  flames  of  the 

Trojans? 
Or,  still  nurturing  wrath  in  his  soul — do  ye  bear  his  refusal?" 

Thus  to  his  question  replied  the  much-enduring  Odysseus: 
"Great  and  glorious  Atreides,  thou  king  of  men,  Agamemnon! 
Far  from  dismissing  his  wrath,  he  fans-  its  flame,  and  his  bosom 
Swells  with  increasing  rage.     Thyself,  thy  gifts,  he  despises ; 
Bids  thee,  as  best  thou  mayst,  assemble  thy  princes,  and  counsel  (680) 
Take,  how  to  save  thy  ships  and  thy  host  from  utter  destruction. 
As  for  himself,  he  threatens  at  morning's  dawn,  on  the  ocean 
Launching  his  many-benched  ships,  to  sail,  and  leave  us  to  perish. 
This,  to  the  Greeks,  he  says,  is  the  best  advice  he  can  offer,

[Book  IX. 


Homeward  at  once  to  sail;  for  in  vain  they  hope  to  accomplish 
Lofty  Ilion's  fall:  since  thundering  Zeus  o'er  the  city 
Stretches  his  guardian  hand,  and  her  sons  fresh  courage  have  gathered. 
These  were  his  words.     There  is  Aias,  who  heard  them  all,  and  the 

heralds 
Both  in  attendance — prudent  men — who  will  vouch  what  I  tell  thee. 
Phoenix  remains  behind,  in  his  tent  to  sleep,  and  to-morrow  (690) 
Home  to  return  with  him  to  the  dear-lov'd  land  of  his  fathers 
If  he  desire  to  go:  for  nought  will  he  do  to  compel  him." 

Thus  Qdysseus:  and  all  th'  assembly  heard  him  in  silence, 
Much  disturbed  at  his  words;  for  he  spake  with  unwonted  excitement, 
Silent  and  sad  thus  long  remained  the  sons  of  Achaia, 
Until  at  length  Diomedes  rose,  and  thus  he  harangued  them  : 

"Atreus'  son,  most  glorious,  thou  king  of  men,  Agamemnon  I 
Pity  it  is  thou  shouldst  e'er  have  sent  to  the  noble  Achilles 
Proffering  costly  gifts,  for  haughty  was  ever  his  nature; 
Now  to  a  towering  pitch  thou  hast  roused  his  insolent  spirit.     (700) 
Leave  him  alone  however,  to  go  or  to  stay  at  his  pleasure, 
Choose  his  own  time  to  fight,  as  caprice  or  occasion  may  dictate, 
Or  some  directing  pow'r  suggest  the  thought  to  his  fancy. 
Now,  however,  attend  to  my  words,  ye  Greeks !  and  obey  them : 
All  of  you  now  take  rest ;  with  refreshing  food,  and  the  wine-cup 
Comforting  first  your  hearts,  for  in  these  are  vigour  and  courage; 
But  when  the  rosy-finger'd  dawn  shall  appear  in  her  beauty, 
Rouse  up,  Atreides !  both  horse  and  foot,  and  in  front  of  our  vessels 
Set  in  array  and  cheer  them  on,  and  fight  with  the  foremost." 

Thus  he  spake:  and  all  the  princes  expressed  their  approval,  (710) 
Filled  with  amaze  and  delight  at  the  speech  of  brave  Diomedes  : 
Each  man  then  to  his  tent  retired,  first  making  libation; 
Stretched  himself  down  to  rest,  and  enjoyed  the  blessing  of  slumber.

Argument. 


Agamemnon,  in  great  disquietude,  goes  through  the  Grecian  camp  in 
the  night,  awakens  Nestor  and  Diomedej  and  having  sent  Menelaus  to 
summon  the  other  leaders,  they  visit  the  guard  at  the  trench,  and  hold  a 
consultation.  Diomede  offers  to  proceed  to  espy  the  Trojan  camp,  and 
selecls  Odysseus  for  his  companion.  They  set  forth,  and  meeting  Dolon, 
a  Trojan  spy  sent  out  by  Heclor,  they  slay  and  despoil  him,  after  obtaining 
from  him  information  respecling  the  disposal  of  the  Troja?is  and  auxiliaries. 
A  cling  on  this  information  they  enter  the  encampment  of  the  Thracians 
{newly  arrived),  whom  with  their  king  Rhesus  they  find  sleeping.  They 
slaughter  Rhesus  and  many  of  his  companions,  and  carry  off  his  chariot 
and  horses,  borne  by  which  they  return  to  the  Grecian  camp. 


ILIAD.     BOOK  X. 


A  LL  the  rest  of  the  Grecian  chiefs  through  the  night,  by  the  vessels, 

Wrapped  in  refreshing  slumber  their  wearied  spirits  recruited. 
Only  on  Atreus'  son,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Fell  not  the  blessing  of  sleep ;  for  deep  were  the  cares  that  oppressed 

him. 
As  when  th'  almighty  spouse  of  fair-hair'd  Hera  in  thunder 
Mutters,  presaging  the  pouring  rain,  or  the  rush  of  the  hailstorm; 
Whitening  here  the  fields  with  the  thick-falling  snows  of  his  winter. 
There  expanding  the  dreadful  jaws  of  war  on  the  nations: 
Thus  from  the  inmost  depths  of  his  lab'ring  breast  Agamemnon 
Sent  forth  many  a  groan;  for  his  soul  was  troubled  within  him.       (10) 
When  o'er  the  Troian  plain  his  looks  he  cast,  with  amazement 
There  he  beheld  the  fires  thick  blazing  in  front  of  the  city, 
Heard  the  sound  of  the  flutes  and  pipes,  and  the  murmur  of  voices : 
But  when  he  turned  to  the  ships  and  viewed  the  Grecian  encampment, 
Maddened,  his  hair  from  the  roots  he  tore,  and  tossed  it  to  heaven, 
As  in  reproach  of  Zeus ;  his  proud  heart  bursting  with  anguish. 
This  to  his  mind  appeared  the  most  desirable  counsel: 
First  to  resort  to  Nestor,  Neleus'  son,  and  endeavour, 
Aided  by  him,  to  devise  some  well-planned  scheme  of  deliv'rance, 
Such  as  might  rescue  all  their  host  from  the  danger  impending.       (20) 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 


Up  he  arose  at  once,  and  around  his  bosom  a  mantle 
Wrapped,  and  his  sandals  rich  to  his  smooth  white  feet  he  adjusted ; 
Then  o'er  his  shoulders  flung  the  blood-stained  skin  of  a  lion 
Tawny  and  huge,  to  his  ankles  which  reached;   and.  seized  on  his 
jav'lin. 

Not  with  less  anxious  care  Menelaiis'  bosom  was  haunted, 
Sleep  on  his  eyelids  rested  not;  for  he  thought  on  the  Argives, 
All  they  had  to  endure,  those  valiant  hearts,  who  to  Ilion 
Came  o'er  the  mighty  waters  to  fight  and  bleed  in  his  quarrel. 
O'er  his  broad  back  had  he  thrown  in  haste  the  skin  of  a  leopard, 
Varied  with  many  a  spot.     On  his  head  high  towered  a  helmet      (.30) 
Gleaming  with  brass.     In  his  nervous  grasp  there  quivered  a  jav'lin. 
He  to  his  brother's  tent  was  wending  his  way,  to  awaken 
Him  whom  the  Greeks  obeyed,  and  as  some  divinity  honoured. 
Him  he  found,  at  the  prow  of  his  ship,  in  the  act  of  attiring, 
Just  about  to  set  forth.     Right  welcome  indeed  was  his  coming. 
Then  Menelaiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  addressed  him: 

"Why  art  thou  arming  thus,  my  brother  and  chief?    Of  our  comrades 
Seek' st  thou  a  man  to  go  forth  and  espy  the  force  of  the  Trojans  ? 
Much  I  fear  that  none  will  dare  such  risk  to  encounter, 
And  in  the  shade  of  ambrosial  night,  as  a  spy,  to  adventure  (40) 

Into  the  enemy's  camp,  alone.     He  were  bold  who  would  do  it!" 

Then  made  answer  in  turn  the  ruler  of  men,  Agamemnon: 
"O  Menelaiis,  Jove-descended!     Much  it  behoves  us 
Both  to  adopt  some  prudent  and  sound  advice,  which  may  rescue 
Greece  and  her  fleet:  since  Zeus  hath  changed,  and  withdrawn  his 

protection. 
Hector's  prayers  have  outweighed  our  own,  and  his  vows  are  accepted. 
Ne'er  have  mine  eyes  beheld,  ne'er  heard  I  related  in  story, 
Wonders  like  these,  by  one  man,  in  a  day,  devised  and  completed, 
Deeds  such  as  Hector,  sprung  from  no  god,  conceived  by  no  goddess, 
Here  against  Greece  and   her  sons  hath  wrought,   and  woes   hath 
inflicted,  (50) 

Many  and  deep  on  the  Argive  host :  such  woes  as  Achaia, 
Ev'n  to  her  latest  day,  shall  have  cause  in  tears  to  remember. 
Up  then  !     Run  to  their  ships  and  Idomeneus  summon  and  Aias, 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  199 

Bid  them  be  ready,  while  I  to  the  tent  of  Nestor  betake  me, 

Bid  the  old  chief  arise  and  forth  to  the  guard  in  the  trejzches. 

To  that  devoted  band,  proceed,  and  deliver  my  orders. 

None  will  they  sooner  obey.     His  son  is  one  of  their  leaders, 

Merion  too,   Idomeneus'  faithful  friend  and  attendant : 

These  in  the  chief  command  are  placed  and  to  Nestor  will  hearken." 

Then  Menelaiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  responded :  (60) 

"Tell  me,  I  pray  thee,  this  being  done,  what  next  dost  thou  order: 
Shall  I  remain  with  the  princes  there,  and  await  their  arrival, 
Or  shall  I  follow  thy  steps,  having  first  delivered  thy  message  ?" 

Once  more  thus  then  addressed  him  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon : 
"Stay  thou  there;  lest,  intending  to  meet  we  miss  one  another, 
Crossing  unseen :  for  the  camp  is  vast,  and  many  the  pathways. 
Shout,  where'er  thou  goest,  aloud,  and  bid  them  be  watchful. 
Such  as  thou  meet'st,  address  by  the  names  of  their  fathers  or  lineage, 
Courteously  honouring  all :  and  eschew  all  haughty  demeanour. 
Earnestly  bend  we  our  souls  to  the  work  before  us :  rememb'ring,(7o) 
Zeus  when  he  gave  us  birth  ordained  this  heavy  affliction." 

Thus  he  spoke  and  his  brother,  instructed,  went  on  his  errand, 
While  he  himself  sought  out  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Nestor ;  and  him  in  his  tent  he  found  by  his  dark-frowning  vessels, 
Wrapped  in  soft  repose.     His  arms  lay  scattered  beside  him, 
Shield  and  crested  helm,  and  two  sharp  glittering  lances; 
There  too  lay  the  embroidered  belt,  which  that  warrior  ancient 
Girt,  when  for  deadly  combat  he  armed,  and  bravely  his  people 
Led  to  the  fight :  for  he  suffered  not  age  to  deaden  his  ardour. 
Starting  from  sleep,  he  raised  his  head,  and  leaned  on  his  elbow,     (80) 
Questioning  thus  the  intruder  bold  who  came  to  disturb  him. 

"  Who  goes  there?    What  brings  thee  hither  alone  and  uncalled  for, 
Thus  through  the  shades  of  night  when  all  are  buried  in  slumber  ? 
Com'st  thou  for  some  of  the  guards  ?   or  seek'st  thou  one   of  thy 

comrades  ? 
Speak  !    Approach  me  not  thus  in  silence.    What  is  thy  business?" 

Then  making  answer  replied  Atreides,  ruler  of  nations : 
"  Nestor,  Neleus'  son,  thou  glory  and  boast  of  Achaia, 
Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon,  before  thee  stands,  above  all  men

Marked  by  Zeus  for  distress  and  care,  while  yet  in  my  bosom 
Lingers  the  breath  of  life — while  my  limbs  are  able  to  bear  me.     (90) 
Therefore  I  wander  thus — since  sleep  on  my  eyelids  descends  not — 
Sadly  revolving  the  fortunes  of  war  and  the  woes  of  the  Grecians. 
Dread  for  their  fate  invades  my  soul.     All  firmness  forsakes  me, 
All  confus'd  are  my  thoughts.     My  beating  heart  from  my  bosom 
Seems  as  about  to  leap,  and  my  strong  knees  tremble  beneath  me. 
Wouldst  thou,  however,  be  doing, — since  sleep  hath  fled  from  thy 

pillow — 
Let  us  together  proceed  and  inspect  the  guard  that  we  stationed 
Outside  the  rampart  wall,  lest  by  toil  exhausted,  in  slumber, 
Careless  of  all,  they  indulge  and  neglect  their  watch  a?id  their  duty. 
Close  at  hand  and  alert  is  the  foe,  and  great  the  temptation     (100) 
Under  the  cover  of  night  to  assault  our  camp  and  derwhelm  us." 

Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight,  this  answer  returned  him : 
"Atreus'  son,  most  glorious! — thou  king  of  men,  Agamemnon! 
Zeus,  be  assured,  will  never  to  Hector  grant  wThat  he  longs  for, 
All  his  high-raised  hopes.     His  turn  will  come,  when  Achilles 
Rouses  himself  and  turns  from  his  bitter  wrath.     Then  await  him, 
Labour  and  woes  unnumbered,  his  short-lrdd  triumph  to  balance. 
Thee  will  I  follow  at  once.     Let  us  summon  the  chiefs  to  attend  us ; 
Brave  Tydeides,  the  spearman  renowmed,  and  the  noble  Odysseus, 
Aias  the  swift  of  foot,  and  Meges,  Phyleos'  offspring.  (ITO) 

Some  one,  'twere  well,  should  speed  to  call  Telamonian  Aias, 
And  the  redoubted  Cretan  prince  :  for  their  stations  are  distant, 
Lying  away  at  the  last  extreme  of  the  camp  and  the  vessels. 
Now  must  I  chide  Menelaus,  who,  dear  as  he  is  and  respected, 
Sleeps,  and  leaves  thee  to  labour  alone.      This  hardly  becomes  him. 
That  must  I  say :  though  thy  brother's  blame  incur  thy  displeasure. 
Foremost  of  all  should  he  be  to  beseech  the  chiefs,  and  to  aclio?i 
Urge  them :  now  that  so  dire  a  need  is  pressing  upon  us." 

Then  forthwith  replied  Agamemnon,  ruler  of  nations : 
"  Old  and  revered  as  thou  art,  thy  blame  just  now  he  deserves  not,  (120) 
Sometimes  indeed  he  seems  remiss — less  ready  in  action, 
Not,  however  from  sloth,  or  from  dulness  of  thought  or  perception, 
But  that  in  all  he  looks  to  me,  and  awaits  my  commencement. 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  201 

This  time,  however,  alert  and  armed,  he  came  ere  my  bidding, 
And  to  those  very  chiefs  thou  hast  wished  sought  out,  have  I  sent  him. 
Come  now !  seek  we  the  guard,  and  the  chiefs  will  all  be  assembled 
Outside  the  gates,  beside  the  trench  :  for  such  were  my  orders." 

Then  responded  that  ancient  knight,  Gerenian  Nestor : 
"  Then  is  he  free  from  blame  :  nor  will  one  of  the  Greeks  disobey  him. 
Or  in  resentful  mood  receive  the  commands  he  shall  give  them."  (130) 
This  having  said,  he  arose,  and  drew  o'er  his  bosom  a  tunic, 
And  to  his  smooth  white  feet  his  sandals  rich  he  adjusted; 
Round  him  a  purple  cloak  he  threw,  with  a  clasp  was  it  fastened; 
Double  and  ample  in  fold,  and  thick  with  wool  was  its  texture. 
Grasping  his  stout  and  trusty  spear,  sharp  pointed  and  glancing. 
Forth  he  strode  to  the  ships  of  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia. 
Soon  to  Odysseus'  tent  he  came,  Jove's  equal  in  counsel. 
Him  the  Gerenian  knight  in  a  moment  roused  from  his  slumbers, 
Shouting  aloud.     The  call  went  straight  to  the  mind  of  the  sleeper. 
Forth  from  his  tent  at  once  he  came;  and  thus  he  addressed  them  1(140) 
"Why  are  ye  going  these  lonely  rounds  through  the  ships  and  the  army 
Under  the  shade  of  ambrosial  night?   Is  there  cause  of  disturbance  ?" 

Thus  replied  that  ancient  chief,  Gerenian  Nestor : 
"  Jove-descended  son  of  Laertes,  inventive  Odysseus  ! 
Deem  not  amiss  that  we  wake  thee:  so  dire  is  the  need  that  besets  us, 
Come  now.    Rouse  we  the  rest;  each  chief  who  may  aid  us  in  council, 
Whether  to  fight  or  fly.      That  issue  must  now  be  debated." 

This  when  he  heard,  Odysseus  returned  to  his  tent  for  a  moment, 
Braced  o'er  his  shoulders  his  painted  shield,  and  quickly  rejoined  them. 
Next  unto  Tydeus'  son  Diomedes  they  came,  and  they  found  him,  (150) 
Sleeping  without  his  tent,  full-armed :  and  his  comrades  around  him 
All  were  asleep,  with  their  shields  beneath  their  heads.     And  their 

lances 
Fixed  upright  on  their  butt-spikes   stood,  while  the  bronze  of  the 

weapons 
Gleamed,  like  the  lightnings  of  Father  Zeus.     There  slumbered  the 

hero, 
Stretched  at  his  length  on  a  wild  bull's  ample  hide;  and  for  pillow 
Under  his  head  was  placed  a  gorgeous  tapestried  carpet 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 


Him  from  his  sleep  the  Gerenian  knight  approaching  awakened, 
Stirring  his  heel  with  his  foot,  and  thus,  reproving,  exhorted : 

"  Rouse  thee  !  Tydeus'  son.     Is  it  thus  that,  indulging  in  slumber, 
All  night  long  thou  liest;  while  the  Trojan,  close  to  our  vessels,   (160) 
On  yon  height  is  encamped,  and  small  is  the  space  that  divides  us." 

Thus  when  addressed,  from  sleep  upsprang  the  chief  in  an  instant, 
And  in  reply,  with  ready  speech,  this  answer  returned  him  : 
"  Wond'rous  man !     Unbowed  by  years  thou  remit'st  not  thy  labours. 
Are  there  not  many,  younger  than  thou,  of  the  sons  of  Achaia, 
Who  in  thy  place  might  go  these  rounds  and  awaken  the  Princes? 
Surely  such  toils  are  beyond  4hy  strength.     Yet   nought  can  subdue 
thee." 

Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight,  this  answer  returned  him : 
"None  but  the  words  of  truth  itself,  my  friend,  hast  thou  uttered. 
'Tis  not  however  for  lack  of  sons,  devoted  and  helpful,  i1!0) 

No!  nor  of  subjects,  prompt  their  sovereign's  will  to  accomplish: — 
These  might  have  gone  my  round.     But  the  need  is  pressing  and 

urgent. 
Balanced,  as  on  a  razor's  edge,  is  the  fate  of  the  Grecians : 
Life  is  on  one  side;  bitter  defeat  and  death  on  the  other. 
Yet,  as  the  younger,  pitying  thus  my  years  and  my  weakness. 
Up!  and  arouse  great  Phyleus'  son  and  Oilean  Aias." 

This  when  he  heard,  o'er  his  shoulders  he  flung  the  skin  of  a  lion 
Tawny  and  huge,  to  his  feet  which  reached;  and  seized  on  his  jav'lin. 
Forth  he  sped  and  aroused  the  chiefs,  whom  he  led  to  the  council. 

Now  to  the  guards  being  come,  through  their  lines  they  passed  and 
observed  them.  (x8o) 

Sleeping  they  found  not  one  of  the  chiefs,  not  one  of  their  folTwers. 
Watchful,  in  groups  they  sate,  each  warrior  grasping  his  weapon. 
As  when  the  vigilant  dogs  keep  restless  watch  round  a  sheep-fold, 
Hearing  the  lion's  approaching  roar,  and  his  rush  through  the  forest, 
Down  from  the  mountain  borne  on  the  wind,  and  the  shouting  of 

hunters 
Mingled  with  baying  of  hounds,  and  sleep  descends  not  upon  them : 
Thus  from  their  anxious  lids  refreshing  slumber  was  banished, 
As  through  that  dismal  night  they  watched;  with  eager  attention 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  203 

Turned  to  the  field,  to  gather  the  slightest  move  of  the  Trojans. 
These  the    old    chief  with  delight   beheld   and   with   praises    en- 
couraged, (I9°) 
Thus,  in  a  few  swift-uttered  words  addressing  their  leaders: 
"So  far,  good,  my  children!  relax  not  your  watch,  nor  let  slumber 
Weigh  on  your  lids  and  make  you  a  laughingstock  to  our  foemen." 
Cheeringly  thus  having  spoken,  the  trench  he  crossed,  and  the  princes 
Followed  his  steps :  all  those  who  were  called  to  delib'rate  in  council. 
Merion  came,  and  Nestor's  valiant  son  was  among  them 
Whom,  as  they  passed,  the  chiefs  had  summoned  to  join  their  assembly. 
Now  had  they  traversed  the  deep-sunk  trench  and  selected  a  station, 
Where  the  clear  ground  looked  out,  by  the  heaps  of  dead  unencumbered 
Scattered   around :    'twas  the   place  where   impetuous    Hector  from 
slaughter                                                                                    (200) 
Turned,  and  checked  his  victorious  arms,  when  darkness  involved  them. 
Down  they  sate;  and  each  with  each  exchanged  his  opinion. 
Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight,  uprose  and  addressed  them  : 
"Hear  me,  my  friends !  can  a  man  be  found  so  cool  and  so  daring, 
Self-possessed,  and  prepared for  the  worst,  as  to  mix  with  the  Trojans, 
Ent'ring  their  camp.     Some  straggler  perchance  he  may  seize  on  its 

outskirts, 
Or  in  the  camp  itself  some  glimpse  may  gather,  some  notion 
What  they  devise  among  themselves,  their  plans  and  intentions : 
If  to  remain,  by  our  ships  encamped,  afar  from  their  city, 
Or  to  complete  our  defeat,  and  return,  rejoicing,  to  Ilion,        (210) 
This  could  he  learn,  and  eluding  their  guard,  escape  and  rejoin  us, 
Scatheless,  such  an  exploit  would  exalt  his  fame  to  the  heavens, 
Rumoured  abroad  among  men :  and  a  rich  reward  should  it  bring  him. 
Every  chief  who  commands  a  ship,  in  the  fleet  of  the  Grecians, 
Out  of  his  wealth  a  coal-black  ewe  with  her  lamb  shall  contribute, 
Forming,  together,  a  gift  most  rare:  unequalled  in  value: 
While  at  each  festal  board  a  distinguished  place  shall  await  him." 
Thus  he  spake :  and  the  chiefs  assembled  heard  him  in  silence, 
Till  Diomedes,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  responded: 
"Nestor!  my  spirit  is  stirred,  and  burns  to  accept  the  adventure.  (220) 
Forth  will  I  fare,  and  explore  the  hostile  camp  of  the  Trojans,

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  X. 


Close  as  it  is  at  hand.     Yet  fain  would  I  have  a  companion. 
Comfort  it  were  :  and  mutual  support  would  afford,  and  excitement. 
Friend  upon  friend  relying,  each  wit  would  sharpen  the  other, 
Seizing,  at  once,  each  'vantage  point;  which  one,  though  perceiving, 
Left  to  himself  would  be  slow  to  improve,  unskilled  to  interpret." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  many  a  chief  rose,  eager  to  join  him. 
Up  rose  both  Aiantes,  the  two  brave  servants  of  Ares ; 
Up  rose  Merion ;  rose  the  son  of  Gerenian  Nestor ; 
Up  rose  Atreus'  son,  that  spearman  staunch,  Menelaiis  ;  (230) 

Up  rose  Odysseus,  patient  of  toil  and  daring  in  aclion, 
Longing  the  Trojan  lines  to  pierce:  so  prompted  his  spirit. 
These  when  he  saw  come  forward,  outspake  the  king  Agamemnon, 
"Tydeus'  son!  most  brave,  most  dear  to  my  heart!  a  companion 
Choose  from  among  these  chiefs  thou  see'st,  the  best  and  the  bravest. 
Many  are  those  who  offer.     Select  whom  most  thou  approvest, 
Free  in  thy  choice;  unbiassed  thy  mind  by  respect  or  by  favour. 
Pass  not  the  better  to  choose  the  worse  through  fear  of  offending. 
Lineage  or  sov'reign  rank  'tis  now  no  time  to  consider'"' 

Thus   Agamemnon   in   dread  lest  the  choice    should    fall   on   his 
brother.  (240) 

Brave  Diomedes  however  took  up  the  word,  and  addressed  them. 
"Since  ye  enjoin  me  thus  to  choose  my  companion  in  danger, 
How  can  my  soul  forget  the  claims  of  godlike  Odysseus, 
Wary,  and  cool  of  heart,,  yet  bold  of  spirit  and  ready, 
Every  danger  to  face,  and  the  fav'rite  of  Pallas  Athene? 
Wisdom  like  his  through  fiery  flames  would  safely  conduct  us 
Back  to  our  friends.     For  ready  resource  there  lives  not  his  equal." 

Thus  to  his  words  responded  the  much-enduring  Odysseus: 
"Praise  me  not  thus,  Tydeides!  Both  praise  and  blame  are  superfluous 
Here    in    the    presence    of    Greeks    who    know   us    well,    and   the 
time,  too,  (250) 

Presses.     Let  us  begone !     Far  spent  is  the  night,  and  the  dawning 
Nears.     The  stars  in  their  course  decline.     Two  watches  are  ended, 
And  but  a  third  of  the  night  is  left  to  complete  our  adventure." 

Thus  the  chiefs;  and  in  arms  to  their  purpose  suited,  equipped  them. 
Brave  Thrasymedes  then  to  Tydeides  a  two-edged  falchion 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  205 

Lent,  his  own  being  left  in  his  tent  when  summoned  by  Nestor; 
Slung  o'er  his  shoulders  his  shield;  and  a  leathern  cap  for  a  helmet, 
Coneless  and  crestless,  placed  on  his  head:  such  cap  as  to  soldiers 
Undistinguished,  and  youth  untrained,  affords  a  projection. 
Merion  to  noble  Odysseus  a  bow  supplied  and  a  quiver;         (260) 
Gave  him,  moreover,  a  sword.     On  his  head  was  fitted  a  helmet 
Wrought  of  the   bull's  tough  hide,  and   with   many   a   thong   from 

within  it 
Tightly  secured.     Without,  the  ivory  tusks  of  a  wild  boar, 
And  the  white,  close-ran g'd  teeth  in  his  jaws,  which  surrounded  the 

helmet, 
Grinned,  a  sufficient  fence ;   and  of  thick  sewed  wool  was  the  lining. 
This  from  Amyntor,  Hormenus'  son,  at  the  sack  of  his  city 
Eleon,  brave  Autolychus  took,  when  he  plundered  his  palace; 
He  to  Amphidamas  gave  it,  Cythera's  prince,  at  Scandasa; 
Who  upon  Molus  his  guest  as  a  friendly  token  bestowed  it. 
Thence  by  Meriones,  Molus'  son,  to  be  worn  it  descended,    (270) 
Destined  now  to  protect  the  sacred  head  of  Odysseus. 

Thus  were  the  pair  equipped,  having  donned  their  terrible  armour. 
Forth  they  fared,  and  behind  them  left  the  camp  and  the  council. 
Then,  by  their  path,  on  the  right  a  heron  upsprang,  by  Athene 
Sent,  as  a  favouring  sign.     They  saw  not  the  bird;  for  the  darkness 
Hid  him  from  view;  but  his  cry  they  heard,  and  the  clang  of  his  rising. 
Gladly  Odysseus  heard  it;  and  thus  he  prayed  to  Athene : 
"Hear  me!  daughter  of  ^Egis-bearing  Zeus,  who  hast  ever 
Nobly  sustained  me  in  all  my  toils;  who  regardest  my  movements, 
Go  where  I  will.     Now  lend  thy  peculiar  aid  and  protection!       (280) 
Grant  that,  achieving  some  great  exploit,  some  deed  that  the  Trojans 
Deeply  may  rue,  we  regain  our  ships  in  safety  and  triumph." 

Thus,  too,  devoutly  prayed  Diomedes,  mighty  in  battle  : 
"Hear  me  too!  invincible  daughter  of  Zeus,  and  be  nigh  me 
Ev'n  as  thou  wentest  with  Tydeus,  my  noble  father,  to  Thebae, 
When  from  Asopus'  banks  by  the  Achaians  sent  as  their  envoy, 
Leaving  his  friends  behind,  he  set  forth  alone  on  his  mission. 
Peace  was  his  objecl,  friendly  the  terms  he  brought  the  Cadmeans, 
Yet  did  he  find  his  return  a  task  of  toil  a?id  of  danger.  (2%9) 


206  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 

Dread  were  the  deeds  he  achieved,  by  thee,  great  Goddess !  assisted. 
Me  too  assist,  and  protect  through  all  the  toils  that  await  me. 
So  will  I  lead  to  thine  altar  a  spotless  heifer,  a  yearling, 
Broad  of  front,  unbroken,  and  yet  to  the  yoke  unaccustomed. 
This,  overlaying  her  horns  with  gold,,  in  thy  fane  will  I  offer." 

Earnestly  thus  they  prayed,  and  their  prayer  reached  Pallas  Athene'. 
Then,  to  the  daughter  of  mighty  Zeus  having  made  their  petition, 
On  they  went,  like  lions  who  seek  their  prey,  through  the  darkness 
Striding,  through  slaughter  and  blood,  among  thick-strown  arms  and 
o'er  corses. 

Nor  in  the  Troian  camp  did  He 61  or  suffer  to  slumber 
All  that  mighty  host,  but  called  their  rulers  together;  (3°°) 

Thither  they  came,  each  chieftain  brave  and  experienced  leader: 
And  in  their  presence  thus  he  disclosed  the  thoughts  of  his  bosom  : 
"  Where  is  the  man  who,  for  great  reward,  well  worth  his  acceptance, 
Danger  and  toil  o'erpaying,  a  daring  deed  will  accomplish? 
He  as  a  prize  shall  receive  the  fairest  car  and  the  swiftest 
Horses,  with  flowing  manes,  which  Greece  can  boast  in  her  armies. 
Glory,  besides,  shall  he  win,  who  will  enter   their  camp,   and,  ap- 
proaching 
Close  to  their  ships,  their  state  and  future  plans  shall  discover : 
Whether  with  vigilant  watch  they  guard  their  vessels  as  usual, 
Or  by  their  late  defeat  and  the  past  day's  struggle  exhausted,       (310) 
Toil-worn,  and  broken  in  strength,  they  relax  their  guard,  and  con- 
template 
Nought  but  to  speed  their  flight,  with  the  .coming  dawn,  der  the  ocean." 
Thus  he  spake.     But  th'  assembly  received  the  proposal  in  silence. 

Now,  of  the  Troian  host  was  there  one,  the  son  of  Eumedes, 
Dolon  by  name;  a  wealthy  man,  and  a  herald  by  office, 
Swift  of  foot,  though  ill  to  behold  in  form  and  in  feature; 
Only  brother  of  sisters  five.     From  the  host  of  the  Trojans 
Forth  he  stepped,  and  to  Hector's  proposal  thus  he  responded  : 

"  Hector  !  my  prompting  spirit  is  longing  to  try  this  adventure. 
Forth  to  their  ships  will  I  wend  my  way,  and  learn  their  intentions.  (320) 
Hold  up  thy  sceptre,  albeit,  to  Heav'n,  and  swear  thou  wilt  give  me 
Those  brave  steeds,  and  the  car  with  brass  inlaid  and  refulgent, 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  207 

Which  the  divine  Achilles  bear,  when  advancing  to  battle. 
Thus  assured,  will  I  prove  no  idle  scout.     Thou  mayst  trust  me. 
Into  the  heart  of  their  force  will  I  make  my  way;  to  the  quarter 
Where  Agamemnon  lies,  and  where  all  their  leaders  in  council 
Now  perchance  are  debating  the  question  of  flight  or  of  combat." 

Hector  his  sceptre  raised,  and  swore  the  oath  he  demanded : 
"Witness,  immortal  Zeus  !  Loud-thundering!  consort  of  Here! 
None  of  our  Trojan  host  shall  mount  that  car,  or  those  horses     (330) 
Drive,  save  Dolon  alone.     Be  his  the  boast  to  possess  them." 
Thus  he  swore.    But  vain  was  the  oath.    Yet  the  man  was  encouraged. 
Forthwith  across  his  shoulders  his  crooked  bow  he  suspended, 
Flung  o'er  his  armour  a  grey  wolf's  skin,  and  braced  on  a  head-piece, 
Lined  with  a  weasel's  fur,  and  a  sharp,  light  dart  was  his  weapon. 
Forth  from  the  camp  he  went  and  shaped  his  course  for  the  vessels  : 
Destined  no  more  to  return,  and  to  bring  no  tidings  to  He 61  or. 

Now  had  he  left  behind  the  crowd  of  men  and  of  horses, 
Cheerily  pressing  on,  when  Odysseus  heard  him  approaching; 
And  to  the  coming  steps  he  called  his  comrade's  attention :    (340) 
"  Hark!  Diomedes.     Some  one  comes  from  the  camp  of  the  Trojans  : 
Either  a  spy  by  the  foe  sent  forth  to  discover  our  movements, 
Or  some  plundering  wretch,  intent  on  stripping  the  corses. 
This  be  our  plan:  Let  us  suffer  him  first  some  trifle  to  pass  us, 
All  unsuspecting ;  then  from  behind  rush  smartly  upon  him. 
Should  he  by  swiftness  of  foot  elude  our  grasp,  let  us  drive  him, 
Always  farther  away  from  his  friends,  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
And  with  our  threatened  spears  intercept  his  escape  to  the  city." 

Thus  agreed,  some  space  they  stepped  aside  from  the  pathway, 
Crouching  them  down  among  the  dead.    On  hastened  their  vic7i?n,{$$6) 
Thoughtless.     When  passed  such  space  as  the  swifter  mules  on  the 

oxen 
Gain,  when  ploughs  they  drag  from  end  to  end  of  a  fallow, 
Cleaving  the  deep  te?iacious  soil  with  the  glittering  ploughshare, 
Quickly  they  followed  him  up.     He  stopped  at  the  sound  of  their 

footsteps, 
Not  without  lurking  hope  that  on  orders  issued  by  Hector, 
Messengers  swift  had  been  sent  from  the  Trojan  camp  to  recall  him. 


208  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 

But  when  within  a  jav'lin's  cast  approached  he  perceived  them, 
Knowing  them  then  for  foes,  at  once  to  flight  he  betook  him, 
Straining  each  active  limb :  and  they  put  forth  their  strength  to  pursue 

him. 
As  when  two  rough-toothed  hounds  through  the  bush  and  brake  of 

the  forest,  '  (360) 

Train'd  to  the  chase,  pursue  some  flying  hare,  or  a  roebuck; 
Screaming  with  terror  he  flies,  and  relentless  press  his  pursuers. 
Thus  Diomedes  brave,  and  Odysseus,  razer  of  cities, 
Hemming  him  in,  his  retreat  cut  off,  and  drove  him  before  them. 

Now  had  he  neared  the  Grecian  ships  and  the  guard  at  the  trenches, 
And  in  Tydeides'  bosom  the  thought  arose,   (by  Athene 
Sent)  that  some  other  hand  might  arrest  his  flight,  or  might  slay  him, 
Winning  a  cheap  renown,  and  himself  stand  second  in  glory. 
Threatening  then  with  his  spear  on  rushed  at  once  Diomedes. 
"Stop  then!    or  with  this  lance  will  I  reach  thee.     Think  not  to 

'scape  me!  (37°) 

Take  but  another  step,  and  sure  destruction  awaits  thee." 
Thus  he  cried,  and  his  spear  he  hurled,  not  meaning  to  strike  him, 
O'er  his  right  shoulder  glancing  the  weapon  passed,  and  before  him 
Stood  with  its  point  in  the  ground,  upright.    Sore  trembling  he  halted, 
Stamm'ring  with  fear.     Loud  chattered  his  teeth  in  his  mouth,  and 

a  paleness 
Spread  o'er  his  ghastly  face.     On,  panting,  came  his  pursuers, 
Pinning  his  arms  where  he  stood.     Then  weeping  thus  he  addressed 

them : 
"Spare  my  life!  and  a  ransom  accept.     I  am  rich.     In  abundance 
Gold  I  possess,  and  brass,  and  steel  well  tempered  and  burnished. 
All  that  I  have  will  my  father  gladly  send,  for  my  ransom,    (380) 
Soon  as  he  learns  that  his  son  survives  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians." 

Thus  then,  with  artful  address  replied  deep-scheming  Odysseus  : 
"Be  of  good  courage.     Let  no  thought  of  dying  disturb  thee. 
Tell  me  at  once,  and  tell  me  without  reserve  or  evasion, 
Why  through  the  gloomy  night,  when  mortals  sleep,  dost  thou  journey 
Thus  alone,  on  the  way  to  our  ships,  from  the  camp  of  the  Trojans? 
Art  thou  a  plund'rer  intent  on  stripping  the  dead?     Or  hath  Hector 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  209 

Sent  thee  forth  to  espy  our  force,  and  our  plans  to  discover, 
Down  at  our  hollow  ships?     Or  goest  thou  in  quest  of  adventures?" 
.  Thus  then  Dolon  replied,  his  knees  still  shaking  with  terror:    (390) 
"Hector  it  is  who  hath  led  me,  against  my  will,  into  trouble, 
OrT'ring  a  rich  reward :  no  less  than  the  steeds  of  Achilles. 
These,  and  his  glorious  chariot  refulgent  with  brass,  would  he  give  me, 
Would  I  but  go    through   the  night's  swift-fleeting   shade,    and   ap- 
proaching 
Close  to  your  host,  your  state  and  future  projects  discover: 
Whether,  with  vigilant  watch  ye  guard  your  vessels  as  usual, 
Or,  by  your  late  defeat,  and  the  day's  past  struggle  exhausted, 
Toilwor?i  and  broken  in  strength,  relax  your  guard,  and  contemplate 
Nought,  save  at  break  of  day,  to  speed  your  flight  der  the  ocea?i." 

Scornfully  smiling,  thus  replied  the  thoughtful  Odysseus :      (400) 
"High  hath  thy  mind  been  set,  and  a  noble  prize  hast  thou  aimed  at; 
Dread  ^Eacides'  steeds !     They  are  ill  to  drive,  and  submit  them 
Hardly  to  mortal  hand;  and  to  none,  save  that  of  Achilles, 
Goddess-born  as  he  is.     In  vain  would  another  attempt  it. 
Come  now !     Tell  me,  again,  without  disguise  or  evasion, 
Where  didst  thou  leave  great  Hector,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of 

his  people? 
Where  are  his  martial  arms,  and  where  his  chariot  and  horses? 
How  are  the  tents  and  watches  disposed  of  the  rest  of  the  Trojans? 
What  devise  they  among  themselves — their  plans  and  intentions? 
If  to  remain  by  our  ships  encamped,  afar  from  their  city,        (410) 
Or  to  complete  our  defeat  and  return  in  triumph  to  Ilion." 

Thus  did  Dolon,  Eumedes'  son,  reply  to  his  questions  : 
"All  that  I  know  without  reserve  or  disguise  will  I  tell  thee. 
Hector,  with  all  the  distinguished  leaders  and  chiefs  of  the  Trojans, 
Gathered  at  Ilus'  tomb,  are  now  debating  in  council, 
Far   from   the    tumult   and  noise.     For  the   guards  of  whom  thou 

enquirest, 
Chosen  bands  are  there  none  keeping  watch  and  ward  for  the  army. 
All  of  Troian  birth,  who  have  hearths  and  homes  in  the  city, 
Sleepless  (for  so  th'  occasion  requires)  exhort  one  another, 
Sharply  to  watch.     Not  so  those  reckless  auxiliar  forces,  (420) 


14 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 


Summoned  from  far.     These  sleep,  and  cast  all  care  on  the  Trojans : 
Children  and  wives  at  hand  have  they  none  to  render  them  anxious." 

Then  replying  in  turn,  thus  spake  deep-scheming  Odysseus  : 
"How  are  those  foreign  troops  disposed?   With  the  host  of  the  Trojans 
Sleep  they  mixed,  or  apart?     This  tell  me  clearly  a?id  briefly? 
Dolon,  Eumedes'  son,  made  prompt  reply  to  his  question : 
"This  too,  in  full  detail  and  without  reserve,  will  I  tell  thee. 
Seaward  are  camped  the  Carian  troops  and  Paeonian  bowmen, 
Leleges  then,  Cauconians  next,  and  the  noble  Pelasgi. 
Landward    tow'rds     Thymbra,    the     Mysians    fierce     and     Lydian 

warriors,  (43°) 

Phrygian  charioteers,  and  the  crested  bands  of  Mceonia. 
Yet  what  boots  it  to  name  by  name  each  several  nation? 
If  ye  but  seek  the  readiest  way  our  encampment  to  enter, 
There,  at  the  farthest  extreme,  but  just  arrived,  are  the  Thracians, 
Led  to  the  war  by  Rhesus  their  sov'reign,  son  of  Eioneus. 
Ne'er  did  mine  eyes  such  steeds  behold,  so  large  and  so  beauteous, 
Whiter  than  drifted  snow,  and  outstripping  the  wind  in  their  fleetness. 
Such  his  steeds !  and  his  car  with  gold  is  refulgent  and  silver. 
Shining  in  arms  he  came,  all  gold,  gigantic  and  glorious  : 
Wondrous  to  view !     Such  arms  as  scarce  seem  fit  for  a  mortal     (440) 
Here  upon  earth  to  wear:  such  arms  as  a  god  might  appear  in. 
Send  me  now  to  the  ships.     /  will  yield  me  there  as  your  captive, 
Or,  if  ye  doubt,  then  bind  me  hand  and  foot,  and  in  fetters 
Leave  me  here  to  await  your  return.     Returned  ye  shall  judge  me, 
If  I  have  failed  of  the  truth  in  a  single  point  of  my  story." 

Then  with  a  frown  severe  replied  the  stern  Diomedes : 
"Think  not,  Dolon!  now  to  escape,  since  once  I  have  caught  thee; 
Though  thou  hast  told  us  much  that  is  good  and  perchance  may  be 

useful : 
For  should  we  spare  thy  forfeit  life  and  dismiss  thee  in  freedom, 
Sure  may  we  be  to  find  thee  again  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians,   (450) 
Craftily  spying  our  ways,  or  in  arms  in  the  ranks  of  our  foemen. 
Now  if  I  use  a  conqueror's  right,  and  cut  short  thy  existence, 
Greece  hath  one  foe  the  less  to  subdue,  one  traitor  to  punish." 
Harshly  he  spake,  and  in  suppliant  guise  his  hand  while  the  pris'ner 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  211 


Raised,  as  in  act  to  stroke  his  beard,  with  a  sweep  of  his  falchion 
Cut  through  his  neck  at  once,  and  the  severed  head  down  tumbling 
Rolled  in  the  dust,  its  unfinished  prayer  still  horribly  mutt'ring. 
Then  from  the  head  they  stripped  its  weasel  cap  j  fro7n  his  shoulders 
Tore  off  the  grey  wolfs  hide;  his  bow  recurved  and  his  jav'lin 
Seized,  and  to  Pallas  Athena,  delighting  in  spoil  a7id  in  conquest,  (460) 
Godlike  Odysseus  raised  them  aloft,  and  preferred  his  petition: 
"Hail!  great  goddess  !      Accept  these  spoils  !     Of  all  the  immortals 
Thee  do  we  first  invoke.     O  guide  our  steps,  and  dire 61  us 
Where  we  may  find  this  Thracian  chief,  his  tents  and  his  horses." 

Such  was  the  prayer  he  uttered,  as  lifting  the  spoils,  he  affixed  them 
High  on  a  tamarisk's  branch :  there  left  them,  a  mark  for  their  guidance 
Back  returning;  and  reeds  he  gathered,  and  boughs  of  the  tam'risk 
Heaped,  in  a  pile  conspicuous,  to  point  out  the  place  in  the  darkness. 
Then  through  th'  ensanguined  plain,  among  scattered  amis  and  o'er 

corses, 
On  they  pressed,  and  soon  they  reached  the  band  of  the  Thracians.  (470) 
Sleeping  they  found  them,  o'ercome  by  toil :  and  ready  beside  them 
All  their  resplendent  arms  on  the  ground  lay  assorted  in  order, 
Forming  a  triple  line,  and  by  each  his  steeds  and  his  chariot. 
Rhesus,  their  king,  in  the  midst  lay  sound  asleep,  and  his  horses, 
Swift  as  the  wind,  stood  bound  to  the  rail  at  the  back  of  his  chariot, 
These,  perceiving,  Odysseus  at  once  pointed  out  to  Tydeides : 

"This  is  the  man,  Tydeides,  and  these  those  marvellous  coursers 
Praised    in    such    vaunting    terms    by    Dolon,    the    spy   whom   we 

slaughtered. 
Now  be  doing!  exert  thy  might:  for  ill  it  beseems  thee 
Idly  to  stand,  with  arms  in  hand.    Come !  quickly  unloose  them :  (480) 
Or  do  thou  slay  the  men,  and  mine  be  the  care  of  the  horses." 

Thus  he  spake.     But  Tydeides,  with  rage  inspired  by  Athene, 
Smote  round  about  him,  and  slew.     Deep  groans  each  sweep  of  his 

weapon 
Followed  in  dread  response,  and  the  ground  with  blood  was  impurpled. 
As  when  a  famished  lion,  intent  on  mischief  and  slaughter, 
Some  unprotected  flock  of  sheep  or  of  goats  hath  invaded, 
So  came  down  on  the  Thracian  host  infuriate  Tydeides. 


14 — 2 


212  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 

Twelve  had  he  slain.  Meanwhile  Odysseus,  wary  and  thoughtful, 
Fast  as  Tydeides  struck,  came  after,  and  seized  on  the  victim, 
Dragging    him    back    by   the    feet;    thus  clearing  a   way:    for  he 

dreaded  (49°) 

Lest  that  in  leading  them  forth,  the  steeds,  unaccustomed  to  slaughter, 
Freshly  arrived,  and  new  to  war,  at  sight  of  the  corpses 
Startled,  might  rear  and  refuse  on  the  ghastly  relics  to  trample. 
But  when  Tydeides  reached  the  spot  where  Rhesus  was  sleeping, 
Him,  thirteenth,  he  deprived  of  the  cheerful  light  of  the  living. 
Gasping  he  lay,  for  a  threat'ning  vision,  sent  by  Athene, 
Stood  o'er  his  head  that  livelong  night,  like  the  grandson  of  iEneus. 

Cautiously  now  had  Odysseus  the  horses  unbound  from  the  chariot, 
Led,   by   the   reins   conjoined,    and   brought   them   forth,   with    his 

bowstring 
Lashing  them  on.     Of  the  scourge  he  bethought  him  not,  which  was 

lying  (500) 

Ready  for  use,  with  the  arms,  on  the  gorgeous  seat  of  the  chariot. 
Sounding  a  signal  note,  then  warned  he  the  brave  Diomedes. 
He,  meanwhile,  intent  on  some  feat  of  more  terrible  daring, 
Doubted  awhile,  if  to  draw  forth  the  car  by  its  pole,  or  to  lift  it 
Bodily  out,  by  enormous  strength;  or  to  rush  on  the  Thracians, 
Taking  the  lives  of  many,  attd  spreading  a  wider  destruction. 
Thus  while  he  stood  debating,  his  guardian  goddess,  Athene, 
Came  to  his  aid,  and  beside  him  stood.     And  thus  she  advised  him: 

"Son  of  the  noble  Tydeus!     Bethink  thee  now  of  returning 
Quietly  back  to  the   ships;   or   in   flight,  and   pursued,  thou  mayst 

reach  them,  (5IQ) 

Should  some  unfriendly  power  arouse  the  Trojans  against  thee." 
Thus  she  spake,  and  Tydeides  obeyed  the  voice  of  the  Goddess; 
Quickly  the  car  he  ascended;  Odysseus  lashed  on  the  horses, 
Using  his   bow  for  a  scourge;   and  they  flew    to  the  camp  of  the 

Grecians. 
Nor  was  the  God  of  the  silver  bow  unwatchful  or  careless. 
Soon  as  Athena  he  saw  thus  lending  her  aid  to  Tydeides, 
Down  in  anger  he  came,  and  mixed  with  the  host  of  the  Trojans, 
Rousing  from  sleep  Hippdcoon,  leader  sage  of  the  Thracians, 


Book  X.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  213 

Nearly  allied  to  Rhesus  by  birth:  who,  starting  from  slumber, 
Soon  as  he  missed  the  vanished  car,  and  the  horses  of  Rhesus,    (520) 
Rolling  in  blood  when  he  saw  the  corses,  yet  in  their  death-pang, 
Burst  forth   in  tears  and  laments,  and   called  on  the   name  of  his 

comrade. 
Roused  by  his  cries,  the  Trojans  with  wild,  unspeakable  uproar 
Ran  to  the   spot,  and   aghast   they  stood,  when   they  saw   the   de- 
struction 
Wrought  by  men  now  far  beyond  their  pursuit,  and  in  safety, 

Now  when  the  chiefs  had   arrived  where  Hector's  spy  they  had 
slaughtered, 
There  did  Odysseus  draw  the  rein.     Diomedes,  alighting, 
Took  from  the  tamarisk's  bra?ich  his  blood-stained  spoils,  to  Odysseus 
Handing  them.     These  in  the  car  bestowed,  he  remounted. 
Sounded  the  lash  once  more,  and  the  horses  flew,  unrelu&lt;5tant      (230) 
Skimming  the  plain  to  the  hollow  ships,  as  longing  to  reach  them. 

Nestor  first  perceived  the  approaching  sound  of  the  chariot. 
"Friends!"  he  said,   "ye  leaders  of  Greece!  ye  counselling  sagesf 
Is  it  illusion  or  truth  that  my  mind  impels  me  to  utter  ? 
Surely  mine  ears  perceive  the  tramp  of  horses  approaching! 
Oh,  may  Heav'n  gratit  that  Odysseus  and  brave  Diomedes  returning, 
Bring  from  the  Trojan  foe  some  chariot  and  steeds  as  their  trophy! 
Sadly  I  fear  me,  however,  lest  these,  the  best  of  our  leaders, 
Some  mischance  have  befall'n  in  the  whelming  rout  of  the  Trojans." 

Still  were  his  words  unfinished,  when  up.  drove  the  chiefs  in  their 
chariot.  (54°) 

Down  to  the  ground  at  once  they  sprang.  Then  great  the  rejoicing, 
Many  the  hands  extended,  and  cordial  and  warm  was  their  welcome. 
Thus  then,  Odysseus  addressing,  enquired  Gerenian  Nestor: 

"Tell  me  now,  great  Odysseus,  thou  boast  and  pride  of  our  nation, 
Whence  are  these  noble  steeds?    Have  ye  won  them  in  fight  with  the 

Trojans? 
Or  have  ye  met  some  God  in  your  way,  at  whose  hands  ye  received 

them, 
All  celestial,  and  beaming  with  sun-bright  whiteness  and  splendour? 
Oft  have  I  pierced  the  Trojan  ranks  and  mixed  with  their  battle, 


214  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  X. 

Nor  hath  old  age  detained  me  a  laggard  here  at  our  vessels, 
Yet  have  I  ne'er  observed  such  steeds  as  these.     Of  a  surety        (550) 
These  are  no  earthly  herds  spoils.     Some  God  hath  bestowed  them. 
Favoured  indeed  are  ye  both  by  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion, 
And  by  the  yEgis-bearer's  virgin  daughter,  Athene!" 

Thus  to  his  questions  answered  the  deeply  scheming  Odysseus : 
"Nestor!  Neleus'  son!     Thou  glory  and  boast  of  our  nation! 
Horses  indeed  like  these,  or  better,  in  form  and  in  swiftness, 
Might  some  benignant  Pow'r  with  ease  have  bestowed,  had  it  pleased 

him. 
These  however,  O  reverend  sire!  of  which  thou  enquirest, 
Mortal  by  birth,  are  freshly  arrived  with  the  prince  of  the  Thracians, 
Whom  Tydeides  hath  slain  with  twelve  of  his  bravest  companions,  (560) 
Aye,  thirteen;  for  a  scout  we  caught  not  far  from  our  vessels 
Whom,  as  a  spy,  to  inspect  our  force  and  discover  our  movements 
Hector  had  sent,  and  all  the  assembled  princes  of  Troia." 

Thus,  exulting,  he  spake.    And  the  prancing  steeds  and  the  chariot 
Thundered  across  the  trench,  and  the  chiefs  all  followed,  rejoicing. 
Then,  when  they  reached  at  length  the  stately  tent  of  Tydeides, 
Freed  from  the  yoke,  the  steeds  were  bound  with  thongs  to  the  manger, 
Evenly  cut,  and  with  Diomed's  coursers  swift,  in  his  stable 
Duly  ranged,  with  an  ample  store  of  corn  were  provided. 
Dolon's  ensanguined  spoils  in  the  stem  of  his  vessel  Odysseus      (570) 
Safely  lodged  as,  a  votive  off 'ring,  due  to  Athene'. 

Now  to  the  beach  repaired  the  wearied  chiefs,  and  their  persons 
Laved  in  the  sea's  pure  wave;  and  the  gore  and  sweat  which  defiled 

them 
Cleansed  from  their  necks  and  reeking  limbs  with  plenteous  ablution. 
Thence,  restored  in  strength  and  refreshed  at  heart,  they  betook  them 
Each  to  his  polished  bath ;  where  they  bathed  at  ease  and  anointed, 
Suppling  their  stiffened  frames  with  abundant  oil,  and  with  odours. 
Then  to  a  full  repast  they  sate  them  down ;  and  libations 
Poured,  ere  they  drank,  of  the  rich  red  wine,  to  Pallas  Athene'.     (579)

A  T  daybreak  Agamemnon  arms  and  the  Greeks  march  forth  again  to 
battle.  The  fortunes  of  war  remain  doubtful  till  noon,  when  the  Greeks 
prevail  and  the  Trojans  fly.  Agamemnoji  performs  prodigies  of  valour. 
Heclor,  warned  by  Iris  to  retire  awhile  from  the  fight,  obeys.  Aga7nemnon 
is  wounded  and  obliged  to  quit  the  field,  when  Heclor  again  advances. 
The  tide  of  success  now  turns.  Diomede  is  wounded  by  Paris,  and 
Odysseus  by  Socus.  Aias  and  Menelaus  rescue  him,  but  are  forced  to 
retreat.  Machaon  is  wounded  by  Paris,  and  mounting  the  car  of  Nestor, 
is  borne  from  the  field.  Achilles  observes  them  returning  and  sends 
Patroclus  to  Nestor's  tent  to  make  enquiries.  Nestor  exhorts  Patroclus 
to  obtain  permission  to  assume  the  arjns  of  Achilles  and  bring  the  Myrmi- 
dons to  aid  the  Greeks.  Returning  he  meets  Euryalus  wounded,  who 
informs  him  of  the  evil  plight  of  the  Greeks.

T^  OS  now  had  forsaken  the  couch  of  rev'rend  Tithonus, 

Morn  announcing,  welcome  alike  to  Gods  and  to  mortals. 
Eris,  commissioned  by  Zeus,  now  sought  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Rearing  aloft  the  dread   Gorgonian  symbol  of  battle. 
High  she  stood  on  the  vast  dark-frowning  ship  of  Odysseus, 
Whence  upon  either  hand  might  echo  the  sound  of  her  war-cry, 
Here  from  the  ships  and  tents  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias, 
There  from  Achilles'  camp — the  remotest  posts — under  leaders, 
Sure  by  their  valour  and  strength  of  hand  to  maintain  their  position. 
There  stood  the  Goddess,  and  raised  the  loud  Orthian  strain,  and  in 

accents  (10) 

Terrible  shouted  aloud;  each  heart  with  courage  inspiring, 
And  the  determined  resolve  to  fight  to  the  last  and  to  conquer. 
Sweeter  by  far  to  their  souls  was  now  the  prospec~l  of  battle, 
Than  to  return  in  their  ships  to  the  dear-lov'd  land  of  their  fathers. 
Now  through  the  camp  went  forth  the  command  to  arm,  by  Atreides 
Loudly  proclaimed.     He  himself  assumed  his  radiant  armour. 
First,  his  manly  legs  with  the  polished  greaves  he  invested, 
Clasping  them  firmly  on  with  rich-wrought  buckles  of  silver; 
Then  o'er  his  ample  chest  he  braced  the  glittering  corslet 
Erst  by  Cinyris  giv'n  as  a  parting  token  of  friendship,  (20)

Must'ring  their  ships,  and  preparing  to  sail  for  the  conquest  of  Ilion, 
Sent  with  a  message  of  kindly  regard  to  the  sov'reign  of  Argos. 
Ten  were  the  bands  of  azure  steel  which  its  fabric  surrounded, 
Twelve  of  refulgent  gold,  and  twenty  of  tin.     From  each  shoulder, 
Up  to  the  neck,  three  snakes  of  steel  were  twined,  and,  inarching, 
Shone  with  effulgent  hues  all  various — ev'n  as  the  rainbow, 
Which  in  his  clouds  great  Zeus  hangs  forth,  a  sign  unto  mortals. 
Over  his  shoulder  his  sword  he  slung :  its  hilt  was  of  silver, 
Studded  with  golden  stars,  and  a  silver  scabbard  enclosed  it,  (30) 

Fitted  with  golden  rings,  whence  it  hung  by  a  baldric  suspended. 
Next  his  protecting  shield  he  raised,  resplendent  and  gorgeous, 
Strengthened  with  tenfold  brass  round  its  mighty  orb.     On  its  convex 
Twice  ten  bosses  arose  of  pure  white  tin,  and  among  them, 
Central  conspicuous,  one,  of  the  dark-blue  steel,  where  a  Gorgon 
Frowned,    all   ghastly   and   dread   to   behold;    and   round   it    were 

sculptured 
Shuddering  Terror  and  headlong  Flight,  Defeat  and  Confusion. 
This,  at  his  back  when  slung,  by  a  chain  was  supported  of  silver 
Bright,  with  a  serpent  of  steel  entwined.     Three  heads  of  the  monster 
Hissing  three  diverse  ways,  in  a  single  neck  were  united.  (40) 

Then  on  his  head  his  helm  embossed  he  placed,  four-crested, 
Horse-tail  crown'd :  right  fearfully  nodded  the  crests  from  above  it. 
Lastly  two  mighty  spears  he  grasped :  with  bronze  were  they  pointed, 
Sharp ;  from  whose  gleaming  blades  bright  sunbeams  back  into  aether 
Flashed.     Loud  thund'ring,    Athena   and   Hera   looked   down   with 

approval, 
Joying  in  arms  to  behold  the  sov'reign  of  wealthy  Mycenae. 

Now  to  each  charioteer  the  command  was  issued,  to  muster 
All  their  cars  in  the  rear  at  the  trench,  and  range  them  in  order. 
Leaders  and  foll'wers  advanced  on  foot,  full  armed;  and  an  uproar 
Wild,  unceasing,  arose  as  they  took  their  ground  in  the  twilight,     (50) 
Forming  in  line  before  the  trench,  in  advance  of  the  chariots. 
These  came  slowly  behind  in  array.     By  Kromon  excited, 
Burst  from  the  host  a  tumultuous  shout.     Then  down  from  the  aether, 
Torn  by  their  cry,  red  drops  of  blood  came  show'ring  upon  them, 
Dreadfully  shadowing  forth  the  fate  of  many  a  warrior. 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  219 

Not  less  alert,  on  a  slope  o'erlooking  the  plain,  were  the  Trojans 
Gathered  round  mighty  Hector,  Polydamas,  noble  and  stainless, 
Great  iEneas,  in  Troy  as  a  god  respected  and  honoured; 
Polybus  too,  and  Agenor  divine,  and,  the  youngest  among  them, 
Acamas — godlike  men,  the  three  brave  sons  of  Antenor,  (60) 

Hector  upreared  in  the  van  the  smooth  round  orb  of  his  buckler, 
But  like  the  baleful  star  now  blazing  forth  in  its  glory, 
Bright'ning   the    skies,    now   plunging   in   clouds   and   lost   in   their 

darkness, 
Thus  might  the  hero  be  seen;  conspicuous  now  with  the  foremost, 
Now  disappearing,  mixed  with  the  rearward  ranks ;  giving  orders ; 
Flashing,  all  brass,  now  here,  now  there,  like  the  lightnings  of  heaven. 

As  when  reapers  in  bands  opposed,  advance  on  the  harvest, 
Where  in  some  rich  man's  field  the  corn  stands  thick;  to  their  sickles 
Down  falls  the  plenteous  swathe,  and  armful  is  heaped  upon  armful : 
Thus  did  the  Trojans  and  thus  the  Greeks,  in  mutual  slaughter      (70) 
Mow  down  each  other's  ranks.     None  thought  of  flight  or  of  yielding, 
Equal  they  lifted  their  heads  in  the  fight,  and  rushed  on  each  other 
Wolf-like.     Eris  looked  on  exulting,  a?id  stalked  through  the  carnage 
Sole;  in  the  strife  alone  of  the  Gods  permitted  to  mingle. 
None  of  the  bright  celestial  host  were  there,  but  inactive 
Sitting  (so  Zeus  decided),  each  god  kept  close  in  the  palace 
Built  for  his  use  by  Hephastus'  art  on  the  heights  of  Olympus. 
Murm'ring  they  sate  and  accused  the  partial  will  of  Kronfon, 
Grudging  the  glory  his  high  decree  for  the  Trojans  had  destined. 
Nought  recked  he  of  their  murmurs.     Alone,  superior,  and  awful,  (80) 
Wide  remote  from  them  all,  enthroned  he  sate  in  his  glory, 
Viewing  beneath  him  the  Trojan  tow'rs  and  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Marking  the  flash   of  their  arms    on  the  field;    the  slain,   and  the 

slayers. 
Now,  while  the  sacred  day  advanced,  and  the  light  was  increasing, 
Fell  their  blows  with  equal  effect,  and  alike  was  the  slaughter. 
But   when   the  hour  had  arrived,  when  the  woodman   pauses   from 

labour 
In  the  deep  mountain  dell,  and  prepares  his  meal;  when  with  felling 
Many  a  lofty  tree  his  arms  wax  faint;  with  approval 


220  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XI. 

Scanning  his  morning's  work  he  bethinks  him  of  rest  and  refreshment; 
Then,  with  a  mighty  cheer,  and  united  rush,  did  the  Grecians         (90) 
Break  through  their  foemen's  line  with  resistless  force.    Agamemnon 
First  rushed  on,  and  Bienor,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Smote,  and  Oileus,  his  faithful  attendant  who  guided  their  horses. 
Forth  from  his  chariot  springing  Bienor  advanced,  but  Atreides 
Met  him  as  on  he  rushed,  and  deep  in  his  forehead  his  jav'lin 
Fixed.     His  vizor  in  vain  resisted  the  force  of  the  weapon, 
Heavy  with  bronze.     Through  that  and  the  bone  it  went,  and  com- 
mingled 
Blood  with  his  brains.     Thus  fell  the  first  who  opposed  Agamemnon. 

These  on  the  ground  he  left,  in  the  throes  of  death,  with  their  bosoms 
Bare,   and   exposed   to   the   gaze   of  all,   for  he  stripped   off  their 
armour.  (I0°) 

Then  upon  Isus  he  rushed,  and  Antiphus,  eager  to  slay  them 
Both  in  one  chariot,  Priam's  sons ;  one,  offspring  of  wedlock  ; 
One  of  unsanctioned  love;  and  to  him  the  reins  were  entrusted. 
Antiphus  wielded  the  spear  and  shield.     By  godlike  Achilles 
Both  had  been  seized  and  with  osier  bands  in  the  passes  of  Ida 
Bound,  where  their  flocks  they  tended,  and  both  were  released  upon 

ransom,- 
Destined  to  fall  by  the  hand  of  Atreus'  son  Agamemnon. 
Isus  he  pierced  with  his  spear  through  the  breast  and  hurled  from  the 

chariot; 
Keen,  beneath  Antiphus'  ear  fell  the  side-long  sweep  &lt;?/"his  falchion. 
Both   he   despoiled   of   their   arms.     Then   first   their   features  per- 
ceiving (IIQ) 
Well  he  remembered  both  to  have  seen,  when  down  to  the  vessels 
Captives  they  came  from  Ida's  heights  in  the  train  of  Achilles. 
As  when  a  lion,  invading  their  peaceful  lair  in  the  forest, 
Seizes  two  trembling  fawns  in  his  murderous  fangs  and  devours  them, 
Crushing  the  life  from  their  tender  hearts  in  the  sight  of  their  mother: 
She,  although  close  at  hand,  can  help  them  nought,  but  with  anguish 
Stricken,  and  wild  with  affright  breaks  forth,  nor  stays  to  behold  them 
Perish,  but  swift  through  bushes  and  tangled  glades  of  the  woodland 
Flies,  all  trembling  and  sweat-bedewed,  from  the  rage  of  the  monster : 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  221 

Powerless  thus  to  avert  their  comrades'  fate,  and  in  terror  (I2°) 

Each  for  himself,  the  Trojans  fled  from  the  wrath  of  the  Argives. 
Next,  Pisander  he  smote,  and  Hippolochus  fearless  in  combat. 
These  were  Antimachus'  sons,  a  brave  but  profligate  noble, 
Whom  with  rich  gifts  and  gold  Alexandras  bribed,  and  persuaded 
Great  Menelaiis'  claim  to  oppose,  when  his  wife  he  demanded. 
These,  his  sons,  Agamemnon  encountered,  both  in  one  chariot 
Borne,  and  practised  alike  to  fight  or  govern  their  horses. 
Soon  as  Atreides  they  saw  like  a  lion  rushing  upon  them, 
Lance  uplifted,  bewildered,  the  reins  they  dropped,  and  the  coursers 
Reared:  then  with  terror  struck  on  their  knees  they  fell  and  besought 
him :  (x3°) 

"Spare  our  lives!  O  Atreides,  and  take  the  ransom  we  offer. 
Untold  wealth  in  Antimachus'  house  lies  stored.     In  abundance 
Gold  he  possesses,  and  brass,  and  steel,  well  tempered  and  burnished. 
All  he  hath,  without  stint,  will  he  lay  at  thy  feet  for  our  ransom, 
Soon  as  he  hears  that  his  sons  survive  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians." 
Suppliant  thus,  and  in  tears  they  besought  the  king,  and  in  accents 
Gentle  their  prayer  preferred.     An  ungentle  speech  was  their  answer: ' 
"If  from  Antimachus'  loins  ye  spring,  that  wretch,  who  in  council 
Dared  to  propose  to  the  Trojans  the  murder  of  brave  Menelaiis, 
When  with  divine  Odysseus  in  sacred  guise  of  an  envoy  (I4°) 

Llion's  gates,  with  assurance  of  safe  return,  he  had  entered, 
Die!  for  your  father's  monstrous  crime  this  day  shall  ye  suffer." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  Pisander  at  once  he  hurled  from  his  chariot, 
Pierced  through  the  heart  supine  he  fell  and  his  spirit  forsook  him. 
Then  from  the  car  Hippolochus  sprang.     But  the  sword  of  Atreides 
Reached  him,  and  lopped  his  hands,  and  severed  his  neck;  and  the 

victor 
Rolled,  like  a  bowl,  the  bleeding  head  in  the  midst  of  the  Trojans. 
Then  to  the  thick  of  the  fray  rushed  on,  where  the  struggle  was 

fiercest, 
Densest  the  ranks  of  the  foe :  and  the  Argives  followed  their  leader. 
Forthwith   commenced   a   headlong   rout,    where   footman   by   foot- 
man (x5°) 
Perished,  and  horse  by  horse.    Loud  clashed  their  arms,  and  to  heaven 


222  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XI. 

Mounted  the  dust  from  thousands  of  thund'ring  hoofs.    Agamemnon, 
Hewing  his  way  through  the  flying  ranks,  pressed  on,  and,  unceasing, 
Cheered  on  the  Greeks  to  the  race,  and  dealt  destruction  around  him. 
As  when  the  flames  invade  some  dense,  impassable  forest, 
Rolling  along  with  the  eddying  wind  they  spread,  and  the  branches, 
Trunks  and  roots  in  a  mingled  and  blazing  mass  are  confounded : 
Thus,  before  Atreus'  son  swept  down,  lay  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans: 
Prostrate  forms  and  helmed  heads.    Steeds,  guideless  and  frantic, 
Whirled  through  the  gaps    of  the  battle   their   empty  cars,  to   the 

breezes  (I^°) 

Tossing  their  floating  manes ;  while  the  riders,  trampled  behind  them, 
Strewed  the  plain;  to  their  wives  less  pleasing  by  far  than  to  vultures. 
Hector  had  Zeus  withdrawn  from  the  crush  and  dust  of  the  conflict, 
Out  of  the  reach  of  the  weapons,  the  slaughter,  the  blood,  and  the 

tumult, 
While  Agamemnon  pursued  and  called  on  the  Argives  to  follow. 

Thus  the  discomfited  host  by  the  tomb  of  Dardanian  Ilus, 
Where  the  wild  fig-tree  stands  in  the  midst  of  the  plain,  in  confusion 
Swept,  pushing  on  for  the  town.    Agamemnon,  shouting  behind  them, 
Followed  them  close,  his  hands  imbrued  with  the  blood  of  his  foemen : 
These,  when  the  Scsean  gate  they  at  length  had  reached,  and  the 

beech-tree,  (M°) 

Panting  and  breathless,  halted  awhile  and  awaited  their  comrades, 
Who  through   the  midst  of  the  plain  from  Atreides  fled,    like   the 

frighted 
Kine,  which,  in  darkling  hour  of  their  ev'ning  milking,  a  lion 
Scares.     All  fly  in  dismay.     One,  luckless,  escapes  not  destruction. 
Her  with  his  fangs  he  seizes,  and  breaks  her  neck,  and  resistless 
Tears  her  down,  and  laps  her  blood,  and  gorges  her  entrails. 
Thus  did  Atreides  rush  on  the  flying  host  of  the  Trojans, 
Slaughtering  even  the  hindmost,  and  thus  were  they  scattered  before 

him. 
Prone  from  his  car  was  hurled  full  many  a  warrior,  or  backward 
Dragged,  lay  supine,  by  Atreides  slain  in  advance  of  the  Grecians.  (180) 
But  when  at  length  he  approached  the  lofty  walls  of  the  city, 
Then  from  his  thro?ie  uprose  the  father  of  Gods  and  of  mortals, 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  223 

Down  from  Olympus  he  came  and  on  Ida's  summit  alighted, 
Streaming  with  rills ;  there  sate,  his  right  hand  grasping  the  lightning : 
Iris  the  golden  wing'd  then  summoned  and  charged  with  a  message : 

"Hie  thee  away,  swift  Iris!  this  message  deliver  to  Hector, 
While  he  shall  see  Agamemnon,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people 
Raging  in  front  of  the  battle,  and  thinning  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
So  long  bid  him  withdraw;  but  exhort  the  rest  of  his  army 
Bravely  to  fight,  and  maintain  their  ground  in  the  dubious  conflict.  (190) 
Soon  as,  however,  by  spear  transfixed,  or  struck  by  an  arrow, 
Wounded  he  mounts  his  car,  then  strength  will  I  pour  into  Hector 
Onward  to  rush  and  slay,  and  to  drive  the  Greeks  to  their  vessels, 
Ev'n  till  the  sun  shall  set  and  sacred  night  shall  involve  them." 

Thus  he  spake;  nor  did  wind-swift  Iris  pause  for  a  moment: 
Down  tow'rds  Ilion's  holy  walls  from  Ida  she  darted. 
Hector  she  found,  great  Priamus'  godlike  son,  mid  the  Trojans 
Stationed;  around  him  a  close-wedgd  throng  of  horses  and  chariots. 
Close   to  his    car  approaching,  the    swift-wing'd  Goddess    addressed 

him: 
"Hector!  the  noble  Priamus'  son,  Jove's  rival  in  counsel,     (200) 
Hear  the  command  our  father  Zeus  hath  bid  me  deliver! 
While   thou  shalt   see  Agamemnon,  the   shepherd  and  guide  of  his 

people, 
Raging  in  front  of  the  battle,  and  thinning  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
So  long  fight  thou  not ;  but  exhort  the  rest  of  thy  army 
Bravely  to  war  and  maintain  their  ground  in  the  dubious  conflict. 
Soon  as,  however,  by  spear  transfixed,  or  struck  by  an  arrow, 
Wounded  he  mounts  his  car,  then  strength  will  he  grant  thee  and 

valour 
Onward  to  rush  and  slay,  and  drive  the  Greeks  to  their  vessels, 
Ev'n  till  the  sun  shall  set,  and  the  sacred  night  shall  involve  them." 

Thus,  her  message  delivered,  the  swift-wing'd  Iris  departed.  (210) 
Hector,  armed  as  he  was,  to  the  ground  sprang  down  from  his  chariot. 
Brandishing   two  sharp    spears    he  passed  through  the  ranks  of  the 

Trojans, 
Rousing  their  flagging  fire,  and  inflaming  their  zeal  for  the  combat. 
Quickly  they  rallied  and  turned,  once  more  confronting  the  Grecians. 


224  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XL 

These,    on   their  part,    re-formed  their  line,   and  strengthened   their 

phalanx. 
Thus  was  the  battle  restored,  and  opposed  they  stood.     Agamemnon 
Foremost  of  all  rushed  on,  for  he  burned  to  be  first  in  the  conflict. 

Tell  me,  ye  Muses!  ye  who  the  halls  of  Olympus  inhabit, 
Who  of  the  Trojan  host  or  their  brave  allies  was  the  foremost 
In  the  fresh-kindled  fight  Agamemnon's  might  to  encounter.      (220) 
Tall  in  stature  and  brave,  Iphidamas,  son  of  Antenor, 
First  advanced.     In  Thrace,  rich  mother  of  flocks  and  of  harvests, 
Cisseus  had  reared  him,  the  sire  of  fair  Theano  his  mother, 
Ev'n  from  his  infant  years,  and  nursed  with  care  in  his  palace; 
And  when  arrived  at  the  fulness  of  blooming  youth  he  detained  him 
Still,  for  he  loved  him  dearly,  and  gave  him  a  daughter  in  marriage, 
Thence,  on  the  rumour  of  war  with  Greece,  betroth'd  but  unwedded  : 
Sailed  he  with  twelve  tall  ships  and  a  goodly  train  of  his  foll'wers, 
And  to  Percote  came,  there  left  his  ships  and  to  Ilion  (229) 

Marched,  disembarked,  on  foot,  and  joined  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans : 
Such  was  the  youthful  chief  who  first  Agamemnon  encountered. 
Thus  then,  nearing  each  other,  when  now  small  space  was  between 

them, 
First  Agamemnon  aimed  his  spear,  but  wand'ring,  it  missed  him. 
Then  did  Iphidamas  put  forth  his  strength,  and  thrust  with  his  jav'lin 
Under  the  breastplate,  full  on  the  belt,  still  driving  it  onwards. 
Stoutly  the  belt  resisted.     The  brazen  point  of  the  weapon 
Bent,  like  lead,  on  its  silver  plates,,  and  forced  not  an  entry. 
Then  Agamemnon,  enraged,  with  his  left  hand  seizing  the  jav'lin 
Wrenched  it  away  with  a  lion's  force  from  the  grasp  of  his  foeman, 
While  with  his  sword  a  deadly  blow  on  his  neck  he  inflicted  :       (240) 
Thus,  by  too  sad  a  fate  o'erta'en,  while  aiding  his  country, 
Slept  the  young  hero  that  brazen  sleep  which  knows  not  a  waking. 
Far  from  his  virgin  bride,  unwed,  but  with  many  a  present 
Wooed  and  won.     First  gave  he  a  hundred  beeves;  then  a  thousand 
Sheep  and  goats  from  the  countless  flocks  in  his  pastures  he  promised. 
Stripped  of  his  beauteous  arms  he  lay.     Agamemnon,  exulting, 
Tore  them  away,  and  was  bearing  them  off  to  the  host  of  the  Grecians : 
This  when  Coon  perceived,  the  illustrious  son  of  Antenor, 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.    '  225 

Eldest  son  of  his  sire,  then  a  cloud  of  grief  and  of  anguish 
Shadowed  his  eyes,  to  behold  his  brother  slain;  and  unnoticed     (250) 
While  Agamemnon  passed,  stood  back,  and  lifting  his  jav'lin 
Pierced  through  his  arm,  just  under  the  elbow-joint;  and  the  weapon, 
Driv'n  right  through,  protruded  its  glittering  point.     Agamemnon 
Started  with  pain  and  alarm,  but  desisted  not,  nor  an  instant 
Paused  in  his  fierce  career  of  destructive  war  and  of  battle. 
Round  on  Coon  he  turned,  and  upon  him  rushed  with  his  jav'lin, 
Nursling  of  storms.     He  already  had  grasped  the  foot  of  his  brother, 
Dragging  him  back,  and  shouting  to  all  who  were  brave  to  assist  him. 
Him  while  his  bossy  shield  o'er  the  corpse  he  spread,  Agamemnon 
Pierced  with  his  glittering  lance,  and  his  strength  and  spirit  forsook 

him.  (260) 

Prone  on  Iphidamas  sinking,  his  head  was  lopped  by  the  victor. 
Thus  by  Atreides'  arm,  these  two  brave  sons  of  Antenor, 
Joined  in  a  common  doom,  descended  together  to  Hades. 

Now,  so  long  as  the  blood  welled  warm  from  his  wound,  Agamemnon 
Raged  through  the  field,  and  with  lance,  with  sword,  with  ponderous 

fragments 
Torn  from  the   rock-strewed  plain   crushed  down   the  ranks   of  the 

Trojans. 
But   when   the   blood-flow  ceased,  and  the  wound  contracted   and 

stiffened, 
Agony  shot  through  the  frame,  and  subdued  the  strength  of  the  monarch. 
Pangs  like  those  which  women  invade  in  the  hour  of  their  travail, 
Bitter  and  keen,  from  th'  Ilithyae's  stores,  presiding  o'er  child-birth, 
Daughters  of  Hera,  severely  kind,  who  relieve  by  afflicting.  (27*) 

Not  less  piercing  the  pangs  which  subdued  the  strength  of  Atreides. 
Into  his  chariot  he  sprang,  and  the  charioteer  he  commanded 
Swiftly  to  drive  to  the  hollow  ships,  for  his  soul  was  in  torment; 
While  to  the  Greeks,  in  departing,  thus  he  shrieked  forth  his  orders : 
"Friends  and  leaders  of  Greece,  ye  chiefs  of  experience  in  council! 
Yours  be  the  task  to  defend  us  and  save  our  fleet  from  destruction, 
Baffling  each  hostile  attempt:  since  Zeus  no  longer  allows  me 
Here  to  remain,  and  this  day's  fight  conduct  to  its  issue." 
Thus  he  spake.  Then  sounded  the  lash,  and  forth  flew  the  horses,  (280)

226  •      THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XL 

Urging  their  course  with  right  good  will  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
White   were   their  chests  with  foam  and  begrimed  with  dust  which 

beneath  them 
Rose  in  a  cloud,  as  they  hurried  the  wounded  prince  from  the  battle. 

Hector  beheld  from  his  car  with  joy  the  retreat  of  Atreides, 
Then  with  a  shout  exhorted  the  Trojan  and  Lycian  warriors : 
"Lycians!  Trojans!  and  all  ye  brave  Dardanian  spearmen! 
Shew  yourselves  men,  my  friends!  and  be  mindful  of  prowess  and 

honour. 
See  where  he  flies — our  bravest  foe!     Now  Zeus  will  award  me 
Praise  and  enduring  renown !     Up !  put  your  steeds  on  their  mettle, 
Charge  on  these  stubborn  Greeks :  and  immortal  gloryawaits  you."  (29c) 

Thus  he  spake,  in  each  bosom  a  martial  ardour  inspiring. 
Like   as   a  hunter,   who   cheers   on   his   white-fang'd  hounds,  when 

assailing 
Some  fierce  lion  or  rough  wild  boar  in  the  depths  of  the  forest. 
So  did  the  son  of  Priam,  in  might  like  death-dealing  Ares, 
Cheer  on,  against  the  Greeks,  the  magnanimous  warriors  of  Troia. 
Foremost  himself  in  their  ranks,  and  filled  with  assurance  of  conquest, 
Down   on   the-  battle   he   poured   with   a  whirlwind's   force,   which 

descending 
Sweeps  o'er  the  dark  blue  sea  and  chases  its  billows  before  it. 

Whom  now  first,  whom  last  did  the  godlike  offspring  of  Priam, 
Honoured  that  day  by  Zeus  supreme,  strike  down  in  the  combat?  (300) 
First  Assaeus  he  slew;  Autonous  next,  and  Opites, 
Dolops,  Clytis'  son,  and  Opheltius; — then  Agelaiis. 
Oros,  ^Esymnus,  Hipponous  fell — all  chiefs  of  distinction, 
Known  as  the  flow V  of  the  Argive  host:  then  numberless  others, 
Vulgar  of  birth,  unknown  to  fame.     As  the  blast  of  the  Zephyr 
Hurries  along  the  clouds  of  the  stormy  south,  when  the  tempest 
Rises  in  squalls :  the  swol'n  waves  roll,  and  the  crests  of  the  billows, 
Torn  by  the  drifting  blast,  fly  scattered  in  foam  on  the  breezes: 
Thus  did  great  Hector  sweep  o'er  the  crests  of  all  who  opposed  him. 

Then     had    destruction    been    sure,     irremediable    ill    been  ac- 
complished, (3 1  o) 
Then  had  the  Greeks  to  their  ships  in  defeat  and  slaughter  been  driven, 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  227 

Had  not  Odysseus,  the  danger  perceiving,  exhorted  Tydeides: 
"Why,  O  Tydeides,  forget  we  thus  our  prowess  and  valour? 
Draw  we  together,  my  friend !  and  make  our  stand.     How  disgraceful 
Were  it,  should  Hector  thus  destroy  the  ships  of  the  Grecians." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  responded  thus  the  brave  Diomedes : 
"Yes!  I  will  stay,  and  endure  to  the  end :  though  small  the  advantage, 
Useless  all  we  can  do:  since  cloud-compelling  Kronfon 
Sides  with  our  Trojan  foes,  and   withdraws  his   support   from   the 

Argives." 
Speaking  thus,  Thymbraeus  at  once  he  struck  from  his  chariot;    (320) 
Pierced  through  the  heart  with  his  spear  on  the  ground  he  rolled :  and 

Odysseus 
Molion  slew,  his  charioteer  and  valiant  attendant. 
These,  their  career  of  war  cut  short,  to  the  birds  they  relinquished ; 
Carrying  dismay  and  confusion  then  plunged  in  the  thick  of  the  Trojans, 
Like  two  boars  which  savagely  turn  on  the  dogs  that  pursue  them. 
Turning  thus,  they  raged  through  the  ranks  of  the  foe,  and  the  Grecians 
Breathed,  and  a  respite  enjoyed  in  their  flight  from  the  terrors  of  Hector. 
Next  on  a  chariot  they  came  which  the  noblest  warriors  of  Troia 
Bore;  two  sons  of  Percosian  Merops;  best  among  augurs, 
Skilled  in  prophetic  lore.     He  had  warned  his  sons,  and  forbid  them 
Ever  to  mix  in  destructive  war.     In  vain:  for  their  valour      (331) 
Urged  them  to  disobey ;  and  death's  dark  spell  was  upon  them. 
Both  by  the  mighty  spear  of  Tydeus'  son,  Diomedes, 
Lifeless  were  stretched,  and  their  splendid  spoils  were  the  prize  of  the 

victor. 
Those  of  Hippodamus  brave  and  Hypeirochus  fell  to  Odysseus. 

Thus  war's  equal  strain  great  Zeus  on  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans 
Laid,  and  from  Ida's  height  he  viewed  them  destroying  each  other. 
Now  Diomedes  Agastrophus  smote  with  his  spear  on  the  hip-bone, 
Paeon's  heroic  son.     In  vain  he  fled,  for  his  chariot 
Stood  not  at  hand  his  escape  to  aid.     Despising  precaution, 
Far  in  the  rear  had  he  left  his  car  in  charge;  to  the  combat 
Marching  on  foot  in  the  foremost  ranks,  and  his  life  was  the  forfeit. 
Hector   observed,  as   he  darted  his  piercing  glance  through  the 

squadrons;

228  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XI. 

Shouting  he  rushed  to  the  spot  with  a  compact  mass  of  his  Trojans. 
Brave  as  he  was,  some  tremor  through  Diomede  ran,  and  Odysseus 
Near  him  perceiving,  thus  he  bespoke  his  friend  and  companion : 
"Rolling  upon  us  it  comes — this  ruin!     This  terrible  Hector! 
Now  stand  firm !    Here  keep  we  our  ground,  and,  awaiting,  repel  him." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  poising  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin 
Hurled  it  aloft.    It  missed  not  its  mark,  but  down  on  his  helmet  (350) 
Struck,  near  the  crest;  but  its  blunted  point  from  the  brass  of  the  helmet 
Glanced,  nor  his  fair  skin  pierced :  for  the  casque,  the  gift  of  Apollo, 
Threefold  and  peaked  in  form,  turned  off  the  brunt  of  the  weapon. 
Hector   retired,  and   far   in    the  distance  mixed  with  the  Trojans : 
Down  on  his  knee  then  dropped,  and  his  strong  hand  barely  supported, 
Pressed  on  the  ground,  his  weight;  and  his  sight  was  blotted  with 

darkness. 
Yet,  while  Tydeides  followed  his  glancing  spear  through  the  combat 
Far  in  the  press,  where  fixed  in  the  earth  it  stood,  and  regained  it, 
Hector  recovered  his  breath  and  arose;  then  sprang  to  his  chariot, 
Hurried  away,  and  was  lost  in  the  crowd,  escaping  destruction.   (360) 
Threat'ning  then  with  his  spear  thus  shouted  brave  Diomedes: 
"Dog!     Thou  hast  had  a  near  escape  from  death.     To  thy  rescue 
Phoebus  Apollo  has  come  once  more :  the  pow'r  thou  invokest 
Ever  when  danger  is  nigh  and  the  clash  of  spears  is  around  thee. 
But  should  we  meet  again,  that  hour  is  thy  last.     I  will  end  thee, 
If  but  one  friendly  pow'r  assist  the  arms  of  Tydeides. 
Fly  then  I  my  conqu'ring  spear  shall  find  some  other  employment." 

Thus  he  spake;  then  bent  over  Paeon's  son  to  despoil  him. 
This  Alexander  perceiving,  the  fair-haired  Helena's  husband, 
Where  at  the  tomb  of  that  ancient  chief  Dardanian  Ilus,  (370) 

Leaning  against  a  column  he  stood  concealed,  on  Tydeides 
Bent  with  deliberate  aim  his  bow.     While  the  hero  was  stripping 
From   the   dead   warrior's   bosom   the   corslet,  the    shield   from   his 

shoulders, 
And  from  his  head  the  pond'rous  casque,  he  strained  on  the  bowstring ; 
Shot;  (nor  in  vain  flew  the  shaft  from  the  firaclised  hand  of  the  archer ;) 
And  his  right  foot  transfixed.     Straight  through  went  the  arrow,  and 

nailed  it 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  229 

Fast  to  the  earth  beneath.     Then  merrily  laughed  Alexandros ; 
Forth  from  his  ambush  sprang,  and  exultingly  called  to  Tydeides : 
"Ha!   thou  art  hit.    Not  vain  hath  been  the  flight  of  my  arrow.    [380] 
Would  it  had  pierced  thy  heart  and  ta'en  thy  life;  that  the  Trojans  (380) 
Freely  might  breathe,  from  the  terror  relieved  with  which  they  behold 

thee 
Shudd'ring,  as  bleating  goats  behold  some  ravaging  lion." 

Then  Diomedes,  nought  dismayed,  this  answer  returned  him; 
"Archer!  reviler!  curl-bedecked,  seducer  of  maidens! 
Hand  against  hand  would'st  thou  try  thy  strength,  and  meet  me  in 

armour, 
Little  thy  twanging  bow  should  avail,  or  thy  bundle  of  arrows. 
Grand   is   thy  triumph,  forsooth  I    to  have  grazed  my  foot  with  thy 

weapon, 
Which  I  no  more  regard  than  a  woman's  scratch,  or  an  infant's. 
Light  is  the  dart  that  flies  from  a  hand  so  feeble  and  worthless.    [390] 
Not  so  where  mine  alights.    Its  touch  is  death,  and  the  message  (390) 
Piercing  and  sharp  which  it  bears.     What  foe  soever  receives  it, 
Furrowed   with   tears  are  his  widow's  cheeks,   and  his  children  are 

orphans. 
There,    where   the   crimsoned   plain   proclaims   the   fate   which   has 

reached  him, 
Outcast  and  rotting  he  lies:  more  birds  than  women  around  him."  [395] 
Thus,  indignant,  he  spake:  but  Odysseus  quickly  approaching  (395) 
Took  up  his  ground  in  front  to  protecl  his  friend,  who  behind  him 
Seated,  and  bending  him  down,  released  his  foot,  and  the  arrow 
Tore   from   the  wound,  and  dire  was  the  pang  that  ensued  as  he 

wrenched  it. 
So  to  his  car  he  sprang,   and  the  charioteer  he  commanded 
Swiftly  to  drive  to  the  hollow  ships;  for  his  soul  was  in  torment.  (400) 
Now  was  Odysseus  abandoned.     No  Greek  remained  to  support 

him, 
Fear  had  dispersed  them  all,  and  the  Trojans  were  closing  upon  him. 
Inly  disturbed,  he  spake,  with  his  own  brave  spirit  communing : 
"Sore  indeed  am  I  now  bested.     To  fly  were  disgraceful, 
Scared  by  a  crowd.     To  be  set  on  alone  were  a  desperate  hazard, 


23o  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XL 

Now  that  the  Greeks  with  fear  by  Zeus  inspired,  have  retreated. 
Yet  what  need  of  debate?   What  room  for  doubt  or  for  question? 
This  I  know,  that  none  but  a  coward  retires  from  a  battle. 
Whoso  will  shew  himself  brave  must  maintain  his  post,  and  unshrinking 
Stand  to  the  last,  regardless  of  death  received  or  inflicted."    (410) 

Thus  while  he  stood,  collecli7ig  his  stre?igth  and  inly  debating, 
Closing  upon  him  on  all  sides  thronged  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
Circling  him  in,  and  enclosing  their  own  destruction  amidst  them. 
As  when  the  dogs,  cheered  on  by  youthful  and  vigorous  hunters, 
Close  round  a  bristly  boar  roused  up  from  the  depth  of  the  thicket; 
Sharp'ning  his  tusks  in  his  crooked  jaws  he  stands  and  defies  them. 
Round  him  they  crowd,  and  a  snapping  of  teeth  is  heard,  but  the 

boldest 
Holds  aloof  and  awaits  the  rush  of  the  terrible  savage. 
Thus  round  Odysseus,  belov'd  of  Zeus,  were  gathered  the  Trojans. 
On  he  rushed,  and  first  on  the  blameless  Dei'opites  (420) 

Springing,  he  drove  his  spear  o'er  the  rim  of  his  shield  through  his 

shoulder : 
Thoon  then  met  his  fate,  then  valiant  Ennomus  perished. 
Then  Chersidamas.     Him  he  smote  as  he  leaped  from  his  chariot. 
Under  his  bossy   shield   through   the   navel   he   pierced   him;   and 

prostrate 
Clutching  the  dust  in  his  hollow  grasp  he  fell  and  expired. 

These  neglecting,  Charops  next  he  pierced  with  his  jav'lin, 
Hippasus'  son;  of  nolle  birth:  own  brother  to  Socus. 
Socus  of  godlike  feature  and  form,  who  ran  to  protect  him, 
All  too  late !    Coming  close  to  Odysseus  thus  he  bespake  him  : 
"Noble  Odysseus!  famed  alike  for  cunning  and  valour,  (43°) 

One  and  another  of  Hippasus'  sons  this  day  must  thou  conquer; 
Two  such  heroes  as  him  thou  hast  slain,  must  despoil  of  their  armour, 
Or  by  my  spear  subdued,  thyself  must  yield  to  destruction." 
Ending,  his  spear  he  hurled  at  the  smooth  round  shield  of  Odysseus, 
Thoro'  the  shining  orb  it  forced  its  impetuous  passage, 
Then  through  the  corslet  rich  its  course  pursued,  and  descending, 
All  the  skin  from  his  side  tore  off;   but  Pallas  Athene 
Turned  its  point,  and  suffered  it  not  to  pierce  to  his  entrails. 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  231 

This  when  Odysseus  felt,  his  wound  not  mortal  perceiving, 

Back   some  steps   he   recoiled,  and  frowning   on    Socus,    addressed 

him :  (440) 

"Wretch!  thine  hour  is  at  hand,  and  swift  destruction  awaits  thee. 
What  though  perchance  this  day  I   shall   fight   no   more   with   the 

Trojans, 
Yet,  be  assured,  thy  doom  is  sealed.    Black  death  on  thy  footsteps 
Follows,  pursuing  thee  dose.    By  this  lance  shalt  thou  perish,  securing 
Triumph  for  me;  for  thyself  the  downward  path  unto  Hades." 

Thus  he  spake :  and  Socus  had  now  no  thought  but  of  safety, 
But  as  he  turned  him  to  flight,  the  spear  through  his  back  found  a 

passage, 
Ent'ring  between  his  shoulders,  and  issuing  forth  at  his  bosom. 
Down  he  fell  with  a  crash.     Then  Odysseus  shouted  in  triumph: 
"Socus!   great   Hippasus'  son,  that  fierce  subduer  of  horses,     (450) 
Death  hath  cut  short  thy  career  and  made  an  end  of  thy  warfare. 
Wretch !   o'er  whom,  as  thou  liest,  no  mother  revered  and  no  father 
Bending,  shall  close  thy  dying  eyes,  but  ravenous  vultures 
Flapping  their  wings  obscene,  to  tear  thy  flesh  shall  assemble: 
While  over  me  shall  a  costly  tomb  be  raised  by  the  Grecians." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  first  from  his  flesh  the  jav'lin  of  Socus 
Drew,  and  its  shaft  disengaged  from  his  bossy  shield,  while  in  torrents 
Welled   from  the  wound  his  blood,  and  bitter  and  sharp  were  his 

torments. 
Forthwith  the  Troian  host,  when  they  saw  the  blood  of  Odysseus, 
One  encouraged  another,  and  closed  in  crowds  round  the  hero.  (460) 
Back  some  steps  he  retreated  and  called  for  aid  to  his  comrades. 
Thrice  did  he  shout  amain,  with  a  mighty  shout,  which  to  utter 
Hardly  might  mortal  voice  suffice.     Thrice  heard  Menelaiis 
Where,  supported  by  Aias  he  kept  his  ground,  and  addressed  him: 
"Aias!  Telamon's  son!  Jove  nurtured!  chief  of  thy  nation! 
Heard 'st  thou  that  shout?     'Tis  Odysseus,  in  sore  distress  whom  the 

Trojans 
Doubtless  surround,  and  are  pressing  upon  him  alone  and  unaided, 
All  retreat  intercepting,  and  bearing  him  down  in  the  tumult. 
Up!   Let  us  pierce  the  throng  between,  and  fly  to  his  rescue. 


232  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XI. 

Grievous  it  were,  a  misfortune  to  Greece,  if  abandoned  and  help- 
less (470) 
One  so  brave  and  so  great  should  fall  by  the  hands  of  the  Trojans." 

Speaking  thus,  he  set  forth,  by  Aias  followed,  and  quickly 
Came,  where  Odysseus  they  found,  beloved  of  Zeus;  and  about  him 
Crowding  the  Troian  host:  like  tawny  jackals  surrounding 
Some  broad-antlered  stag  in  a  mountain  pass,  which  the  hunter 
Aiming  from  far  with  a  dart  has  struck.     He  turns  and  escapes  him, 
Flying,  so  long  as  his  blood  runs  warm  and  his  limbs  can  support  him. 
But  when  the  shaft  has  subdued  his  fainting  strength,  and  he  totters 
Feebly,  the  hungry  pack  flocks  eagerly  round  to  devour  him 
In  the    deep    thicket's    shade.     Then   chance   brings   a  lion   upon 
them  (480) 

Raging. — Away  they  fly,  and  the  prey  remains  to  the  stronger. 
Thus  round  Odysseus,  the  brave  and  the  sage,  were  gathered  the 

Trojans, 
Many  and  strong.    But  with  shield,  and  with  lance  protended,  the  hero 
Kept  them  at  bay  and  deferred  the  cruel  fate  he  expected. 
Up  came  Aias,  his  ample  shield  like  a  tower  advancing. 
Close  at  his  side  he  stood  and  the  Trojans  were  scattered  in  terror, 
While  Menelaiis  with  friendly  hand  the  hero  sustaining, 
Led  him  away  from  the  press,  and  awaited  his  chariot's  arrival. 
Aias  pursued  the  flying  rout ;  and  first  on  Dorycles 
Lighted  his  spear,  one  of  Priam's  sons :  then  Pandocus  followed,  (49c) 
Stretched   with   the   slain,    and   Lysander,  and  Pyrasus   brave,  and 

Pylartes. 
As  when  a  wintry  flood  comes  foaming  down  from  the  mountains 
Swoll'n   with   incessant  rain   by   Zeus   poured    down;    through    the 

meadows, 
Oaks  uprooted  and  pines  it  rolls  along,  and  resistless 
Hurries  them  on,  a  shattered  and  mingled  wreck,  to  the  ocean: 
Thus  swept  the  might  of  Aias  before  him  the  rout  of  the  Trojans, 
Slaying  both  horse  and  man.     But  the  sound  of  the  tumult  to  Hector 
Reached  not;  who  far  away  to  the  left  on  the  banks  of  Scamander 
Led  the  assault;  where  thickest  fell  the  heads  of  the  heroes, 
Where  the  tumultuous  roar  of  war  raged  loudest  and  fiercest,  (500) 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  233 

Where  round  Idomeneus  bold  and  Nestor  the  Greeks  were  collected. 
Mixed  up  with  these  great  Hector  fought,  and  wonders  accomplished; 
Car-borne,  he  dashed  with  his  mighty  spear  through  the  ranks  of  their 

warriors, 
Wasting  the  flow'r  of  their  youth.     Yet  not  for  this  had  they  yielded, 
But  that  the  youthful  archer,  the  fair-haired  Helena's  husband, 
Aiming  a  three-barbed  shaft  from  his  bow  at  the  valiant  Machaon, 
Pierced  his  right  shoulder  through,  and  his  deeds  of  prowess  arrested. 
Shuddered  the  Greeks,  though  their  bosoms  with  high-wrought  courage 

were  panting, 
Dreading  the  loss  of  one  so  prized,  should  the  fight  go  against  them. 
Then  did  Idomeneus  thus  exhort  Gerenian  Nestor:  (5!°) 

"Nestor!  Neleus'  son,  thou  pride  and  boast  of  the  Grecians! 
Quick!   my  chariot  ascend,  and  place  Machaon  beside  thee. 
Carry  him  off  to  the  ships  at  the  utmost  speed  of  thy  horses. 
More  than  a  host  of  men  is  a  sage  physician  among  us, 
Skilled  to  extract  the  barbed  dart,  and  cure  us  with  ointments." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  Nestor  prepared  at  once  to  obey  him, 
Up  on  his  car  he  sprang;  and  forthwith  mounted  beside  him 
Great  Machaon,  that  noble  physician,  Asclepias'  offspring. 
Sounded  the  clanging  lash,  and  the  horses  flew,  unreluctant, 
Skimming  the  plain  to  the  hollow  ships,  as  longing  to  reach  them.  (520) 

Sitting  beside  great  Hector,  Cebriones  saw  that  confusion 
Reigned,  afar,  in  the  Trojan  ranks,  and  called  his  attention: 
"Hector!   Here,  on  the  skirts  of  the  fight,  mixed  up  with  the  Grecians 
Waste  we  our  time;  while  all  is  at  stake  elsewhere,  and  the  Trojans 
There,  on  the  right,  man  and  horse,  in  wild  confusion  are  driven. 
Great  Telamonian  Aias  is  routing  them.     Well  do  I  know  him 
By  the  broad  shield  he  bears,  on  his  shoulder  braced.     Let  us  hasten 
Thither,  where  horseman  and  foot  intermixed  in  utter  confusion, 
Slaughter  each  other  at  random,  and  wildest  rages  the  uproar. 
Thither  direct  we  our  steeds  and  car.    There  most  thou  art  needed."  (530) 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  fair-maned  steeds  at  once  he  excited 
With  the  sharp-clanging  thong;   and  they  felt  the  stroke,  and  they 

bounded, 
Hurrying  along  the  car  through  the  thick  of  the  Trojans  and  Argives; 


234  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XI. 

Trampling  on  shields  and  spurning  the  dead.  With  blood  was  the  axle 
Dripping  beneath,  distained;  and  the  beauteous  rim  of  the  chariot 
Spattered  with  drops,  dashed  up  from  the  stamping  hoofs  of  the  horses, 
And  from  the  tires  of  the  whirling  wheels.  Thus  onward  he  hurried, 
Eager  to  pierce  the  fighting  throng,  and  to  slay.  'JMong  the  Grecians 
Terror  he  scattered,  and  rout;  nor  spared  he  his  spear  in  the  struggle. 
Rushing  amain,  with  sword,  with  spear,  and  with  ponderous  frag- 
ments (54°) 
Torn  from  the  plain,  through  the  vulgar  crowd  he  broke  and  dispersed 

them. 
Aias  however,  himself,  great  Telamon's  son,  he  avoided. 

Zeus  howbeit,  from  his  throne  on  high,  struck  Aias  with  panic. 
Standing  amazed,  behind  him  he  cast  his  seven-fold  buckler 
Bent  on  retreat,  and  eyeing,  like  some  wild  beast,  his  pursuers. 
Often  he  turned  him,  foot  behind  foot  reluctantly  dragging. 
As  when  the  dogs  and  rustics  rude,  round  the  stalls  of  their  oxen 
Keeping  their  nightly  watch,  drive  off  some  furious  lion, 
Suffering  not  their  fatted  kine  to  be  seized  by  the  savage; 
Rav'nous  for  food  with  repeated  assaults  he  rushes  upon  them,    (550) 
Eagerly  longing  to  tear  their  flesh:  in  vain;  for  their  jav'lins 
Darted  by  strong  and  daring  hands  come  thick,  and  the  faggots 
Blazing  are  tossed,  which  he    dreads,  in   the  height  of  his  rage   to 

encounter. 
Baffled  and  growling,  at  early  dawn  his  attempt  he  abandons. 
Aias  thus  drew  back  and  relinquished  the  field  to  the  Trojans 
Sorely  against  his  will,  for  he  feared  for  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
As  when  a  stubborn  ass,  in  despite  of  the  boys  to  a  cornfield 
Making  his  way  (on  his  sides  though  many  a  stick  has  been  broken), 
Browses  the  standing  crop;  the  boys  though  feeble  beset  him,     (559) 
Batt'ring  his  hide  with  resounding  blows;  till  roused  to  exertion 
(After  a  plenteous  meal),  at  length  he  quits  the  enclosure. 
Thus  did  the  Trojans  bold  and  the  hosts  far  summoned  to  aid  them 
Harass  the  slow  retreat  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias, 
Bristling  with  darts  and  spears  the  broad  expanse  of  his  buckler. 
Oft  did  he  halt  and  indignant  turn,  recollecting  his  valour, 
Facing  about  on  his  foes,  and  charging  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans; 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  235 

Then,  as  despairing  of  conquest,  resumed  his  retreat,  but  impeding 
Still  the  Trojans'  advance  on  the  Grecian  ships;  interposing 
Still  his  unconquered  strength  to  repress  the  rush  of  the  victors. 
Show'ring    around    him    the    spears    fell    thick,    by   the   hands    of 

assailants  (57°) 

Num'rous  and  strong  dispatched.     Some  reached,  but  pierced  not,  his 

buckler; 
More,  falling  short,  midway  in  the  ground  stood  fixed,  disappointed, 
Thirsting  for  blood,  and  longing  to  tear  the  flesh  of  a  foeman. 
Him  by  such  whelming  odds  opprest,  when  the  son  of  Evaemon, 
Noble  Eurypylus,  saw,  and  the  darts  fast  falling  around  him, 
Forward  he  rushed  and  beside  him  stood :  then,  aiming  his  jav'lin, 
Phausias'  son,  Apisaon,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Struck  through  the  liver  beneath  his  waist,  cutting  short  his  existence. 
On   the  conqueror   sprang,  and   was    stripping   the   arms   from   his 

shoulders  ; 
Him  Alexander  perceived,  the  godlike  in  form  and  in  feature,      (580) 
Stooping,  unguarded,  exposed,  fit  mark  for  the  shaft  of  an  archer. 
Taking  his  aim,  his  bow  he  drew,  and  Eurypylus  wounded 
In  the  right  thigh.    The  shaft  broke  short,  and  severe  was  the  torment. 
Back  to  his  comrades  retreating  at  once,  his  fate  he  avoided. 
Shouting  amain  as  he  went,  and  thus  exhorted  the  Grecians  : 
"Friends  and  heroes  of  Greece!     Her  leaders  in  war  and  in  council! 
Rally  and  make  a  stand,  and  save,  if  you  can,  from  destruction 
Aias,  who  fights  o'erwhelmed  with  spears ;  and,  by  numbers  surrounded, 
Hardly,  methinks,  will  escape.    Up!  Greeks,  and  rescue  your  comrade. 
Stand  round  the  mighty  Aias,  the  great  Telamonian  hero."      (590) 
Thus  exhorted  the  wounded  Eurypylus.    All,  when  they  heard  him, 
Turned  them  from  flight  and  formed  in  line;  their  shields  to  their 

shoulders 
Slanted,  their  spears  advanced.    At  length  came  Aias  and  joined  them, 
Joyfully  falling  in  with  the  ranks  of  his  friends  and  companions. 
Then,  like  a  fire  fresh  fed  and  rekindled,  blazed  forth  the  battle. 

Now  to  the  ships  upon  Nestor's  car,  the  Neleian  horses 
Panting  had  borne  Machaon,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  nation. 
These  from  the  prow  of  his  lofty  ship  the  godlike  Achilles 


236 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XI. 


Coming  beheld,  as  he  gazed  o'er  the  plain  and  witnessed  the  combat ; 
Followed  the  turns  of  the  fight, and  enjoyed  the  rout  of  the  Grecians:  (600) 
Then  from  the  ship  to  Patroclus  called,  his  friend  and  companion, 
Who  in  his  tent  perceived  and  obeyed  the  summons,  and  stepped  forth 
Glorious  as  Mars.     That  step  was  for  him  the  beginning  of  mischief. 
Thus  then,  advancing,  enquired  the  valiant  son  of  Meneetius: 
"Why  doth  Achilles  call?     What  need  hath  his  friend  of  Patroclus?" 

Thus  in  his  turn  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"Friend  most  dear  to  my  heart!     Illustrious  son  of  Meneetius! 
Soon,  methinks,  shall  I  see  at  my  feet  these  Greeks,  for  assistance 
Begging,  o?i  bended  knees:  so  sore  the  distress  that  o'erwhelms  them. 
Now,  however,  Patroclus,  beloved  of  Zeus!  unto  Nestor  (610) 

Haste,  and  enquire  what  wounded  chief  he  brings  from  the  battle; 
Like  Machaon  he  seemed,  Asclepias'  son,  as  he  passed  me, 
Seen  from  behind :  his  form  the  same;  but  I  saw  not  his  features  : 
All  too  fast  was  he  hurried  along  by  the  speed  of  the  horses." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  Patroclus,  obeying  the  words  of  his  comrade, 
Wended  his  way  in  haste  to  the  tents  and  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
They  meanwhile  had  reached  the  tent  of  Nelei'an  Nestor, 
And  when  at  length  from  their  car  on  the  fertile  earth  they  alighted, 
Then  from  the  yoke  Eurymedon,  Nestor's  faithful  attendant,  (619) 
Loosed  the  steeds.     And  the  chiefs  on  the  breezy  shore  of  the  ocean, 
Facing  the  cooling  wind,  dried  off  the  sweat  from  their  garments ; 
Then,  to  the  tent  retiring,  they  took  their  seats  on  the  couches. 
Fair  Hecamede  prepared  a  refreshing  draught:  (Hecamede, 
Daughter  of  great  Arsinous,  Tenedos'  Prince,  by  Achilles 
Captured;  for  Nestor  chos'n  from  the  spoil  by  acclaim  of  the  Grecians, 
Hon'ring  the  man  amongst  them  in  years  unmatched  and  in  wisdom). 
She,  having  placed  before  them  a  polished  and  beautiful  table 
Resting  on  claws  of  dark-blue  steel,  set  a  basket  upon  it 
Formed  of  refulgent  bronze,  with  abundant  bread,  and  beside  it, 
Onions  (a  relish  for  drink),  and  the  yellow  neclar  of  honey.    (630) 
Near  them,  a  gorgeous  cup  by  the  king  brought  thither  from  Pylos, 
Knosps  of  gold  adorned  it  on  all  sides;  four  were  its  handles, 
Each  of  two  feeding  doves  the  forms  supporting,  and  modelled 
All  of  the  purest  gold :  two  hollow  bases  sustained  it. 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  237 

Not  without  effort  another  might  lift  its  weight  from  the  table 
Filled  to  the  brim  with  wine;  though  Nestor  easily  raised  it. 
This,  on  the  table  duly  placed,  their  beauteous  attendant 
Filled   with    Pramnian   wine,   spreading  goat's-milk  cheese   o'er  the 

surface, 
Strewn  from  a  grater  of  bronze,  and  with  white  meal  sprinkled  the 

posset. 
All  prepared,  the  wearied  chiefs  to  drink  she  invited.  (640) 

They,  when  at  length  their  burning  thirst  was  allayed,  sate  talking 
One  to  another,  cheering  their  hearts  with  sociable  converse. 
Just  then  approaching,  divine  Patroclus  appeared  at  the  doorway; 
Him  beholding  sprang  from  his  seat  Gerenian  Nestor, 
Grasped  his  hand  and  led  him  within,  and  pressed  to  be  seated. 
This  Patroclus  declined,  and  thus  excused  his  refusal: 
"Noble  old  friend!  persuade  me  not  to  sit  or  to  linger, 
Dread,  and  impatient  of  all  delay  is  he  who  hath  sent  me 
Hither,  to  ask  what  wounded  chief  thou  hast  saved.     But  I  know  it 
Now;  for  Machaon  I  see,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people.   (650) 
Therefore  at  once  I  return,  aud  my  answer  bear  to  Achilles. 
Well  thou  know'st,  illustrious  sage !  the  man,  and  his  temper, 
Fiery,  imputing  blame  where  its  very  semblance  exists  not." 

Nestor  then,  the  Gerenian  knight,  thus  sadly  responded: 
"  What!    Can  Achilles  thus  then  pity  the  sons  of  Achaia 
Whom  he  beholds  with  wounds  opprest?     The  distress  of  our  army 
Little  indeed  he  knows :  how  many,  our  best  and  our  bravest, 
Stricken  with  darts  and  spears  in  the  ships  lie  wounded  a?id groaning ! 
Brave  Diomedes,  Tydeus'  son,  lies  pierced  with  an  arrow; 
Spear-struck,  Odysseus  and  great  Agamemnon's  self  are  disabled ;  (660) 
Valiant  Eurypylus  bears  in  his  thigh  the  shaft  of  the  Trojan; 
He  whom  thou  seest,  whom  but  now  I  snatched  from  the  thick  of 

the  battle, 
From  the  same  bowstring  another  bears  :  while  heartless  Achilles, 
Wrapped  in   his    own   proud  might,    nor   regards   the    Greeks   nor 

protects  them. 
Will   he   then  wait   till   our  ships,  in  the  Greeks'  despite,  at  their 

moorings

[Book  XI. 


Blaze  with  the  Trojan  flames,  and  till  we  ourselves,  overpowered, 
Perish  one  after  another  ?     Alas !  that  my  strength  is  decaying : 
Not  such  as  once  sustained  these  active  and  vigorous  members  ! 
Would   I  were   young   once  more — that  again  such  force  I  could 

summon, 
As  when  that  strife  arose  'twixt  the  warriors  of  Elis  and  Pylos      (670) 
Touching  our  oxen  driv'n;  when  I,  in  my  turn,  in  reprisal 
Drove  their  herds,  and  their  leader,  the  valiant  Itymoneas, 
Son  of  Hypeirochus,  slew,  who  in  Elis  dwelt,  and  his  oxen 
Fighting  to  save,  lay  stretched  at  my  feet  by  a  stroke  of  my  javlin ; 
Routed,  on  every  side  we  scattered  his  army  of  rustics. 
Rich  was  the  spoil  and  abundant  the  prey  we   swept   from   their 

country, 
Fifty  droves  of  oxen,  as  many  of  sheep  were  our  booty, 
Fifty  great  herds  of  swine  and  of  bleating  goats  :  in  addition 
Thrice  that  number  of  bright-bay  steeds  we  seized  in  their  pastures, 
All  of  them   mares,  and  many  had  young  foals  suckling  beneath 

them.  (680) 

All  we  drove  to  Neleian  Pylos,  all  in  the  city 
Lodged,  ere  the  close  of  night :  and  much  was  my  father  delighted 
Young  as  I  was  to  see  me  return  enriched  and  triumphant. 
But  when  the  dawn  appeared,  we  sent  forth  heralds,  to  summon 
All  to  attend  and  stand  forth  to  whom  debts  were  owing  in  Elis. 
Then  did  our  Pylian  chiefs  assemble,  and  make  the  division 
Fairly :  for  many  and  great  were  th'  Epeans'  debts  to  our  people. 
Few  at  that  time  were  the  Pylians  ;  much  depressed  in  their  fortunes ; 
Since  that  in  by-gone  days  the  destroying  might  of  Heracles 
Wasted   our   city's   strength,    and    slaughtered    our    best    and    our 

bravest.  (690) 

Twelve  were  the  sons  of  Neleus,  a  blameless  race.    But  amongst  them 
I  was  the  sole  survivor.     The  rest  had  bled  for  their  country. 
So,  der  our  low  estate  exulting,  the  buskined  Epeans 
Many  a  wrong  inflicted,  and  wrought  full  many  an  outrage. 
Neleus  a  drove  of  oxen  and  flock  of  sheep  had  selected, 
Setting  three  hundred,  the  best,  apart  for  himself,  with  their  shepherds. 
This  for  a  mighty  debt  he  seized  in  payment  from  Elis.

Horses  four  had  he  sent  with  chariots,  ever  victorious, 
There  to  contend  in  the  race.     The  prize  proposed  was  a  tripod. 
These  did  Augeas,  king  of  men,  then  reigning  in  Elis,  (7°°) 

Seize,  and  their  charioteers  dismiss,  much  grieved  and  indignant. 
Wroth  at  the  tale  they  told  and  the  outrage,  thus  did  my  father 
Take  satisfaction  ample  and  full;  and  the  rest  to  his  people 
Left  to  divide  for  themselves,  that  none  might  complain  of  injustice. 
This  when  accomplished,  all  through  the  town  was  sacrifice  offered 
To  the  immortal  Gods.     On  the  third  day  down  came  th'  Epeans 
All  together,  in  battle  array,  on  foot  and  in  chariots  : 
Both  the  Moliones  then  for  the  first  time  braced  on  their  armour, 
Amor's  youthful  sons,  unskilled  in  war  and  its  hardships. 

"High  on  a  lofty  crag  the  far  Alphaeus  o'erlooking  (7IQ) 

Stands  Thryoessa,  the  out-most  town  on  our  Pylian  frontier; 
This  they  beleaguer'd,  eagerly  longing  to  take  and  destroy  it. 
All   the  wide   plain   had   they  crossed,  and  approached  the  town, 

when  Athene 
Down  from  Olympus  came  by  night  and  bade  us  assemble 
Armed,  for  its  rescue.     On  willing  ears  of  the  Pylian  nation 
Fell    the    command.      All    burned   for   the   fight :    but   my   father 

forbade  me 
Then  to  go  forth  in  arms,  and  concealed  my  steeds  and  my  chariot. 
Thinking  me  still  too  young,  unversed  in  the  practice  of  warfare. 
Thither  however  on  foot  I  marched  with  the  cars  and  the  horsemen 
Mingling,  not  undistinguish'd,  for  Pallas  led  me  to  glory.         (720) 

"Where  Minyaeia's  stream  flows  down  to  the  ocean,  and  joins  it 
Close  to  Arene,  halted  our  chariots,  and  waited  for  daybreak, 
While  from  all  sides  kept  pouring  in  the  hosts  of  our  footmen. 
Thence  setting  forth  in  complete  array,  all  glittering  in  armour 
Marched  we,  and  reached  by  noon  the  sacred  stream  of  Alphaeus. 
There  to  almighty  Zeus  our  holiest  offerings  we  rendered; 
Sacrificed  then  to  Alphaeus  a  bull,  a  bull  to  Poseidon, 
And,  from  the  herd,  unyoked,  to  the  blue-eyed  goddess  a  heifer. 
Troop  by  troop  where  we  stood,  we  consumed  our  ev'ning  provision. 
Each  man  then  lay  down  in  his  arms,  and  slept  till  the  morning,  (730) 
Stretched  on  the  river's  bank.     Meanwhile  the  valiant  Epeans 


240 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XI. 


Formed  in  array,  with  elated  hopes,  the  city  beleaguered. 
Vainly !  then  first  they  saw  what  a  work  of  war  'was  before  them. 
For,  when  the  sun's  first  beams  illumined  the  earth  with  their  splendour 
Battle  we  joined ;  to  Zeus  our  prayers  addressing,  and  Pallas. 
Foremost  of  all  in  that  fight  between  the  Epeans  and  Pylians 
Mulius,  a  spearman  skilled,  I  slew,  and  seized  on  his  horses. 
(Mulius,  to  whom  Augeas  the  king  had  united  in  wedlock 
Golden-hair'd  Agamede  his  eldest  child,  who  the  virtues 
Knew   of  each   healing   plant  which  the   wide    Earth   yields  in  its 

bounty).  (7  40) 

On  he  rushed  in  his  might,  but  soon  in  the  dust  had  I  stretched  him, 
Pierced  by  my  brazen  spear.     Then  at  once  I  sprang  to  his  chariot, 
Taking  my  place  in  our  foremost  line.     With  dismay  the  Epeans 
Witnessed  their  noblest  hero's  fall,  the  best  of  their  horsemen, 
Bravest  of  all  their  chiefs  :  and  they  broke,  and  scattered  on  all  sides. 
Then  in  pursuit,  der  the  plain  I  swept  like  a  blackening  whirlwind. 
Fifty  chariots  I  took,  from  each  two  warriors  hurling. 
Biting  the  ground  with  their  teeth  they  fell  by  my  conquering  jav'lin. 
Then  had  I  slain  the  Moliones  twain,  the  offspring  of  Actor, 
But  that  the  dread  earth-shaking  Father,  the  mighty  Poseidon,  (750) 
Saved  them,  in  mist  involved,  and  snatched  them  away  from  the 

combat. 
Then  did  almighty  Zeus  give  valour  and  might  to  the  Pylians. 
All  through  that  vast  and  wide-outstretching  plain  we  pursued  them, 
Slaught'ring  their  flying  host,  and  loading  ourselves  with  their  trophies. 
Far  as  Buprasium's  fertile  fields  we  pushed  on  our  horses  : 
Far  as  the  Olenian  crag,  and  the  gentle  slope,  as  Aleisium 
Known.      There    at    length   we    stopped :   for    Athena  recalled  us 

from  conquest. 
'Twas  by  my  hand  their  last  man  fell.     Then  back  the  Achaians 
Drove  their  triumphant  cars  from  Buprasium's  pastures  to  Pylos. 
Loud   rose   the   praises   of  Zeus   among   Gods,    among  mortals   of 

Nestor.  (760) 

Such  was  I,  long,  long  since,  among  men  of  renown.     But  Achilles, 
Proudly  conscious  of  might  unused,  will  deeply  repent  him, 
Bitterly  mourn  in  tears  when  unaided  the  Greeks  shall  have  perished. 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  241 


Ah !  my  friend  !     How  well  I  remember  Menoetius'  counsels 
Spoken  that  day  when  from  Phthia  he  sent  thee  to  join  Agamemnon  •' 
Both  of  us,  present  as  guests,  myself  and  noble  Odysseus, 
Heard  each  word  that  at  parting  he  spake  in  the  palace  of  Peleus. 
Thither  we  came  when  through  Greece  we  passed,  collecting  her  armies, 
And  to  his  royal  halls  repaired  to  deliver  our  mission. 
There  that  glorious  hero  we  found,  thy  father  Menoetius,  (770) 

There  thyself  and  Achilles.     That  ancient  warrior,  Peleus, 
Burned  unto  thundering  Zeus  a  bull's  fat  thighs  in  the  court-yard 
Open  to  heart  n.     There  stood  he,  a  golden   goblet  upraising 
Pouring  the  dark  red  wine  on  the  blazing  fires  of  the  altar. 
There  were  ye  both  in  attendance,  dividing  the  flesh.    In  the  gate-way 
Rertrent  we  stood.     In  glad  surprise  sprang  forward  Achilles 
Grasped  our  hands,  and  brought  us  within,  and  bade  us  be  seated, 
Welcome  affording,  and  all  that  pertains  to  friendly  reception. 
Hunger  and  thirst  appeased,  I  entered  at  once  on  our  mission, 
Claiming    your   aid,    and    exhorting    you   both    to    march   with    our 
armies.  (780) 

Joyfully  both  agreed.     Much  sage  advice  did  your  parents 
Give  you.     The  rev'rend  Peleus  simply  exhorted  Achilles 
Aye  to  be  brave,  and  to  take  the  lead  in  the  ranks  of  the  foremost. 
But  unto  thee  was  this  weighty  and  solemn  advice  by  thy  father 
Spoken.     My  son  !  Achilles  by  birth  is  far  thy  superior : 
Yet  art  thou  more  mature  in  years.     He  excels  thee  in  valour, 
Yet  may'st  thou  oft  with  wise  and  prudent  counsel  direct  him, 
Point  out  the  path  of  right,  and  lead  him  by  virtuous  example. 
Such  were  the  old  man's  words :  forgotten  alas !     But  occasion 
Urges.    Yet  may'st  thou  speak  the  word,  and  yet  may  he  listen.  (790) 
Who  shall  say,  if  some  God  assist,  how  far  thou  mayst  move  him  ? 
Welcome  are  even  a  friend's  reproofs :  thrice  welcome  his  precepts. 
But  if  some  oracle  dwell  on  his  mind,  of  terrible  import, 
Something  by  Zeus  decreed  which  his  Goddess  mother  hath  told  him, 
Then  go  thou  in  his  place :  let  him  send  thee  forth  with  his  people, 
All  the  brave  Myrmidon  host,  to  give  light  and  hope  to  the  Grecians ; 
Let  him  too  lend  thee  his  own  bright  arms  to  shine  forth  in  the  battle 
Like  to  himself,  and  the  Trojans  deceived  will  shrink  from  your  onset,

Giving  a  breathing  time  to  the  martial  sons  of  Achaia, 
Wearied  and  overborne,  how  short  soever  the  respite.  (800) 

Fresh  as  ye  are,  with  ease  shall  ye  drive  from  our  ships  and  our  vessels 
Back  to  their  town  a  host  already  exhausted  with  fighting." 

Thus  the  sage  :  and  Patroclus'  heart  was  stirred  in  his  bosom. 
Forth  he  sped  on  his  way  through  the  ships,  to  return  to  Achilles. 
But  when  he  came  to  Odysseus'  ships,  where  the  place  of  assembly 
Lay,  and  the  judgment-seat  was  erected ;  where  to  th'  immortals 
Altars  were  raised  and  establish'd  rites  performed  by  the  Princes, 
There  he  encountered  Eurypylus,  high-born  son  of  Evaamon 
Wounded,  and  painfully  dragging  with  limping  gait  from  the  battle, 
Fixed   in   his   thigh,  the   shaft:   while  fast  from  his  head  and  his 
shoulders  (8l°) 

Ran  down  his  back  the  sweat.     Dark  blood  from  his  wound  forth 

trickling 
Marked  his  steps.     But  his  mind  was  firm  a?id  his  spirit  unconquered. 
Pity  and  grief  o'ercame  the  valiant  son  of  Mencetius, 
Seeing  his  friend  in  evil  plight,  and  thus  he  addressed  him : 

"And  is  it  come  to  this?     Ye  hapless  chiefs  of  Achaia! 
Thus  are  ye  destined,  far  away  from  your  friends  and  your  country 
Falling,  to  glut  with  your  fat  the  rav'ning  dogs  of  the  Trojans? 
Tell  me,  Eurypylus,  now,  Jove-nurtured,  tell  me  I  pray  thee, 
Still  do  our  Greeks  resist  th'  o'erwhelming  prowess  of  Hector? 
Or  do  they  shrink,  consumed  beneath  his  withering  jav'lin?"  (820) 

Thus  then  Eurypylus,  heav'n-inspired,  replied  to  the  question: 
"Jove-descended  Patroclus!  No  hope  remains  for  the  Grecians, 
Help  there  is  none.     On  their  ships  they  must   soon   fall   back   in 

confusion. 
There  already,  by  spears  and  by  darts  disabled,  their  leaders, 
All  the  noblest  and  best  of  our  host,  lie  wounded  and  bleeding, 
Under  the  Trojan  attack,  whose  force  each  moment  increases. 
But  do  thou,  O  my  friend !    to  my  ship  support,  and  assist  me. 
Cut  out  this  barb  from  my  thigh,  and  with  warm  and  soothing  ablution 
Cleanse  the  black  blood  from  my  wound ;  those  healing  simples  applying, 
Which   from  Achilles,   so  fame   reports,  thou   hast   learned  to   dis- 
tinguish, (830) 


Book  XL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  243 

Taught  him  by  Cheiron  himself,  the  wisest  and  best  of  the  Centaurs. 
Both  our  physicians,  Machaon  and  Podalirius,  are  absent. 
One,  I  believe,  in  his  tent  hard  by  lies  grievously  wounded, 
Needing,  himself,  a  wise  physician's  aid;    and  the  other 
Still  presents  in  the  field  an  unflinching  front  to  the  Trojans." 
Thus  to  his  friend  responded  the  valiant  son  of  Mencetius  : 
"  How  will  this  end  ?     My  brave  Eurypylus  !     How  can  I  aid  thee  ? 
Hence  must  I  speed  in  haste,  a  message  to  bear  to  Achilles, 
Sent  by  Xestor  himself,  the  guardian  and  stay  of  the  Grecians ; 
Yet  can  I  not  desert  thee  and  leave  thee  here  in  thine  anguish !"  (840) 
Thus  he  spake,  and  around  his  waist  embraced  and  upraised  him, 
Bearing  him  into  his  tent.     There  hides  were  spread  by  the  sen-ants, 
Where  having  laid  him,  Patroclus  extracted  the  barb  of  the  arrow, 
Skilfully  using  his  knife ;  and  with  warm  and  soothing  ablution, 
Washed  the  black  blood  from  the  wound.     Then  a  styptic  root  he 

selected, 
Sovereign  all  pain  to  assuage,  which  he  crushed  with  his  hands  and 

applied  it  : 
Instant  the  bleeding  wound  closed  up,  and  the  anguish  abated.

Argument. 


Digression,  descriptive  of  the  ultimate  destruction  of  the  Greek 
fortificatio?is  at  a  subsequent  period.  The  Trojans  adva?tce,  with  Heclor 
at  their  head,  in  pursuit  of  the  Greeks,  to  the  edge  of  the  tre7ichj  where 
by  the  advice  of  Polydamas  they  leave  their  chariots  and  divide  into  five 
attacking  parties.  Asius  however  retains  his  chariot  and  attacks  the  gate 
defended  by  the  Lapithce.  At  sight  of  an  omen,  Polydamas  advises  Heclor 
to  retreat.-  He  rejecls  the  advice,  passes  the  trench  {under  cover  of  a  dust 
storm)  and  pushes  on  to  the  wall.  Sarpedon  and  Glaucus  attempt  to 
scale  it.  Glaucus  is  wounded  by  Teucer.  Heclor  meanwhile  arrives 
opposite  the  gate,  which  he  bursts  open  by  the  blow  of  a  huge  stone  and 
rushes  in  followed  through  the  gate  and  over  the  wall  by  the  whole  Trojan 
army,  who  ptirstte  the  Greeks  to  their  ships. 


ILIAD.     BOOK   XII. 


HPHUS  in  the  tents  was  detained  the  valiant  son  of  Menoetius, 
"*■    Tending  his  wounded  friend.     Meanwhile  the  Greeks  and  the 

Trojans 
Fought,  in  confusion  mixed.     No  more  might  the  trench  for  protection 
Serve,  which  the  Greeks  had  dug,  nor  the  rampart  broad,  that  above  it 
Frowned,  which  to  guard  their  ships  they  had  reared.     'Twas  built, 

and  around  it 
Drove  they  the  trench,  while  yet  to  the  Gods  were  no  hecatombs 

offered, 
Prayers  were  there  none  addressed,  that  a  guard  it  might  prove  to  their 

vessels, 
And  to  their  costly  spoil.     With  adverse  Gods  was  the  structure 
Finished.     With  adverse  Gods,  no  work  of  man  is  enduring. 
Therefore,  while  Hector  lived,  and  Achilles  raged ;  while  to  Priam  (10) 
Still  unsubdued,  the  sway  remained  of  his  city  and  nation, 
So  long  only  endured  that  mighty  wall  of  the  Grecians. 
But,   when  the  power  of  Troy   was  quelled  a?id  her  heroes   were 

slaughtered, 
When  after  ten  long  years  the  city  lay  smoking  in  ruins, 
When,  of  the  Greeks  though  many  were  left,  yet  many  had  perished, 
And,  to  their  dear-loved  homes  the  survivors  returned  in  their  vessels, 
Then  took  counsel  together  Poseidon  and  Phoebus  Apollo, 
And  to  destroy  it  resolved.     Then  brought  they  the  rivers  to  aid 

them, 


248  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XII. 

All  that  from  Ida's  height  pour  down  their  streams  to  the  ocean. 
Rhesus,  Heptaporus  lent  their  floods,  Grenicus  and  Rhodius,      (20) 
Mighty  Caresus,  Asepus,  and  holy  Scamander  assisted, 
Simoi's  too,  on  whose  banks  the  bofies  of  many  a  hero 
Mouldered,   and  men   half  gods;    where  shields   lay  scattered  and 

helmets. 
Thither  by  Phoebus  Apollo  were  all  their  courses  diverted. 
Nine  whole  days  did  they  beat  on  the  walls  :  while  Zeus  from  the 

mountains, 
Poured  down  in  ceaseless  rains,  to  wash  them  away  and  destroy  them, 
Wielding  his  powerful  trident,  Poseidon,  lord  of  the  earthquake, 
Led  the  assault,  uprooting  the  strong  foundations,  and  whelming 
Timbers  and  stones,  which  the  Greeks  with  toil  had  piled,  in  the  ocean. 
All  on  the  shores  of  Hellespont's  stream  lay  levelled  and  even,      (30) 
By  the  returning  sand  swept  o'er,  and  buried  for  ever. 
Thus   was   the   wall   demolished.     The    streams,    restored    to    their 

channels, 
Glided  in  smooth  and  peaceful  flow,  as  of  old,  through  the  pastures. 
This  for  later  years  was  reserved,  for  Poseidon  and  Phoebus 
Destined.     But  now  the  flames  of  war  arid  the  rage  of  the  battle 
Burned  round  the  strong-built  wall ;   and  the  battered  beams  of  its 

turrets, 
Rattled  with  shafts  and  stones  :   while  the  Greeks  cooped  up  and 

confounded 
Under  the  scourge  of  angry  Zeus,  were  huddled  together, 
Close  round  their  hollow  ships,  and  shrank  from  the  terrors  of  Hector, 
Who,  in  his  might,  like  a  wintry  storm  kept  raging  around  them.   (40) 
As  when  a  lion  or  mountain  boar  turns  round  on  his  hunters, 
Fiercely  glaring ;    on  men  and  dogs  in  his  fury  he  rushes  : 
Massed  together  they  stand  with  compacted  strength  to  resist  him 
Hurling  from  strong  and  praclised  hands  full  many  a  jav'lin. 
He  nor  fears  nor  retreats.     The  fiery  force  of  his  nature 
Drives  him  on  to  the  fight,  though  death  be  the  end  that  awaits  him. 
Often  he  turns  and  makes  a  rush;   and  wherever  he  rushes 
Back  they  recede,  and  break  their  front,  giving  way  to  his  fury. 
Thus  went  Hector  careering  along  through  the  host  in  his  chariot, 


Book  XI I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  249 

Urging  his  warriors  to  leap  the  trench.    In  vain :  for  their  horses,  (50) 
Trembling,  refused  the  leap.     Loud  neighing  they  stood  on  its  margin, 
Pawing  the  ground,  in  affright  at  the  yawning  gulf.     For  a  chariot 
That  were  no  easy  bound;  no  light  adventure  its  passage. 
Steep  down  on  either  side  was  the  precipice  scarped,  overhanging 
Just  at  the  very  verge ;  and  with  sharp  palisades,  was  the  bottom 
Thickly  and  firmly  beset,  in  bristling  array ;   by  the  Grecians, 
Planted,  to  face  and  repel  th'approach  of  hostile  invaders. 
O'er  it  no  car  might  pass  by  horses  drawn — but  the  footmen, 
Eagerly  longed  to  attempt  the  feat,  and  break  through  the  barrier. 
Thus  then Polydamas  proffered  advice,  brave  Hector  approaching:  (60) 

"  Heel  or  !  ye  leaders  of  Troy  !  and  ye  brave  confederate  chieftains  ! 
Madness  it  were,  to  attempt  yon  trench  with  horses  and  chariots. 
Steep  is  the  plunge,  and  lo  !  what  a  range  of  stakes  at  the  bottom 
Pointed  and  sharp  appear ;  and  behind  is  the  wall  of  the  Grecians. 
Never  can  horsemen  there  descend,  nor  fight,  if  descended, 
Wedged  in  so  narrow  a  space ;  where  wounds  and  death  would  await 

them. 
If  'tis  the  will  of  thundering  Zeus  that  the  Grecians  should  perish, 
If  he  will  aid  our  arms  and  grant  us  safety  and  triumph, 
Welcome  indeed  were  the  boon,  and  would  that  at  once  it  were 

granted  ! 
So  shall  they  fall  inglorious,  afar  from  their  homes  and  there  country:  (70) 
But  should  they  turn,  should  a  sally  be  made  from  the  ships,  on  our 

warriors, 
Here  in  this  deep  sunk  trench,  entangled  and  crowded  together, 
Hardly  a  man  of  us  all,  methinks,  would  escape  in  the  struggle 
Back  to  the  city,  to  bear  the  news,  from  the  rallying  Grecians. 
Therefore  be  warned,  and  let  all  adopt  the  advice  I  shall  offer. 
Let  our  attendants  detain  at  the  trench  our  horses  and  chariots, 
All  of  us  then  on  foot,  full  armed,  and  closely  compacted, 
Follow  great  Hector's  lead  :  and  the  Greeks  will  fly  from  our  onset, 
If,  as  it  seems,  destruction  at  length  impend  on  their  army." 

Thus  he  spake ;  and  his  safe  advice  was  pleasing  to  Hector.       (80) 
Down  to  the  ground  at  once  he  sprang  full  armed  from  his  chariot ; 
Nor  did  the  rest  in  their  cars  remain,  but  dismounting,  in  order 


250 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XII. 


Formed,  and  at  once  rushed  on,  when  they  saw  the  example  of  Hector. 
Each  man  his  orders  gave  to  his  charioteer,  in  attendance 
Ranged,  at  the  trench's  brink  to  retain  his  steed  and  his  chariot. 
Breaking  then  into  bands,  they  formed  in  line,  and  in  order 
Marched,  in  five  columns  distinct,  five  separate  leaders  obeying. 
Hector,  the  first  commander,  by  brave  Polydamas  aided, 
His  was  the  strongest  band,  and  the  bravest ;  those  who  the  rampart 
Longed  to  assault,  and  bursting  through  it,  to  fight  at  the  vessels.     (90) 
Third  in  command,  Cebriones  marched.    To  the  charge  of  his  chariot 
Hector  a  younger  and  less  distinguished  chief  had  appointed. 
Paris  commanded  the  next,  with  Alcathous  joined,  and  Agenor, 
Helenus  led  the  third  with  Deiphobus,  glo?'ious  and  Godlike, 
Both  of  them  Priam's  sons  and  Asius  with  these  was  united 
Third  in  command :  (great  Asius,  Hyrtacus'  son,  who  his  horses 
Fiery  and  tall  from  Arisbe  drove  and  the  stream  of  Selleis). 
Fourth  in  order  a  band  by  the  noble  son  of  Anchises 
Godlike  ^Eneas  was  led.     With  him  were  the  sons  of  Antenor, 
Acamas  brave  and  Archilochus,  chiefs  experienced  in  battles.    (100) 
Mighty  Sarpedon  led  the  bold  confederate  warriors, 
Close  at  his  side  were  Glaucus  and  warlike  Asteropaeus, 
Known  to  him  well  as  the  bravest  and  best -of  all  their  commanders 
Next  to  himself:  for  he  far  surpassed  all  others  in  valour. 
On  then  marched  they,  shield  touching  shield,  and  burning  with  ardour 
Greece    to    encounter.      Proudly    they    deemed    that    none    could 

resist  them, 
All  would  before  them   be  swept,  and   the   Greeks   hurled  back  to 

their  vessels. 
All  the  Trojans,  and  all  the  allies  far-summoned  to  aid  them, 
Acted  at  once  on  the  counsel  by  brave  Polydamas  offered. 
Asius  alone,  great  Hyrtacus'  son,  refused  his  compliance,         (no) 
[All  unused  to  control)  nor  committed  his  car  to  a  servant, 
Thinking  to  force  his  way  through  the  gates  and push  on  to  the  vessels. 
Rash,  and  by  fate  for  destruclion  marked!    No  more  was  he  destined 
Borne  on  his  car  from  the  Grecian  ships  in  safety  and  triumph 
Back  to  return  to  his  home  in  wind-swept  Ilion's  city. 
Soon  by  the  spear  of  mighty  Idomeneus,  son  of  Deucalion, 


Book  XII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  251 

Doomed,  by  an  evil  fate  o'erwhelmed  and  entangled,  to  perish. 
Far  to  the  left  of  the  line  of  ships  he  drove,  where  the  Grecians 
Hurrying    away   from    the    field   with    their   cars   and   steeds   were 

retreating, 
Thither  he   pushed   in   pursuit,   and   the  gate   had  reached  where 

the  doorway  (I2°) 

Standing  wide  open  he  found,  and  the  bar  removed  that  secured  it. 
Held  by  the  Greeks  unclosed  was  the  gate,  to  receive  their  companions, 
Who,  from  the  battle  escaped,  to  their  ships  were  flying  for  safety. 
Eagerly  forward  he  drove,  and  with  clamorous  shouts  his  companions 
Followed,  for  now  they  thought  that  surely  nought  could  resist  them, 
But  that  at  length  derpoivered,  the  Greeks  to  their  ships  would  be  driven : 
Soon  undeceived !     Two  heroes  bold  stood  guarding  the  gateway, 
Men  of  the  strong  Lapithaean  race,  high-hearted  and  fearless, 
Brave  Polypcetes,  great  Peirithous'  son,  and  beside  him 
Huge  as  death-dealing  Ares,  the  stalwart  form  of  Leonteus.     (130) 
These  in  front  of  the  lofty  gates  stood  forth,  and  the  passage 
Barred  against  hostile  approach.    Like  two  tall  oaks  on  the  mountains 
Firmly  fixed  by  their  vast  and  wide-spread  roots,  and  abiding 
Many  a  day,  unmoved,  the  wintry  rain  and  the  tempest : 
Thus  those  heroes  twain,  in  their  might  and  valour  confiding, 
Fearless  awaited  the  coming  foe,  nor  flinched  from  their  stations. 
On  came  the  Trojans  against  the  strong-built  wall  in  a  body, 
Holding  their  leathern  bucklers  aloft  and  terribly  shouting. 
Close  round  Asius  their  Prince  were  Iamenus  grouped  and  Orestes, 
Acamas,  Asius'  son,  and  Thoon  and  brave  (Enomaus.  (I4°) 

They,  who  at  first  were  exhorting  the  Greeks  within  to  be  steady, 
Firmly  to  stand  to  their  arms  and  guard  their  ships  from  destruction, 
Soon  as  they  saw,  to  assault  the  gate,  the  Trojans  advancing, 
Heard  the  cries,  and  beheld  the  flight  of  the  terrified  Grecians, 
Forward  rushed ;  and  took  their  stand  in  front  of  the  gateway, 
Eager  to  fight :  like  fierce  and  savage  boars  in  the  mountains 
Rushing  to  meet  the  tumultuous  approach  of  dogs  and  of  hunters. 
Slantwise  across  the  glades  they  dash.     Mid  the  crash  of  the  forest 
Trampled  and  cut    to    the   root,   they  grind   their   tusks,   and  the 

white  foam 


252  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XII, 


Flies  from    their  jaws ;    and    regardless    of    death    they    rush   on 

the  jav'lins.  (I5°) 

Thus  they  rushed  on  :  and  the  shining  brass  of  their  armour  resounded 
Ringing  with  blows  in  front.    Right  bravely  they  struggled,  relying 
Both   on   their   own   vast   might,  and   the   aid   of  their  friends  on 

the  rampart. 
These  on  the  foe  beneath  from  the  lofty  height  of  the  turrets 
Hurled  down  massive  stones  in  a  last  and  desperate  effort, 
Yet  from  destruction  to  save  themselves,  their  tents,  and  their  galhes. 
Thick  as  the  snowflakes  fill  the  air,  when  the  blasts  of  the  winter 
Drift  them  along,  with  the  shadowy  clouds,  and  whiten  the  pastures. 
So  from  the  hands  alike  of  Trojans  and  Greeks  did  the  missiles 
Pour;  and  a  dry  and  clattering  sound  arose  from  the  helmets      (160) 
Battered  by  tumbling  crags  ;  and  the  high-bossed  orbs  of  the  bucklers. 
Asius,  Hyrtacus'  son,  then  groaned  with  despite,  and  indignant 
Smote  on  his  thigh  with  his  hand,  and  thus  gave  vent  to  his  anger : 
"Father  Zeus!     Thy  faith  is  void,  thy  promise  deceitful! 
How   could  I  e'er   suppose   that  the  Greeks,   thus  pressed,  would 

resist  us, 
Turn  on  our  strength  and  abide  th'  assault  of  our  conquering  armies  ? 
See!  how,  like  active  and  lithsome  wasps,  or  bees,  that  in  crannies 
Build  their  nests  in  some  rugged  pass,  and  repel  their  assailants, 
Hov'ring  around  their  hollow  domes ;  and,  reluctant  to  quit  them, 
Fight    to    the    last    in    defence    of   their    hidden    stores   and  their 

offspring;  -     (I7°) 

So  do  these  Greeks  still  cling  to  their  gates,  nor  cease  to  defend  them ; 
And,  though  there  be  but  two,  set  capture  and  death  at  defiance." 
Thus  he  spake.     But  Zeus  regardless  heard  his  remonstrance, 
Hector  alone  was  his  care.     Him  only  he  destined  for  glory. 

Others,  meanwhile  at  distant  gates  were  collected  and  fighting. 
Hard  'twere  for  mortal  bard  their  deeds  to  relate  or  their  praises 
Sing:  for  round  all  the  walls  the  conflict  of  stones  and  of  weapons 
Raged  like  a  fiery  storm.  Sore  pressed,  and  perforce,  for  their  vessels 
Battled  the  Greeks ;  while  all  those  Gods  who  favoured  the  Argives 
Grieving,  the  struggle  beheld,  forbid  to  assist  or  to  save  them.  (180) 
Still  unsubdued  at  their  post  the  brave  Lapithaeans  resisted. 


Book  XII.]  7  HE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  253 

Stern  Polypoetes  first,  Peirithous'  son,  with  his  jav'lin 
Damasus  smote.     The  spear  through  the  brazen  cheek  of  his  helmet 
Drove :  nor  resisted  the  stubborn  cone,  but  the  point  of  the  weapon 
Broke  through  the  bone  and  clave  the  skull,  and  the  brains  of  the  hero 
Scattered  abroad.     Thus  Damasus  fell,  as  he  rushed  to  the  combat. 
Pylon  and  Ormenus  next  he  slew,  and  despoiled  of  their  armour. 
Pierced  through  the  belt  by  the  spear  of  Leonteus,  scion  of  Ares, 
Brave  Hippomachus  fell,  the  noble  Antimachus'  offspring. 
Instant  the  viclor  drew  from  its  sheath  his  glittering  falchion,         (190) 
And  on  Antiphates  rushed  through  the  broken  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
Grappling  him,  hand  to  hand ;  and  supine  he  fell,  in  his  death-pang. 
Menon,  Iamenus,  next  he  slew,  and  valiant  Orestes. 
Headlong,  one  on  another,  he  dashed  to  earth  and  despoiled  them 
One  and  all,  as  they  lay,   of  their  bright  and  glittering  armour. 
Thus  while  these  two  were  engaged,  by  Polydamas  headed  and 
Heaor, 
All  the  best  of  the  Trojan  youth,  who  were  eager  to  combat, 
Break  down  the  Grecians'  wall  and  burn  their  vessels,  were  standing 
Gathered  in  anxious  suspense  at  the  brink  of  the  trench,  undecided. 
Just  when  about  to  cross,  in  the  space  dividing  the  armies  (200) 

Close  on  their  left  had  a  sign  appeared.    High  soaring  an  eagle 
Bore  in  his  talons  a  bleeding  snake,  still  living  and  hissing, 
Twined  in  a  monstrous  coil,  yet  fierce,  unconquered,  and  struggling. 
Backward  writhing  his  head,  he  stung  the  bird  in  the  bosom, 
Close  to  his  neck,  who  dropped  the  snake,  all  smarting  with  anguish, 
Tossing  him  down  to  the  earth,  in  the  midst  of  the  terrified  army : 
Then  on  loud  clanging  wings,  swift  floated  away  on  the  breezes. 
Shuddered  the  Trojans  with  fear  when  they  saw  the  serpent  among 

them 
Writhing,  the  dire  portent  of  ./Egis-bearing  Kronion.  (209) 

Thus  then  his  thoughts  Polydamas  spake,  fierce  Hector  approaching  : 
"Hector !  thou  chidest  me  oft  when    I   raise  my  voice  in    our 
councils 
Giving  thee  good  advice  ;  for  that  wrong  and  unseemly  thou  deem'st  it 
Either  in  council  or  war,  for  a  citizen,  one  of  the  people, 
Aught  thou  say'st  to  oppose,  or  not  to  support  thee  in  all  things. 


254  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XII. 

Yet  will  I  freely  speak  my  mind.      The  occasion  dema?ids  it. 

Let  us  no  farther  advance,  nor  fight  the  Greeks  at  their  vessels. 

All  will  end  in  defeat  and  disaster,  sure  as  this  omen 

Comes,  our  Trojans  to  warn,  and  forbid  their  assault  on  the  rampart. 

Lo !  on  our  left  in  the  open  space,  high  soaring,  an  eagle 

Bore  in  his  talons  a  bleeding  serpent  alive  :  yet  he  dropped  it      (220) 

Forced  to  relinquish  his  hold  ere  home  to  his  nest  he  could  bear  it, 

Forced  to  forego  the  hope  of  a  plenteous  meal  for  his  nestlings. 

Thus  though  we  burst  our  way  through  the  gates  and  walls  of  the 

Grecians, 
Strong  in  our  might,  and  themselves  before  us  fly,  we  shall  find  it 
No  light  task  to  return  by  the  way  we  came,  and  in  order. 
Many  a  Trojan  corpse  shall  we  leave  behind,  in  the  conflict 
Slain  by  the  Grecian  spears  in  defence  of  their  tents  and  their  vessels, 
So  would  each  augur  declare,  of  experience  and  skill  to  interpret 
Omens  divine  :  by  his  brethren  approved,  believed  by  the  people." 

Crest-waving  Hector  replied  with  a  scornful  look  of  displeasure  1(230) 
"  Think  not,  Polydamas,  counsels  like  these  will  meet  my  approval. 
Easily  might'st  thou  a  nobler  conclusion  have  drawn  from  the  omen. 
But  if  in  serious  mood  and  earnest  faith  thou  hast  spoken, 
Then  most  surely  th'  immortal  Gods  have  deprived  thee  of  reason. 
And  wouldst  thou  bid  me  then  forget  that  solemn  assurance 
Giv'n  me  by  thundering  Zeus  himself  so  late;  or  distrust  it  ? 
Bid  me  rely  on  the  flitting  of  broad-wing'd  birds,  and  their  movements 
Watch,  whether  right  or  left  they  fly, — to  east  or  to  westward — 
Soar  in  the  light  of  dawn,  or  plunge  in  night  and  in  darkness? 
Careless  I  view  such  signs.    They  concern  me  not,  nor  disturb  me.  (240) 
Zeus  is  our  guide  and  protector.     His  sov'reign  will  we  accomplish: 
Zeus,  who  supreme  o'er  mortals  and  Gods  extends  his  dominion. 
One  and  the  best  of  omens  is  ours  to  fight  for  our  country. 
Thou  of  all  men  hast  least  to  fear  from  war  and  its  struggles, 
For  should  the  rest  of  us,  one  and  all,  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Perish  beneath  the  Argive  spears,  thy  risk  would  be  trifling, 
Wanting  the  heart  to  fight,  and  the  spirit  that  leads  into  danger. 
But  should  I  see  thee  hanging  back,  or  others  persuading, 
{Filling  their  souls  with  groundless  fears  like  thine  own,)  to  desert  us,

Pierced  by  my  vengeful  spear  thy  recreant  life  shalt  thou  forfeit."    (250) 
Thus  having  spoken,  he  led  the  way,  and  with  shouting  and  clamour 
Followed  the  troops.    Then  thundering  Zeus  from  the  mountains  of  Ida 
Sent  forth  a  mighty  blast,  which,  raising  the  dust  in  a  whirlwind, 
Drove  it  full  on  the  Greeks.     Their  courage  he  quelled,  and  their 

ardour 
Damped:  and  with  glorious  hopes  the  Trojans  encouraged  and  Hector 
Who  on  his  manifest  aid,  and  their  own  fierce  valour  relying, 
Now  rushed  on  to  assault  that  mighty  wall  of  the  Grecians  : 
Tore  down  the  battlements  high,  and  the  solid  strength  of  the  breast- 
work ; 
Heaved  with  levers  amain  at  each  buttress  firm,  which  projecting 
Forward,  in  front  of  the  towers  the  Greeks  had  fixed  to  support  them ; 
Trusting  that,  these  once  levelled,  the  wall  must  yield.      But  the 
Argives  (261) 

Fell  not  away  in  that  hour  of  fierce  and  despe?-ate  trial. 
Buckler  to  buckler,  man  to  man,  they  filled  the  embrasures, 
Show'ring  on  all  who  approached  both  stones-  and  spears  from  behind 
them. 
High  on  the  wall  through  the  Danaan  host  the  united  Aiantes 
Went  their  round,  exhorting,  and  cheering  them  on  to  the  combat. 
Some  they  addressed  with  warm  and  encouraging  words  of  approval, 
Others  rebuked,  whom  haply  they  found  neglecting  their  duty: 
"Hear  me,  my  friends!  Each  Greek,  whatever  his  force  or  his  valour, 
Hero,  and  warrior  of  small  renown,  the  strong  and  the  feeble,       (270) 
Fight !    There  is  work  for  all — though  all  be  not  equal  in  valour. 
All  of  you  see  how  sore  we  are  pressed.    But  let  no  man  among  you 
Scared  by  yon  vaunter's  boasts  to  our  ships  but  dream  0/"  retreating. 
Rather  push  on  and  meet  the  foe,  supporting  each  other. 
So  shall  Olympian  Zeus,  your  determi?ied  courage  rewarding 
Change  to  defeat  their  success  and  drive  them  back  to  their  city." 
Loudly  thus  did  the  two  brave  warriors  cheer  on  the  Grecians, 
And,  as  the  snow-flakes  fall  on  a  wintry  day,  when  the  Thund'rer 
Brings  round  the  season's  change  in  the  deep  design  of  his  counsels, 
Op'ning  his  fleecy  stores  on  high  he  displays  them  to  mortals:       (280) 
Lulled  are  the  winds,  and  the  silent  snow  falls  thick :  on  the  mountains

First;   and  each  summit  and   craggy   peak   shows   white:    o'er   the 

meadows, 
Next;   and  their  clovery  pride  it  conceals,    and   the   husbandman's 

labours ; 
Wide  o'er  the  shores  of  the  hoary  sea  then  spreads  and  the  havens : 
Bounded  alone  by  th'  advancing  wave.     All  else  it  envelopes, 
Cov'ring'it  deep;  as  the  thickening  drift  descends  and  o'erwhelms  it. 
Thus  fell  the  stony  show'r  upon  either  side,  by  the  Grecians 
Down  on  the  Troian  host,  by  the  Trojans  back  at  the  Grecians 
Hurled;  and  along  the  wall  loud  rose  the  roar  of  the  battle. 
Yet  had  not  Hector,  brave  as  he  was,  nor  the  Trojans,  succeeded  (290) 
Either  in  scaling  the  wall,  or  in  bursting  the  gates  and  their  barriers, 
Had  not  immortal  Zeus  his  son  Sarpedon  excited 
Onward,  against  th'  opposing  Greeks  to  rush  like  a  lion. 
Straightway  his  smooth  round  shield  he  upreared  and  held  it  before 

him 
Rich,  all  shining  with  plates  of  brass,  by  the  skill  of  the  artist, 
Thick  overlaid;  with  many  a  fold  of  leather  beneath  them, 
Firmly  sewn,  while  bands  of  gold  encircled  its  margin. 
This  he  advanced  on  high,  and  forward  strode  to  the  combat, 
Brandishing  two  sharp  spears.   As  a  lion  which  reared  in  the  mountains 
Strong  in  his  inborn  fierceness  and  urged  by  the  cravings  of  hunger 
Down  on  the  flock  descends,  close  penned  albeit  and  guarded:    (301) 
Who,  though  he  find  the  shepherds  alert  and  prepared  to  repel  him, 
Keeping  with  dogs  and  spears  their  nightly  watch  o'er  the  sheep-fold, 
Scorns  to  retreat  unhurt,  and  leave  the  prey  unattempted. 
In,  at  all  risks,  he  springs,  and  seizes  the  first  he  encounters, 
Pouncing  upon  hi?n,  reckless  of  wounds,  of  darts  and  of  jav'lins. 
Not  with  less  ardent  prompting  the  spirit  of  godlike  Sarpedon, 
Urged  him  to  rush  at  the  wall,  and  break  through  the  strength  of  its 

breastworks, 
Turning  to  Glaucus  then,  Hippolochus'  son,  he  addressed  him: 
"Glaucus,  my  friend!     Why   claim   we   the   chiefest   place   in   our 

nation,  (3IQ) 

Highest  in  honour,  first  at  the  festal  board,  when  the  wine-cup 
Flows  at  our  Lycian  feasts?    Why  as  Gods  do  the  people  regard  us? 


Book  XII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  257 

Why  upon  Xanthus'  banks  do  the  fairest  and  widest  allotments 
Own  us  as  lords,  the  best  of  the  vineyard,  best  of  the  corn-land? 
Should  we  not  then  be  found  commanding  the  Lycian  squadrons, 
Foremost  ever  in  martial  feats  and  the  heat  of  the  battle? 
So  shall  each  mail-braced  Lycian  warrior  exclaim  when  he  sees  us : 
'Truly  these  sov'reigns  of  ours  are  no  inglorious  weaklings 
'■Born  but  to  feed  on  the  fat  of  the  land  and  in  idle  enjoyment 
'Drink  of  the  honey-sweet  wine.     They  rule.     They  have  spirit  and 
vigour.  (32°) 

'Ever  in  front  of  our  armies  we  find  them,  leading  the  onset' 
Oh !  my  friend :  if  withdrawn  from  war  and  its  dangers  avoiding, 
Endless  life  and  perpetual  youth  were  the  portion  of  mortals, 
Neither  would  I  rush  headlong  on,  to  fight  with  the  foremost, 
Nor  would  I  send  thee  forth  to  join  in  the  glorious  conflict. 
But  since  in  peace  a  thousand  deaths  beset  us  on  all  sides, 
Deaths  which  none  can  foresee  or  avoid,  let  us  on ;  and  for  glory 
Strike.    We  shall  win  it  ourselves  or,  falling,  confer  it  on  others." 
Thus  he  spake :  nor  did  Glaucus  refuse.    And  exultingly  onward 
Both  advanced  at  the  head  of  the  far-famed  Lycian  forces.      (330) 
These  with  alarm  to  the  tow'r  which  he  held  advancing,  Menestheus 
Peteos'  son  beheld  close  banded,  bearing  destruction. 
Anxious  along  the  Grecian  line  he  gazed,  to  discover 
Haply,  some  chief  at  hand  who  might  lend  his  aid  to  repel  them. 
Not  far  off  th'  Aiantes  twain  he  perceived,  for  the  combat 
Always  prepared  and  eager,  and  Teucer  just  to  the  rampart 
Come  from  his  tent.    But  to  reach  them  no  shout  might  avail  through 

the  uproar, 
Raging  on  all  sides  round,  and  the  din  that  mounted  to  heaven, 
Clashing  of  stricken  shields  and  of  battered  helms,  and  the  thunder 
Echoing  from  all  the  gates  (for  all  were  attacked,  and  the  Trojans  (340) 
Crowded  around  them,  exerting  their  utmost  efforts  to  burst  them). 
So  to  th'  Aiantes  a  message  he  sent  by  Thootes  the  herald : 
"Noble  Thootes!  run  with  all  speed,  and  summon  th'  Aiantes. 
Both,  it  were  better,  should  come.     There  is  need  of  both;  for  im- 
pending, 
Swift  and  sudden  destruction  awaits  us  here  unassisted.

Such  and  so  fierce  is  the  Lycians'  attack,  who,  whate'er  the  occasion, 

Most  determined  of  all  our  foes,  advance  to  the  battle. 

But  if  the  stress  of  war  be  there  severe,  and  its  labours, 

Then  let  Oileus  remain:  let  the  brave  Telamonian  Aias 

Come,  and  let  Teucer  bring  his  unerring  bow  and  his  arrows."     (350) 

Thus  he  spake  and  the  herald  his  message  receiving  departed. 
Swiftly  along  the  line  of  the  bronze-mailed  Greeks  on  the  rampart 
Running,  th'  Aiantes  he  found  at  their  post,  and  thus  he  addressed 

them: 
"Noble  Aiantes!  chiefs  of  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia, 
Jove-descended  Peteos'  son  hath  sent  me  to  bid  you 
Come  with  all  speed,  for  howe'er  so  short  a  time,  to  assist  him. 
Both  of  you  come  if  you  can.    There  is  need  of  both :  for  impending 
Swift  and  sudden  destruction  awaits  him  there,  unassisted: 
Such  and  so  fierce  is  the  Lycians'  attack  who,  whate'er  the  occasion, 
Most  determined  of  all  our  foes,  advance  to  the  battle.  (360) 

But  if  here  also  the  stress  of  war  be  severe  and  its  labours, 
Then  let  Oileus  remain,  and  do  thou,  Telamonian  Aias! 
Come,  and  let  Teucer  bring  his  unerring  bow,  and  his  arrows." 

Thus  he  spake:  nor  refused  the  great  Telamonian  hero. 
Parting  however,  these  hurried  words  he  addressed  to  Oileus: 
"Aias,  my  friend!     Do  thou  remain  with  brave  Lycomedes. 
Strive  to  maintain  your  post,  and  cheer  on  the  Greeks  to  the  conflict. 
I,  for  a  while,  must  leave  you ;  for  there  my  assistance  is  needed : 
Soon  will  I  join  you  again,  when  once  my  task  is  accomplished." 

Thus  having  spoken,  the  great  Telamonian  Aias  departed;       (370) 
Teucer  beside  him,  his  brother,  his  father's  son;  and  Pandion 
Bearing  his  chieftain's  bended  bow,  attended  their  footsteps. 
Soon  at  the  tow'r  they  arrived,  by  brave  Menestheus  defended. 
Mounting  the  wall,  by  foes  sore  pressed  and  endangered  they  found 

him. 
Up,  as  if  swept  by  a  whirlwind's  drift,  the  Lycian  leaders 
Climbing   the   breast-work  a  footing  had  gained,  and  dire  was   the 

clamour, 
Fierce  the  encounter  of  arms :  for  hand  to  hand  was  the  combat. 
First  in  the  fight,  the  great  Telamonian  Aias  a  hero,

Godlike  Sarpedon's  companion  and  friend,  the  valiant  Epicles 
Slew.     Upraising  a  rugged  stone  which  high  on  the  rampart   (380) 
Coping  a  battlement  lay  (such  a  mass  as  hardly  a  mortal, 
Such  as  now  live,  in  the  pride  of  youth  and  strength  could  have 

lifted, 
Straining  with  both  his  hands)  on  his  head  from  above  he  discharged  it. 
Crushing  the  cone  of  his  four-plumed  helm  it  fell,  and  within  it 
All  the  bones  of  his  skull.     Head  foremost  hurled  from  the  rampart 
Down,  like  a  diver,  he  plunged  and,  the  wreck  of  a  man,  he  expired. 

Glaucus,  in  acl  to  mount,  was  grappling  the  wall,  and  unguarded 
Thrust  forth  his  naked  arm.     This  Teucer  marked,  and  an  arrow 
Sent  from  his  bow  which  a  wound  inflicted,  disabling  the  hero. 
Down    from   the   wall   he   sprang,    dissembling    his    hurt    lest    the 

Grecians  (39°) 

Seeing  him  struck,  might  scoff  and  insult  him  with  words  of  derision. 
This  Sarpedon  with  grief  beheld;   for  Glaucus  retreating 
Soon  he  perceived  :   but  his  grief  with  rage  was  mixed.     With  his 

jav'lin, 
Full  at  Alcmseon,  Thestor's  son,  he  thrust,  and  transfixed  him, 
Quickly  withdrawing  the  weapon,  which  dragged  him  down ;   and 

Alcmaeon, 
Forward  fell  on  his  face,  and  his  bright  arms  rattled  around  him. 
Then  with  a  spring,  Sarpedon  the  battlement  seized,  and  it  yielded, 
Under  the  strain  of  his  mighty  grasp,  wide  toppling  in  ruin, 
Stripping  the  rampart,  and  op'ning  a  breach  where  many  might  enter. 
Aias  and  Teucer  at  once  took  deadly  aim  at  the  hero.  (4°°) 

Teucer's  shaft  struck  sharp  on  the  glittering  band,  which  his  buckler 
Fastened  across  his  breast;  but  Zeus  averted  destruction, 
Suffering  not  his  son  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians  to  perish. 
Leaping  upon  him,  Aias  dismissed  his  spear,  and  the  buckler 
Rang  with  the  blow  but  it  pierced  not  through :  yet  it  checked  him 

advancing. 
Back  from  the  breach  some  space  he  recoiled,  yet  not  as  retreating  : 
Turning  him  round  to  his  godlike  Lycian  troops,  he  addressed  them, 
Loth  to  relinquish  his  ardent  hopes  of  conquest  and  glory : 
"  Lycians  !   why,  forget  ye  your  ancient  renow?i  and  your  valour?

Think  you  that  I,  unsupported,  how  brave  soe'er,  through  yon  barrier 
(Burst  by  my  strength  though  it  be)  can  hew  out  a  path  to  the  vessels  ?  (41 1) 
Follow  me  then !  where  numbers,  no  less  than  courage,  are  needed." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  Lycians  rebuked  by  the  words  of  their 

sov'reign, 
Pressed  round  the  prince,  by  his  prowess  inspired,  revering  his  wisdom. 
Nor  did  the  Greeks  meanwhile  neglect  to  concentre  their  phalanx, 
Drawn  up  within  the  wall,  for  they  knew  what  a  struggle  impended. 
Nor  could  the  Lycians  brave  succeed  in  breaking  the  Grecians, 
Forcing  a  path  through  the  breach,  and  cutting  their  way  to  the  vessels  ; 
Nor  could  these  from  the  wall  drive  back  the  Lycian  warriors, 
Now  that  they  held  the  breach,  and  had  gained  firm  footing  upon 

it.  (420) 

As  when  two  men  in  narrow  space  disputing  their  bound'ries, 
Each  with  his  measuring  rod  in  hand,  at  the  line  of  division 
Stand,  of  their  common  field,  and  maintain  their  claim  to  possession  : 
Thus  did  the  wall  divide  the  contending  hosts.     In  the  struggle 
Thick  descended  the  blows  on  their  broad  round  shields,  and  the  targets 
Lightly  upborne,  whose  tough  bull-hides  defended  their  bosoms. 
Many  a  wound  was  giv'n  and  received  from  their  pitiless  weapons. 
Here,  through  the  back  exposed   came  the  deadly  thrust,  when   a 

recreant 
Turned  him  to  flight :  there,  pierced  through  his  buckler  perished  a 

hero. 
Battlement,  buttress  and  lofty  tow'r  in  that  desperate  struggle,   (430) 
Streamed  alike  with  the  mi?igled  blood  of  Greeks  and  of  Trojans. 
Yet  had  the  Greeks  no  thought  of  flight  ■  but  straight  and  unswerving 
Held  their  line ; — as  some  diligent  matron,  just  in  her  dealings, 
Poises  the  wool  in  her  scales,  and  draws  it  out,  till  it  equals 
Nicely,  its  weight ;  thus  earning  a  scanty  support  for  her  children. 
Thus  on  an  even  poise  hung  balanced  the  fates  of  the  battle, 
Up  to  the  time  when  Zeus  should  crown  great  Hector  with  glory, 
Destined  the  first  to  break  in,  and  o'erpass  the  fence  of  the  Grecians. 
Then  with  a  mighty  shout  he  called  up  his  troops  to  the  combat: 
"Now  is  your  time,  ye  Trojans  !     Now  burst  through  the  wall,  and  be 

ready,  (44°)

Torches  to  hurl  on  the  ships,   and  in    one    vast   blaze    to   consume 

them." 
Thus  in  loud  and  exciting  tones  he  spake,  and  the  Trojans 
Heard  with  fresh  ki?idled  zeal,  and  rushed  in  crowds  to  the  rampart, 
Jav'lins  in  hand.     And  they  climbed  the  wall,  and  the  battlements 

mounted. 
Heel  or  then  seized  on  a  mighty  stone,  which  in  front  of  the  gateway 
Stood,  like  the  prow  of  a  ship  projecting,  broad  at  the  bottom, 
Sharp  at  the  point ;  which  scarce  two  men  now  living  among  us, 
Chos'n  from  among  the  strongest,  could  heave  from  the  ground  to  a 

waggon, 
Ev'n  with  a  lever's  aid :   but  alone  he  easily  raised  it, 
(Zeus,  the  son  of  mysterious  Kronos,  lightening  the  burden).  (450) 
Not  with  more  ease,  scarce  feeling  the  wooly  weight,  does  the  shepherd 
Bear  off  in  both  his  hands  some  ram's  huge  fleece  from  the  shearing. 
Poising  the  rock,  he  approached  the  lofty  gate,  which  compacted 
Stood,  with  its  planks  by  massive  beams  cross-braced,  and  within  it 
Fast'ning  its  two  broad  doors  were  ponderous  clasps,  that  uniting, 
Clenched,  and  with  one  strong  bolt  were  secured.     Confronting  it, 

Heaor 
Planted  himself  on  wide-extended  feet,  to  concentrate 
All  his  force  on  the  blow.     And  it  fell  1    Struck  full  in  the  centre, 
Down  went  the  gate,  with  a  thundering  crash;  out-torn  from  the  frame- 
work, 
All  the  hinges  were  wrenched,  and  the  crag  broke  through,  by  its 

impulse  (460) 

Shiv'ring  the  planks.     Nor  resisted  the  bars,  sent  flying  in  splinters, 
This  way  and  that  through  the  air.     In  rushed  the  conquering  Hector 
Dreadful  in  aspect  as  gloomy  night.     Far  flashed  from  his  armour, 
Lurid  and  fitful  gleams  as  he  moved.     Two  lances  he  brandished, 
As  through  the  gate  he  sprang,  with  his  eyes  in  flame.     To  resist  him 
Vain  were  all  mortal  force ;  for  none  but  a  God  might  have  dared  it. 
Turning  him  round  to  the  Trojans,  he  called  them  up  to  support  him, 
Bidding   them   scale  the  wall:   and  they  hurried   in   crowds  at   his 

summons, 
Some  with  a  desperate  rush  surmounted  the  rampart,  and  others

Poseidon  observing  the  battle  from  Samos,  comes  to  the  aid  of  the

otherwise  distinguishes  himself  as  do  also  Merion  and  Menelaiis  on  the

'""PHUS  to  the  Grecian  ships  when  Zeus  had  the  Trojans  conducted, 
There  he  left  them,  engaged  in  their  toilsome  and  arduous  struggle, 
While  from  the  scene  of  slaughter  his  beaming  eyes  he  averted, 
Viewing  the  distant  lands  by  the  bold  equestrian  Thracians, 
By  the  close-combating  Mysians  held,  and  the  pure  Hippemolgi 
Nurtured  on  milk,  of  peaceful  lives,  and  the  justest  of  mortals. 
Troy  and  her  hosts  no  longer  he  deigned  to  behold.     Of  th'  immortals 
None,  he  expected,  would  dare  to  descend//-*?/^  Olympus,  and  render 
Aid,  or  encouragement  offer  to  Greece  or  Troy  in  their  co?iflicl: 

Yet,  with  a  watchful  and  anxious  gaze,  earthshaking  Poseidon    (10) 
Wond'ring,  the  long-protracled  war  and  the  turns  of  the  battle 
Viewed  from  his  Thracian  seat,  from  the  wood-clothed  mountains  of 

Samos, 
Whence  might  be  seen  far  stretching  away  the  summits  of  Ida, 
Ilion's  lofty  tow'rs  and  the  close-ranged  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
There,  from  the  ocean  rising,  he  sate,  and  sore  for  the  Argives 
Grieved,  by  the  Trojans  subdued;  and  with  Zeus  his  soul  was  indignant. 
From  the  huge  mountain's  rugged  height  in  haste  he  descended 
Striding  along;  and  its  forests  shook  and  its  pinnacles  trembled, 
Under  the  earthquake  tread  and  immortal  weight  of  the  monarch. 
Wide  over  land  and  sea,  three  strides  he  took,  and  in  JEgdd  (20) 

Planted  his  foot  at  the  fourth.     There  a  gorgeous  palace  received  him 
Deep,  deep  down  in  the  ocean  wave,  incorruptible,  golden. 


266  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

There  to  his  chariot  he  yoked  his  swift  and  brazen-hoofed  coursers, 
Crested  with  beauteous  manes  wide  floating  in  gold  o'er  their  shoulders. 
Gold   was  his  panoplied  mail,  and  the  broidered  scourge  which  he 

wielded, 
All  with  gold  was  inwrought.     Triumphant  he  mounted  his  chariot. 
Over  the  waves  it  rolled.     Sea  monsters  gambolled  around  it, 
Rising  in  shoals  from  the  deep  to  behold  their  king :  and  the  billows 
Leaping  with  joy  divided,  and  smoothed  a  path  where  the  chariot 
Skimmed  o'er  the  main;  nor  wetted  the  brazen  axle  beneath  it.      (30) 
Thus  flew  the  bounding  steeds  till  they  neared  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 

Under  the  sea  which  Tenedos  parts  from  the  mainland  of  Imbros, 
Opens  a  wide-expanding  cave  in  the  depths  of  its  waters. 
There  arrested  his  chariot  the  great  earthshaking  Poseidon, 
Loosed  his  steeds  from  the  yoke  and  strewed  them  ambrosial  fodder : 
Round  their  fetlocks  shackles  of  gold  he  cast  to  detain  them ; 
Shackles  which  none  might  unloose  or  break;  that  so  he  might  find 

them 
Ready,  awaiting  their  lord's  return.     Then  joined  he  the  Grecians. 

Troia's  hosts  meanwhile,  with  the  rage  of  the  fire  or  the  tempest 
Swept  after  Hector  in  crowds,  all  eager,  thirsting  for  battle,  (40) 

Raising  triumphant  shouts.     For  now  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Surely  they  trusted  to  capture  and  slay  their  best  and  their  bravest. 
Mighty  Poseidon  however,  who  shakes  the  world  with  his  earthquakes, 
Now  from  the  waves  uprising  assumed  the  semblance  of  Calchas ; 
Like  him  in  form  and  resounding  voice,  and  encouraged  the  Argives. 
First  th'  Aiantes  addressing,  already  alert  and  excited: 
" Noble  Aiantes!     On  you  must  Greece  rely  for  her  safety. 
Valiant  ye  are.     No  thought  of  flight  e'er  freezes  your  ardour ! 
Elsewhere  along  our  lines  I  fear  not  the  might  of  the  Trojans, 
Who  in  such  numbers  have  scaled  our  walls  and  are  rushing  upon  us. 
Sure  that  our  bright-greaved  Greeks   will   receive   their  assault  and 
repel  it.  (51) 

Here  however,  where  Hec~lor  himself,  the  fierce  and  the  fiery, 
Boasting  himself  the  fav'rite  of  Zeus,  leads  them  on  to  the  battle, 
Sorely  I  dread  lest  evil  befal  the  sons  of  Achaia. 
Wherefore  I  trust,  some  God  will  inspire  your  bosoms,  and  prompt  you 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  267 

Bravely  to  bear  your  parts  in  the  fight,  and  encourage  your  comrades. 
So  shall  ye  drive  him  back  from  the  swift-sailing  ships  i?i  confusion, 
Fierce  as  he  is;  though  Zeus  himself  be  his  friend  and  supporter." 

Thus  having  spoken,  the  world-encircling  lord  of  the  earthquake, 
Laid   upon   each  his   sceptre,   and   filled    them   with    courage   and 

vigour,  (60) 

Suppled  their  joints,  and  confirmed  the  strength  of  their  hands  and 

their  members. 
Then,  as  a  hawk  upborne  on  rapid  wing  from  his  station 
High  on  some  rugged  cliff  soars  forth  in  air,  and  his  quarry- 
Far  and  wide  o'er  the  plain  pursues  in  devious  circuit, 
Thus  from  their  presence  darted  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon. 
First  was  the  God-head  perceived  by  the  swift  O'ilean  Aias. 
Instantly  thus  he  bespoke  the  great  Telamonian  hero : 
"  Aias!  I  feel  it  within  me  !     A  God  hath  come  down  from  Olympus, 
Taking  the  prophet's  form,  and  enjoins  us  to  fight  for  our  gallies. 
He,  be  assured,  is  not  the  seer  he  resembled,  old  Calchas.        (70) 
Well  did  I  mark,  as  he  left  us,  his  gliding  feet  and  his  movements. 
Unlike  men's  is  the  carriage  of  Gods,  and  we  easily  know  them. 
Now  too,  within  my  bosom  my  heart  beats  high  for  the  combat; 
More  than  ever  my  spirit  excites  me  to  war  and  to  conquest 
Strength  is  in  every  limb,  and  my  hands  seem  nerved  for  the  battle." 

Thus  then  in  turn  replied  the  great  Telamonian  Aias  : 
"I  too  feel  the  same !  My  soul  is  stirred  in  my  bosom, 
Light  in  my  eager  grasp  is  the  spear,  and  to  bear  me  to  battle 
Wings  seem  lifting  my  feet,  and  alone  I  yearn  to  encounter 
Hector  the  son  of  Priam,  in  all  the  height  of  his  fury."  (80) 

Thus  with  exulting  joy,  these  two  brave  heroes  conferring, 
Each  unto  each  the  ardour  revealed  which  the  god  had  imparted. 
He  meanwhile,  the  great  earth-circling  Pow'r  to  the  rearward 
Passed,  where  the  Greeks  in  their  ships  had  a  respite  sought  and  a 

refuge. 
Worn   and   exhausted  with  toil,  their  limbs  were  relaxed  and  their 

bosoms 
Heaved  with  pangs  of  overwhelming  grief,  when  they  looked  on  the 

Trojans, 


268  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 


Scaling  by  thousands  the  mighty  wall  they  had  built:  and,  beholding, 
Tears  of  despite  and  shame  from  their  eyelids  streamed:  for  they  knew 

not 
How  from  so  dire  a  strait  they  should  e'er  escape.     But  Poseidon 
Mingling  among  their  ranks  restored  their  strength  and  their  courage. 
Teucer  and  Leitus  first  his  words  aroused,  and  their  ardour      (91) 
Kindled;  Thoas,  Deipyrus,  next  and  Peneleus  mighty 
Merion,  Antilochus,  warlike  chiefs,  experienced  in  battles, 
All  became   eager  to  fight,  when  in  words  like  these  he  addressed 

them : 
&lt; 'Shame  on  ye,  Argive  youths !    To  your  valour  and  strength  might  be 

trusted, 
(So  we  vainly  believed)  the  safety  of  Greece  and  her  navy. 
But  if  ye  shun  the  dangerous  fight,  and  shrink  from  the  conflict, 
Then  we  behold  at  length  the  day  when  Troy  shall  o'erwhelm  us. 
Gods!     What  a  sight  is   this!     That   these   eyes   should   e'er  have 

beheld  it! 
Dreadful!  incredible!  such  as  no  Greek  could  e'er  have  predicted!  (100) 
Trojans  close  at  your  ships !     That  cowardly  race,  who  but  lately 
Ran  like  the  timorous  deer,  a  prey  to  each  beast  of  the  forest, 
Jackals  and  pards  and  wolves ;  a  rout  of  stragglers  and  weaklings, 
Loose  in  array,  unfit  for  war,  for  its  toils  or  its  glory. 
Such  is  this  rabble  of  'Troy,  who  the  valour  and  arms  of  the  Grecians 
Never  in  times  gone  by  could  withstand :  no,  not  for  an  instant. 
Now,  from  their  city  advancing  they  beard  us  here  at  our  vessels, 
All  through  our  chiefs  misconduct,  and  lack  of  zeal  in  our  warriors 
Who,  at  his  tyranny  wroth,  refuse  to  fight,  and  our  navy 
Suffer  unguarded  to  fall,  and  themselves  to  perish  beside  it.  (IIQ) 

What,  if  it  be  his  fault,  if  blame  must  rest  on  our  leader 
Atreus'  heroic  son,  the  wide-ruling  king  Agamemnon? 
What,  though  he  foully  dishonoured  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles, 
Must  we  for  that  desert  our  posts  and  shrink  from  the  battle? 
Rather  push  on  and  retrieve.     The  brave  but  doubt  for  a  moment. 
You  of  all  others  the  last  should  be  found  giving  way  to  a  panic, 
Brave  as  ye  are,  the  flow'r  of  our  host.     For  the  weak  and  unwarlike, 
Such  I  disdain  to  blame.     They  but  yield  to  the  bent  of  their  nature. 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  269 


You  when  I  see  subdued,  my  soul  is  indignant  within  me. 

Think  not,   my  friends !   you   behold  the  worst.      Far    heavier    the 

mischief,  (I2°) 

Weakness  like  yours  will  cause.  Oh !  think  on  the  shame  and  the  ruin, 
Ready  on  all  to  alight;  for  the  last  sharp  struggle  is  pending. 
Hector  himself  approaches  your  ships.     Already  his  war-cry 
Rings  in  your  ears.    Your  gates  are  burst  and  the  foe  is  among  you." 
Thus  while  the  great  earth-shaking  god  encouraged  the  Grecians, 
Closing  around  th'  Aiantes  twain  had  collected  a  phalanx, 
Solid  and  square,  where  Ares  himself,  were  he  present  amidst  them, 
Nought  could  have  found  to  blame,  nor  Athena  disperser  of  armies. 
There  the  bravest  of  all  the  brave  stood  fronting  the  Trojans 
Spear  levelled  close  by  spear,  and  buckler  wedged  upon  buckler,  (130) 
Target  on  target,  man  upon  man,  and  helmet  on  helmet 
Nodding  in  one  compacted  and  gleaming  mass  with  their  horsetails 
Waving  in  air.     Thus  close  they  stood ;  and  the  spears  which  they 

wielded, 
Shook  with  the  force  of  their  stalwart  gripe.     Supporting  each  other 
Kept  they  their  ground,  yet  longed  to  advance,  and  yearned  for 

the  onset. 
On  came  Troy  to  the  charge,  and  Hector  in  front  of  the  Trojans, 
Rushing  amain :  like  a  boulder  crag  from  the  brow  of  a  mountain, 
Tom  by  the  wintry  floods  when  the  rain  comes  down  in  a  torrent, 
Mining  its  base,  and  loos'ning  its  hold  on  the  cliff;  and  in  ruin 
Bounding  along  it  flies,  and  the  forest  crashes  beneath  it.        (140) 
Whirled  in  its  headlong  career  o'er  the  steep  it  rolls  unimpeded 
Down  to  the  plain :  there  stops  • — in  its  path  of  destruction  arrested. 
Thus  rushed  Hector  along  with  threats  and  with  tumult,  expecting 
Soon  at  the  sea  to  arrive,  at  the  ships  and  tents  of  the  Grecians, 
Slaughtering  all  on  his  way.     But  the  serried  lines  of  the  phalanx 
Stopped  him  at  once  as  they  closed;  and  the  biting  brands  by  the 

Argives 
Wielded,  and  two-edg'd  spears  thrust  home,  presented  a  barrier 
Passing  his  might  to  surmount.     Amazed,  some  steps  he  retreated. 
Turning  him  then  to  his  troops,  in  a  thundering  voice  he  addressed 

them : 


270  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

"  Trojans  and  Lycians  all,  and  ye  staunch  Dardanian  warriors,  (150) 
Hold  your  ground  and  be  firm.    Not  long  will  the  Grecians  resist  me, 
What  though  they  stand  compacted  in  close  array  like  a  rampart. 
Soon  shall  this  spear  disperse  them.     On  Zeus  I  rely  for  assistance, 
Zeus,  the  first  of  the  Gods,  the  thundering  consort  of  Hera." 

Thus  he  spake  and  each  heart  was  stirred,  each  spirit  excited. 
Forth  stept  Deiphobus  first,  the  high-soul'd  offspring  of  Priam, 
Bearing  aloft  his  broad  round  shield  full-orbed  and  refulgent. 
Light  was  his  tread  as  secure  he  advanced  beneath  its  protection. 
Straight  at  the  prince  Meriones  aimed  his  glittering  jav'lin, 
Hurling  with  force.  It  missed  not  its  mark  but  right  in  the  centre  (160) 
Smote,  of  the  full-orb'd  shield  with  bull's-hide  stiff.    But  it  pierced  not. 
Short  at  the  shank  it  broke:  for  Deiphobus,  dreading  a  weapon 
Wielded  by  Merion's  might,  far  forward  in  front  of  his  bosom 
Held  off  the  shield  to  receive  it.    Then  back  the  Greek,  disappointed, 
Into  the  crowd  of  his  comrades  plunged,  sore  vexed  and  indignant, 
Both  for  his  ill  success  and  his  broken  spear:  and  he  hasted 
Back  to  the  camp  and  the  Grecian  ships  on  the  shore,  to  procure  him 
There,  from  the  stores  in  his  tent,  a  more  available  weapon. 

Thickened  meanwhile  the  fray,  and  loud  grew  the  roar  of  the  conflict. 
First  Telamonian  Teucer  a  chieftain  slew  of  the  Trojans,         (r70) 
Imbrius,  Mentor's  son,  renown'd  for  the  breed  of  his  horses. 
Who  at  Pedseum  dwelt,  ere  Greece  .before  Ilion  mustered, 
Medesicaste  fair  having  married,  a  daughter  of  Priam. 
But  when  the  Grecian  ships  arrived,  in  support  of  the  Trojans, 
Back  to  the  city  he  came,  and  lived  distinguished  among  them, 
Lodged  in  the  royal  palace  and  honoured  as  one  of  its  princes. 
Him   through   the   throat  great  Telamon's  son   transfixed,  and   the 

jav'lin 
Quickly  withdrew.     Down  sank  he,  as  some  tall  ash  on  a  mountain, 
Once  conspicuous,  a  well-known  mark,  by  the  axe  of  the  woodma?i 
Prostrate  laid,  with  its  leafy  crown  and  wide-spreading  branches.    (180) 
So  did  he  fall,  and  his  shining  arms  re-echoed  around  him. 
Teucer  at  once  rushed  forward  in  eager  haste  to  despoil  him. 
Hector  however  his  gleaming  spear  dismissed;  which  perceiving 
Fierce  as  it  flew,  by  a  dextrous  spring  he  escaped,  and  it  passed  him 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  271 

Close;  and  Amphimachus,  Cteatus'  son  and  grandson  of  Actor, 
Boldly  advancing  in  jront  of  his  comrades,  pierced  in  the  bosom. 
Down  he  fell  with  a  crash,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him. 
Hector  at  once  sprang  forth,  o'er  the  prostrate  form  of  the  hero 
Stooping,  to  tear  from  his  head  the  crested  helm  that  adorned  it, 
This  great  Aias  beheld,  and  his  beaming  lance  against  Hector     (190) 
Hurled :  but  in  vain,  for  the  prince  by  his  brazen  panoply  guarded, 
Scatheless   stood   and  untouched.      On   the   boss   of  his   shield  it 

alighted, 
Driv'n  with  enormous  force;  and  thrust  him  back.     He  retreated 
Leaving  the  two  fall'n  chiefs  in  the  hands  of  the  conquering  Argives. 
Stichms,  Menestheus,  Athenian  chiefs  Amphimachus  carried, 
Out  of  the  press,  unspoiled;  and  with  care  consigned  to  his  comrades. 
Imbrius  the  brave  Aiantes  themselves  bore  off  from  the  Trojans. 
As  when  two  lions  have  snatched  from  the  fangs  of  dogs,  who  had 

seized  him, 
Some  wild  goat  still  bleeding  and  newly  slain;  o'er  the  brush-wood, 
High  upraised  in  their  jaws  they  bear  him  away  through  the  thicket. 
Imbrius  then  th'  Aiantes  upholding  bore,  and  his  helmet         (2°i) 
Tore  from  his  head  and  his  glittering  armour  stripped.     Then  Oileus 
Wroth  for  Amphimachus  slain,  his  head  dissevered,  and  tossed  it 
High  o'er  the  the  crowd  and  it  fell,  in  the  dust  disfigured,  and  onward 
Rolled  like  a  ball  to  Hector's  feet,  all  bleeding  and  ghastly. 

Not  with  less  rage  was  Poseidon  rilled  at  the  fate  of  his  grandson, 
Thus  in  his  very  sight  struck  down  in  desperate  conflict. 
Once  more  among  the  tents  he  passed  and  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Cheering  the  Danaan  host  and  woes  for  the  Trojans  preparing. 
There   he    encountered    Idomeneus    bold,    who    had    quitted    the 

combat,  (2I°) 

Anxious  to  save  a  wounded  friend,  from  behind  at  the  knee-joint 
Pierced   by  a  spear,  whom  his  comrades  were  bearing  away  from 

the  battle. 
He  to  the  leeches'  care  had  consigned  him,  and  now  was  returning 
Back  to  his  tent,  for  he  longed  once  more  to  join  in  the  combat. 
Him  then  the  mighty  Poseidon  addressed,  in  voice  and  in  feature 
Lik'ning  himself  to  Thoas,  Andrsemon's  son,  who  o'er  Pleuron 


272 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XIII. 


Reigned,  and  ^Etolia's  realm,  and  Calydon's  rocky  recesses, 
Where,  as  a  God  respected  and  honoured,  the  people  obeyed  him : 

"Noble  Idomeneus  !    Creta's  sov'reign  !    How  have  they  vanished, 
All  those  threats  which  Achaia's  sons  once  hurled  at  the  Trojans  ?" 
Then  in  his  turn  responded  the  valiant  prince  of  the  Cretans  :    (221) 
"Thoas  !     Not  one  of  the  Greeks,  methinks,  deserves  thy  reproaches. 
All  are  familiar  with  arms.     Each  Greek  in  soul  is  a  warrior, 
None  is  by  heartless  fear  withheld.     No  Grecian  among  us 
Yields  himself  up  to  sloth  or  shrinks  from  the  labour  of  warfare. 
Zeus  himself  is  our  foe.     His  decrees  have  doomed  us  to  perish 
Nameless,  inglorious,  far  remote  from  our  home  and  our  country. 
Thee  have  I  ever  known  as  a  warrior  fearless  and  active, 
Thoas !     Exciting  the  laggard  alike  by  word  and  example. 
Go  then.    Each  man  thou  meefst  urge  on  to  fight  to  the  utmost."  (230) 

Thus  made  answer  in  turn  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon : 
"  Curst  be  the  wretch  this  day  who  lingers  and  shrinks  from  the  battle, 
Ne'er  may  he  live  to  return  from  the  shores  of  Troy  to  his  country ! 
Here  may  his  carcase  rot,  the  sport  of  dogs  and  of  vultures  / 
Come  then,  resume  thy  arms  and  return  with  me.     The  occasion 
All  our  haste  demands.     Though  but  two,  we  may  render  assistance. 
Even  the  feeble  united  are  strong  :  and  we  with  the  foremost 
Rank  where  deeds  of  arms  are  performed  and  the  valiant  are  gathered." 

Thus  having  said,  the  god  rushed  on  and  mixed  in  the  struggle, 
While  to  his  stately  tent  for  his  arms  Idomeneus  hastened.     (240) 
Soon  had  he  donned  his  glittering  arms,  two  lances  selecting. 
Then,  as  the  lightning  by  Zeus  displayed  from  the  heights  of  Olympus 
Brandished  aloft  in  his  red  right  hand  for  a  sign  unto  mortals 
Darts  forth  in  forked  gleams  of  unendurable  splendour — 
So,  as  the  hero  ran,  flashed  forth  bright  rays  from  his  corslet. 
Merion  first  he  encountered,  his  brave  and  faithful  attendant 
Close  by  the  tent  he  had  left,  who  came  to  provide  him  a  jav'lin. 
Meeting  him  thus  on  his  path,  the  Cretan  monarch  addressed  him  : 
"Swift-footed  Merion!  Molus'  son,  best  lov'd  of  my  comrades, 
Why  do  I  find  thee  here  deserting  thy  post  in  the  battle,       (250) 
Say  !  by  a  wound  from  some  hostile  lance  received  art  thou  suff'ring 
Or  peradventure,  a  message  bear'st  to  myself?     But  I  hasten 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  273 

Back  to  the  field,  for  my  soul  is  on  fire  to  join  in  the  combat." 
Bold  Meriones,  prudent  as  bold,  this  answer  returned  him : 
"Mighty  Idomeneus  !  sov'reign  at  once  and  guide  of  the  Cretans, 
'Tis  for  a  spear  I  come,  if  such  in  thy  tents  be  remaining. 
That  which  I  bore  to  the  fight  broke  short,  my  thrust  disappointing, 
Leaving  its  head  deep  fixed  in  fierce  Deiphobus'  buckler." 

Thus  making  answer  in  turn  replied  the  Prince  of  the  Cretans  : 
"Spears   thrice    sev'n   wilt   thou   find   in   my  tent.     Thence   choose 
as  thou  listest.  (260) 

Ranged  round  its  snowy  walls  they  stand.    All  Troiian  weapons, 
Ta'en  from  their  bearers  in  battle  slain.     For  not  from  a  distance 
Is  it  my  wont  to  fight.     I  strike  doum  my  foe  and  despoil  him. 
Thus  have  I  store  of  spears  and  bossy  shields  in  abundance, 
Many  a  casque,  and  many  a  breast-plate  polished  and  gleaming." 

Merion,  prudent  and  brave,  these  words  returned  him  in  answer : 
"Neither  within  my  tent  nor  the  darksome  hold  of  my  galley 
Lack  there  Troian  spoils  :  but  the  distance  is  far  to  procure  them. 
For,  though  L  say  it  myself,  no  want  of  spirit  or  courage 
Holds   me   back  from  the  glorious  fight.     There  I  stand  with  the 
foremost  (27°) 

Ever  prepared  for  war  when  the  moment  of  battle  approaches. 
What  though  among  the  Greeks  I  fight  unnoticed  by  others ; 
Not   so,   at   least,   by   thee.     /  have  fought  by  thy  side,   and   thou 
know'st  me." 

Thus  making  answer  in  turn  replied  the  Prince  of  the  Cretans : 
"Well  do  I  know  thy  valour.    What  needs  there  this  to  remind  me  ? 
Were  from  among  our  host,  for  an  ambush,  the  bravest  selected — ■ 
That  sharp  trial  which  tests  most  surely  the  soul  of  the  warrior ; 
Where  by  his  bearing  the  hero  stands  displayed  and  the  coward, — 
None  would  mistake  thy  conduct,  or  doubt  thy  strength  or  thy  valour : 
There  if  a  coward  be  placed,  his  colour  shifts,  and  alternate      (280) 
Varies  from  red  to  pale,  and  his  heart  is  troubled  within  him. 
Crouching,  on  both  his  heels  he  sits,  or  shifts  his  position. 
Then  too,  against  his  corslet  his  heart  beats  hard,  as  he  pictures 
Death's  approach,  and  his  chatt'ring  teeth  give  sign  of  his  terror. 
Not  so  the  brave.     His  colour  remains  unchanged  j  his  behaviour

Calm  and  composed,  when  he  sits  him  down  in  the  ambush  of  heroes. 

Only  he  prays  to  be  doing,  and  pants  for  the  moment  of  action. 

Thee  should  some  flying  shaft  attain,  or  thrust  of  a  jav'lin 

Stretch  thee,  o'erpow'red  in  the  dust,  no  wound  in  the  back  would 
disgrace  thee, 

Or  in  thy  nape  exposed.     On  thy  breast,  and   in   front   it   would 
strike  thee  (29°) 

Forward  pressing  and  leading  the  charge  with  the  first  of  thy  comrades. 

Cease  we  this  talk  however,  more  fit  for  children  than  warriors. 

Loitering,  bitterly  those  who  want  our  assistance  will  blame  us. 

Haste  then !     Run  to  my  tent  and  choose  the  best  of  my  lances." 
Merion,  as  Ares  brave,  obeyed  the  words  of  his  sov'reign, 

Ran  to  the  tent,  and  chose  forth  a  sharp  and  glittering  weapon, 

Following  then  on  Idomeneus'  steps  he  rushed  to  the  combat. 

Just  as  when  death-doing  Ares  himself  advances  to  battle 

Followed  by  Terror,  fearless  himself,  but  dreadful  to  mortals, 

Best    lov'd    son    of    the    God,   whom    the    bravest    shrinks    from 
beholding,  (3°°) 

Forth  out  of  Thrace  when  in  arms  they  come,  where  Ephyre's  warriors 
Fight  with  the  Phlegyans  bold,  by  both  invoked,  but  according 
Only  to  one  of  their  hosts,  the  prize  of  conquest  and  glory. 
Thus  these  chieftains,  heroes  themselves  and  leaders  of  heroes, 
Sheathed  in  refulgent  brass,  marched  on  to  the  scene  of  contention. 
Merion  now  resumed  the  discourse  a?id  Idomeneus  questioned  : 

"  Son  of  Deucalion  !  where  dost  thou  mean  to  enter  the  battle  ? 
Or  on  the  right,  the  center,  or  left  ?     To  the  left,  as  it  seems  me, 
Sorest  the  Greeks  are  pressed,  and  most  they  need  our  assistance. 
This  is  the  place,  and  now  the  time,  to  make  our  decision"         (310) 

Thus  making  answer,  in  turn  replied  the  Prince  of  the  Cretans  : 
"There  at  our  central  ships  they  need  us  not,  they  have  others. 
Both  Aiantes  are  there.     There  Teucer  fights ;   as  an  archer 
First  of  th'  Achaian  host,  and  in  close,  stem  combat  excelling. 
Hector,  the  son  of  Priam,  may  rage  as  he  will  with  his  Trojans, 
These  will  afford  him  fighting  enough,  be  he  ever  so  valiant, 
Ever  so  greedy  of  battle  and  war :    full  hard  will  he  find  it, 
Strength  such  as  theirs  to  shake,  and  subdue  their  invincible  firmness,

This  must  he  do,  ere  he  burn  our  ships,  should  Zeus  not  assist  him, 
Showering  downyh?///  the  skies,  his  fiery  bolts  to  consume  them.      (320) 
Nor  does  the  man  exist,  sustained  by  the  fruits  of  Demeter, 
Whom  either  weapon  can  wound,  or  rocks  can  crush,  who  could  conquer. 
Aye!   or  stir  from  his  post,  the  great  Telamonian  Aias. 
Not  from  the  mighty  Achilles  himself  would  he  flinch  in  the  combat, 
Closely  encountered,  hand  to  hand;  though  inferior  in  swiftness. 
Hold  then  thy  course  for  the  left.     There  fate  will  soonest  determine 
Whether  the  victor's  meed  we  shall  win,  or  confer  it  on  others." 

Merion,  as  Ares  brave,  obeyed  the  command  of  his  sov'reign, 
Striking  across,  by  the  path  which  he  pointed  out,  to  the  army. 
Now,  when  the  foe  beheld  them  approaching  in  glittering  armour,  (330) 
Brave  Idomeneus  first,  like  a  flame,  and  his  valiant  attendant, 
One  on  another  they  called,  and  in  crowds  came  rushing  upon  them. 
Fierce  was  the  combat  now  that  raged  round  the  prows  of  the  gallies. 
As  when  in  eddying  blasts  the  shrill-voiced  winds  are  contending, 
What  time  the  ground  is  parched,  and  the  dust  lies  thick  on  the  path- 
ways, 
Whirled  up  aloft  in  clouds,  it  rises  and  darkens  the  region: 
Thus  waxed  fiercer  and  thicker  the  fight.     Each  warrior  among  them, 
Reckless  of  wounds  himself,  sought  only  to  slay  his  opponent. 
Horrent  and  bristling  with  spears,  were  the  close-prest  lines  of  the 

battle 
Long,    flesh-rending.     The    brazen    gleams   that   blazed   from    their 
helmets,  (34°) 

Flashed  from  their  freshly  polished  shields,  and  glittering  corslets, 
Dazzled  the  sight.     Right  stern  were  the  heart  that  with  joy  could 

behold  them 
Lab'ring  in  that  dread  work  ;  nor  feel  some  movement  of  horror. 

Such  were  the  toils  and  woes  which  the  sons  of  mysterious  Kronos, 
Each  in  his  might,  adopting  opposing  sides  in  their  quarrel, 
Heaped  on  th'  heroic  chiefs  in  that  wild  struggle  contending. 
Zeus,  on  his  part,  remembering  his  promise  to  honour  Achilles, 
Hector  and  Troy  had  agreed  to  support,  and  lead  them  to  conquest. 
(Not  that  he  meant  to  destroy  the  Greeks,  or  Ilion  to  rescue; 
Thetis  howbeit  above  all,  and  her  valiant  son,  he  regarded,)  (35°)

276  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

While,  from  the  hoary  deep,  unobserved  emerging,  Poseidon, 
Mixed  with  the  Greeks,  and  their  hearts  sustained ;  for  he  grieved  to 

behold  them 
Crushed  and  subdued  by  Troy  :  and  at  Zeus  his  soul  was  indignant. 
Equal  their  lineage,  one  their  race  :  but  Zeus  was  the  elder, 
First  in  right  of  his  birth,  and  first  as  excelling  in  wisdom. 
Therefore,  in  semblance  a  man,  through  the  Grecian  army  Poseidon 
Passed  unperceived,  nor  dared  to  appear  revealed  in  his  Godhead. 
Thus  was  the  direful  issue  of  war,  and  unyielding  contention 
Forced  on  the  hosts,  and  a  strong  compulsion,  stern  and  relentless, 
Chained  them  together,  in  mutual  hate,  in  mutual  slaughter.         (360) 
Then  did  Idomeneus,  grey  albeit,  with  years  and  with  hardships ; 
Cheer  on  the  Greeks  and,  springing  upon  them,  scatter  the  Trojans  : 
First  by  his  hand  Othryoneus  fell,  who  to  Troy  from  Cabesus 
Came,  ere  its  siege  had  been  long  declared,  for  love  of  Cassandra, 
Whom  from  her  father  Priam  he  sought,  though  dow'rless,  in  wedlock  ; 
Dow'rless  in  all  but  beauty.     And  much  he  vaunted  his  prowess, 
Promising  speedy  deliv'rance  to  Troy  from  the  sons  of  Achaia. 
Priam  agreed.     His  consent  he  pledged,  and  his  daughter  he  promised, 
And  on  his  promise  relying,  the  chief  marched  boldly  to  battle, 
Striding  abroad  in  defiant  guise,  but  his  ponderous  jav'lin       (370) 
Full  at  his  front  Idomeneus  aimed :   nor  resisted  his  corslet, 
Strongly  compact  with  brass ;  but  the  spear  stood  fixed  in  his  navel, 
Down  he  fell  with  a  crash.     Then  thus  exulted  the  victor : 
"  Valiant  Othryoneus  !  great  will  be  now  thy  renown  among  mortals, 
Shouldst  thou  indeed  redeem  that  pledge  thou  gavest  to  Priam, 
When,  in  return  for  thine  aid,  as  thy  bride  his  daughter  he  promised. 
We  too  have  somewhat  to  promise.     Change  sides  :  and  then  will  we 

give  thee 
Royal  Atreides'  fairest  daughter.     Hither  from  Argos 
Shall  she  in  triumph  be  led,  to  wed  thee.     Only  assist  us, 
Lending  the  force  of  thy  mighty  arm,  proud  Ilion  to  conquer.    (380) 
Come  then  !  seek  we  our  ships,  and  there  the  terms  of  thy  marriage 
Let  us  arrange.     No  doubt  thou  wilt  not  despise  our  alliance." 
Thus  having  said,  through  the  press  by  the  foot  Idomeneus  dragged 

him. 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  277 

Asius  beheld,  and  at  once  stepped  forth  resolved  to  avenge  him, 
Fighting  on  foot ;  while  behind,  at  his  shoulders,  the  breath  of  his 

coursers 
Played,  by  his  charioteer  kept  close  on  his  steps;  at  the  victor 
Just  preparing  to  thrust ;   but  he,  more  ready  and  watchful, 
Smote  him  below  the  chin,  in  his  throat.     Right  through  went  the 

weapon. 
Down  sank  the  chief  as  sinks  some  oak,  or  wide-spreading  poplar, 
Or  as  some  stately  pine  on  the  mountains  felled,  which  the  shipwright 
Hews  with  fresh-whetted  axe,  to  shape  some  beam  for  his  vessel. (391) 
Thus  lay  the  hero,  prostrate  before  his  steeds  and  his  chariot, 
Gnashing  his  teeth,  and  clutching  the  bloody  dust  in  his  death-pang. 
Struck  was  his  charioteer  with  benumbing  fear,  which  deprived  him 
Ev'n  of  the  power  of  thought :  nor  dared  he  turn  and  his  coursers 
Save  from  the  enemy's  hands.     Then  brave  Antilochus,  aiming 
Full  at  his  front,  his  spear  dismissed;  nor  resisted  his  corslet, 
Strong-compacted  with  brass :  but  the  spear  stood  fixed  in  his  stomach. 
Groaning  he  fell  from  the  beauteous  car,  which  Antilochus  mounting, 
Nestor's  heroic  son,  from  amid  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans  (400) 

Drove  off  in  triumph,  and  mixed  with  the  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia. 

Up  came  Deiphobus,  burning  with  rage  at  the  slaughter  of  Asius, 
Close  to  Idomeneus  stood,  and  dismissed  his  glittering  jav'lin. 
Watchful,  the  prince  the  act  beheld,  and  eluded  the  weapon 
Crouching,  and  lifting  oblique  the  smooth  round  orb  of  his  buckler 
Formed  of  the  tough  bull-hide  and  of  polish'd  brass,  while  within  it 
Two  strong  bars  its  grasp  secured,  and  strengthened  its  fabric. 
Over  it  glanced  the  brazen  spear,  and  grazing  across  it 
Gave  forth  a  harsh  dry  sound;  but  retaified  its  force  as  it  bounded 
Off,  and  it  flew  not  in  vain  from  the  pow'rful  hand  of  its  master.  (410) 
Hippasus'  son,  Hypsenor,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Under  the  waist  through  the  liver  it  pierced,  and  he  fell  in  his  death- 
pang. 
Thus  then  in  loud  and  terrific  strain  Deiphobus  shouted  : 

"Not  unavenged  hath  Asius  fall'n.    Methinks  that  his  spirit 
"Wending  its  dozunwa?'d  path  through  the  massive  portals  of  Hades 
Somewhat  of  joy  will  feel,  to  think  what  a  guide  I  have  sent  him." 


278  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

Thus  did  he  boast.     But  his  taunts  were  as  stings  to  the  hearts  of 
the  Grecians; 
Deepest  of  all  was  the  gen'rous  soul  of  Antilochus  wounded. 
Yet  in  his  wrath  did  he  not  forget  to  protect  his  companion 
Fall'n;  but  around  him  stalked,  and  o'er  him  his  buckler  extended.  (420) 
Raising  him  then  from  the  ground  his  dear  and  faithful  companions, 
Echius'  valiant  son  Mecisteus  and  noble  Alastor 
Bore  him  with  many  a  sigh  to  the  hollow  ships  of  the  Grecians. 

Nor  did  Idomeneus  yet  shrink  back,  or  relax  in  his  efforts  ; 
Ever  his  soul  was  yearning  to  wrap  some  Trojan  in  darkness, 
Or  with  a  mighty  ruin  himself  to  fall  for  his  country. 
Such  was  his  mood  when  Alcathous  he  met,  who  boasted  a  lineage 
All  but  divine,  from  great  ^Esyetas.     He  from  Anchises 
Sought  and  obtained  his  eldest  and  fairest  daughter  in  marriage, 
Hippodameia,  the  cherish'd  at  heart  of  her  father  and  mother,     (430) 
Light  of  their  home;  who  her  young  compeers  in  mind,  as  in  beauty, 
Far  surpassed,  and  in  ev'ry  female  work  and  adornment; 
Happy  in  winning  the  noblest  youth  in  Troy  for  a  husband, 
Him  to  Idomeneus'  spear  an  easy  conquest  Poseidon 
Gave;  obscuring  his  sight  and  loos'ning  the  bands  of  his  sinews, 
Nor  could  he  fly  nor  turn  him  aside,   but  dazed  and  bewildered 
Stood,  like  some  column  or  lofty  tree,  awaiting  his  foeman 
Fixt,  unresisting.     Full  in  the  breast  Idomeneus  smote  him, 
Hurling  his  spear,  which  shattered  the  brazen  strength  of  his  corslet, 
Tearing  the  stiff  defence  which  so  oft  had  saved  him  in  battle.     (440) 
Broken,  it  gave  forth  a  crackling  sound  and  admitted  the  weapon; 
Crashing  he  fell:  and  fixt  in  his  heart  the  spear  to  its  handle 
Quivered,  through  all  its  length,  to  the  strong  rebound  of  its  pulses. 
There  was  the  force  of  the  jav'lin  stayed  and  its  fury  expended. 
Thus  then,  in  loud  and  terrific  strain  Idomeneus  shouted : 

"Tell  me,  Deiphobus:  must  we  not  call  it  a  handsome  requital, 
Three  to  be  slain  for  one  ?  since  such  is  the  style  of  thy  boasting. 
Wretch!     Wilt   thou   match   thy  force   with   mine,  and  meet  me  in 

combat? 
Soon  shalt  thou  learn  what  the  offspring  of  Zeus  in  fight  can  accomplish. 
Hither  as  such  I  come.     For  Minos,  sov'reign  of  Creta,  (45°) 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  279 

Zeus  for  his  father  boasted.    Then  next  Deucalion,  the  blameless, 
Minos  begat;  myself  Deucalion.     In  Creta's  dominion 
Many  are  those  who  own  my  sway.     From  Crete  in  my  vessels 
Troy-ward  I  sailed,  to  thyself  a  scourge,  to  thy  father  and  nation." 

Thus  he  spake.     But  Deiphobus  doubtful  stood;  undecided 
Whether,  retiring  aw/ii/eht  should  choose  some  friend  from  the  Trojans, 
Valiant  ever  in  fight,  or  alone  attempt  the  adventure. 
Soon  he  resolved  on  his  course.     Far  wiser  he  deemed  it  and  better 
Brave  ^Eneas  to  seek.     In  the  rear  of  the  Trojans  he  found  him 
Stationed,  holding  aloof,  for  he  bore  some  grudge  against  Priam,  (460) 
Who,  with  disdainful  neglect  o'erlooked  his  prowess,  and  wisdom. 
Taking  his  stand  the  prince  beside,  then  thus  he  addressed  him: 
' Noble  ^Eneas!  Guardian  of  Troy  in  war  and  in  council, 
Up!  and  avenge  thy  sister's  wedded  lord,  if  thou  lov'dst  him. 
Follow  me.     Rescue  Alcathous  slain  who  watched  o'er  thy  boyhood 
In  thy  ancestral  halls,  by  ties  of  domestic  affection 
Bound.     From  mighty  Idomeneus  took  he  his  death  wound." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  hero's  heart  was  stirred  in  his  bosom. 
Seeking  Idomeneus,  van-ward  he  strode,  on  fire  to  confront  him. 
Nor  did  Idomeneus  shrink,  or  child-like  shun  the  encounter;        (470) 
Firm  he  stood,  like  some  huge  mountain  boar  who  confiding 
Stands  in  his  might,  and  awaits  th'  advancing  din  of  the  hunters, 
Deep  in  some  desolate  pass.     Up  bristles  his  back  with  excitement, 
Fierce  glows  the  fire  in  his  eyes,  and  he  whets  his  tusks  in  his  fury, 
Ready  to  rend  both  dogs  and  men  who  shall  dare  to  attack  him. 
Thus,  collected,  the  Cretan  stood,  nor  thought  of  retreating, 
While  with  a  shout  ^Eneas  advanced.     But  he  called  on  his  comrades 
All  within  sight:  Ascalaphus  brave,  Deipyrus,  Merion, 
Mighty  Antilochus,  Apaneus  too;  all  chiefs  of  distinction;        (479) 
Claiming  their  aid :  and  thus  with  urgent  appeal  he  addressed  them : 

"Hither,  my  friends!     Support  me!     I  stand  alone,  and  .^Eneas 
Rushes  upon  me.     I  dread  his  assault,  since  ardent  and  active, 
In  the  full  flow'r  of  his  youth  and  strength  he  comes,  and  accustomed 
Heroes  to  meet  opposed  in  arms,  and  to  slay  them  in  battle. 
Had  I  but  youth  like  his  to  second  the  spirit  within  me, 
Great  should  our  combat's  glory  be  to  the  one  or  the  other." 


280  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

Thus  he  spake:  and  the  heroes  all  collected  around  him, 
All  in  one  mind,  close-locked,  with  their  bucklers  sloped  to  their  shoulders. 
This  perceiving,  ^Eneas  on  his  part  called  for  assistance, 
Paris,  Deiphobus,  round  him  pressed,  and  noble  Agenor,         (490) 
Leaders  of  TrOy.     And  the  troops  when  they  heard  the  summons 

came  rushing, 
Num'rous  as  sheep  which  follow  the  lead  of  the  ram,  in  the  meadows, 
Flocking  to  drink  at  a  pool,  while  the  heart  of  the  shepherd  rejoices. 
Thus  rejoiced  in  his  bosom  the  heart  of  ^Eneas,  beholding, 
Gath'ring  behind  himself  and  his  friends,  the  host  of  the  Trojans. 
Then  round  Alcathoiis  rose  a  close  and  desperate  conflict, 
Spear  crossing  spear :  then  fearfully  rang  the  bronze  of  the  breastplates 
Under  the  fast  and  furious  thrusts  by  each  at  the  other 
Aimed   through  the  thick  of  the  fray:  where   the   two  redoubtable 

chieftains, 
Brave  ^Eneas,  and  godlike  Idomeneus,  valiant  as  Ares,  (50°) 

Each  came  seeking  the  other's  life,  and  burned  to  destroy  him. 
First  at  the  Cretan  prince  was  hurled  the  spear  of  ^Eneas. 
Deftly  shifting  Ais  ground  he  avoided  the  blow;  and  the  weapon 
Held  on  its  course,  and  deep  in  the  ground  stood  rooted  and  quiv'ring, 
Sent  on  a  bootless  quest  from  the  mighty  hand  of  its  master. 
Then,  by  Idomeneus'  spear  through  the  midriff  pierced,  JEnomaiis 
Sank.     Through  the  swelling  brass  beneath  his  girdle  it  entered. 
Grasping  the  dust  he  fell  and  his  entrails  gushed  from  the  death-wound. 
Forth  from  the  Corse  the  victor  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin    (509) 
Plucked ;  but  to  strip  from   his   shoulders  his  beauteous  arms  and 

despoil  him, 
Time,  nor  his  strength  sufficed.    Hemmed  in  by  weapons  on  all  sides, 
Feeling  no  more  in  his  feet  their  accustomed  spring,  when  he  darted 
Forward  his  spear  to  recover,  or  leaped  aside  from  hisfoeman's; 
Still   though  in  standing   fight   he   was   firm,   and  kept  death  at  a 

distance, 
Hardly  they  bore  him  with  slow  and  weary  steps  from  the  battle. 
Him  thus  slowly  retiring  from  fight  Deiphobus  marking 
After  him  sent  a  parting  spear,  for  he  hated  him  ever. 
Wide  of  its  mark  the  weapon  flew,  but  Ascalaphus  wounded, 


Book  XIII.]

Through 


the   shoulder  it 


of  the  God  who 

pierced  him, 
Issuing  behind.    Down  sank  he,  and  clutched  the  ground  where  he 

grovelled.  (520) 

Nor  did  the  furious  God  know  aught  of  the  death  of  his  offspring, 
Sitting  aloof,  so  Zeus  had  decreed,  on  the  heights  of  Olympus, 
Canopied  o'er  with  golden  clouds,  where  the  Gods  were  assembled, 
All,  by  the  dread  command  of  their  sire,  withheld  from  the  battle : 
Thus  saw  he  nought,  nor  knew  of  his  fall  in  that  desperate  struggle. 

Now  round  Ascalaphus  rose  a  fierce  and  terrible  combat. 
From  the  dead  hero  Deiphobus  snatched  his  glittering  helmet : 
Merion  however,  prompt  as  Ares,  and  brave  as  the  war-god, 
Springing  upon  him,  pierced  his  arm.     Then  dropped  he  the  helmet. 
Loud  was  the  ring  of  the  crested  casque,  as  from  earth  it  rebounded. 
Pouncing  upon  him,  vulture-like,  to  7'ecover  his  weapon,  (53 1) 

Merion  tore  forth  the  lance  from  his  wounded  arm,  and  retiring 
Mingled  again  with  the  host  of  his  friends.     Forth  started  Polites, 
Grasped  round  the  waist  his  brother,  and  bore  him  forth  from  the 

combat, 
Out  of  the  press,  to  the  rear,  where  his  coursers  stood,  to  his  chariot 
Beauteous  and  rich  to  behold  by  their  driver  bound,  and  awaiting 
Only  their  master's  need  to  bear  him  away  from  the  battle. 
These  to  the  city  Deiphobus  bore,  all  bitterly  groaning, 
Fainting  with  pain,  while  the  blood  poured  fast  from  the  wound  in 

his  elbow. 
Meantime   the    fight   went   on,    and   its   roar  waxed   louder  and 

fiercer.  (54°) 

Aphaneus  first,  Caletor's  son,  as  he  turned  to  confront  him, 
Full  in  the  throat  ^Eneas  smote,  and  the  head  of  the  hero 
Sideways  dropped,  by  his  helmet's  weight  opprest,  and  his  buckler 
Weighed  him  down,  and  the  shadows  of  death  came   floating  around 

him. 
Next  upon  Thoon  Antilochus  sprang,  who  had  turned  to  avoid  him 
Ent'ring  his  back  obliquely  the  spear  drove  on,  in  its  passage 
Rending  away  the  flesh  and  all  the  veins  which  along  it 
Hold  their  course  to  the  neck;  and  supine  he  fell;  and  extended

On  rushed  Antilochus,  seizing  his  arms,  which  he  stripped  from  his 

shoulders,  (55°) 

Warily  looking  around  him  the  while.   For  about  him  on  all  sides 
Pressed  the  Trojans,  bristling  his  shield  with  many  a  jav'lin: 
All  in  vain.     Not  a  spear  might  graze  but  the  skin  of  the  hero 
Safe  in  its  cover.     Mighty  Poseidon  protected  his  fav'rite, 
Nestor's  offspring,  and  kept  him  secure  in  the  midst  of  the  weapons. 
All  who  came  on  he  faced,  nor  shrank  from  his  foes,  and  he  held 

them, 
Turning  from  one  to  another,  at  bay;  while  his  jav'lin  he  brandished 
Now,  as  in  act  to  hurl  it,  and  now,  as  watching  the  moment 
Forward  to  rush,  and  thrust  it  home  to  the  hearts  ^/"his  foemen. 
Adamas,  Asias'  son,  when  uncertain  thus  he  beheld  him  (560) 

Rushing  upon  him  close,  with  his  lance,  in  the  midst  of  his  buckler, 
Struck   him  a   sharp   strong   blow:  but  the  dark-haired  lord  of  the 

ocean, 
Grudging  so  precious  a  life,  enfeebled  the  force  of  the  weapon. 
Part  remained  fixed   in   the   shield,    like   a   half-burnt   stake.     The 

remainder, 
Splintered,  flew  from   his  grasp,  and  strewed   the   ground   with   its 

fragments : 
Baffled,  the  warrior  withdrew  to  his  comrades,  shunning  destruction. 
Merion  then  aimed  his  spear  at  the  flying  chief;  and  it  struck  him 
Deep  in  the  belly's  rim,  betwixt  the  groin  and  the  navel; 
Just  where  to  surT'ring  mortals  the  pang  of  a  wound  is  the  keenest; 
There  stood  the  spear  infixed :  and  he  struggled  and  writhed  in  his 

torment.  (57°) 

As  when  an  ox,  which  herdsmen   have   bound   with   cords  in  the 

mountains, 
Writhes  in  his  bonds,  while  they  drag  him  along  in  spite  of  his  struggles, 
Thus  for  a  while  he  writhed. — Not  long — till  Merion  approaching 
Plucked  from  the  wound  and  recovered  his  spear.     He  fell,  and  his  life 

blood 
Ebbed  away,  and  the  darkness  of  death   o'ershadowed  his  eyeballs. 
Helenus  next  with  Deipyrus  closing,  full  on  his  temple 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  283 

Dealt  with  his  mighty  Thracian  sword  a  blow;   and  the  helmet 
Struck  from  his  head.     On  the  ground  in  the  dust  it  rolled,  and  a 

Grecian 
Raised  it  and  bore  it  off  from  amid  the  feet  of  the  warriors : 
Down  he  sank,  and  night  in  her  ghastly  shadow  involved  him.    (580) 
Grief  then  seized  on  the  soul  of  Atreus'  son,  Menelaiis. 
Down  on  King  Helenus  threat'ning  he  came  and  a  jav'lin  he  brandished 
Pointed  and  keen,  while  the  Trojan  adjusted  a  shaft  to  his  bowstring  : 
Thus  together  they  came  :   this  eager  to  wound  with  his  jav'lin, 
That  in  his  foematis  heart  to  plant,  from  his  bowstring,  an  arrow. 
Forth  sprang  the  shaft  of  the  Trojan  prince,  and  it  rang  on  the  breast- 
plate 
Convex  and  smooth,  but  bounded  off  and  left  him  uninjured ; 
As  from  the  fan  tossed  forth  on  the  spacious  floor  of  the  thresher 
Lightly  rebound  the  vetches  and  dark-skinned  beans,  as  they  leap  forth 
Driv'n  by  the  shrill-voiced  blast  and  the  sturdy  winnower's  impulse : 
Thus  from  the  corslet  repelled  of  that  glorious  chief  Menelaiis    (591) 
Far  rebounded,  blunted  and  baffled,  the  shaft  of  the  Trojan. 
Then  Menelaiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  his  weapon 
Hurled,  and  it  struck  the  hand  which  the  bow  supported,  and  nailed  it 
Fast  to  the  polished  wood,  pierced  through.     Then  retreated  the  hero, 
Mingling  among  the  host  of  his  friends,  and  avoided  destruction, 
Trailing  the  ashen  spear  from  his  wounded  hand,  which  disabled 
Hung  at  his  side.     But  Agenor  came,  and,  extracting  the  weapon, 
Bound  up  the  hand  in  a  sling  of  twisted  wool,  by  a  servant 
Handed  him,  eager  to  aid  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people.  (600) 

Now  came  Peisander  in  full  career,  against  brave  Menelaiis 
Rushing,  whose  adverse  fate  had  marked  him  for  death  and  destruction, 
Thee,  Menelaiis  !  to  grace  with  his  fall,  in  the  struggle  of  heroes. 
Thus  as  they  neared  each  other,  when  now  small  space  was  between 

them, 
First  Menelaiis  his  pointed  lance  dismissed :   but  it  wandered 
Wide  of  its  mark.     Peisander  next  on  the  shield  of  Atreides 
Smote,  with  a  sharp,  full  blow;  but  to  pierce  it  availed  not.  The  weapon 
From  the  wide   orb  recoiled,  and  the  blade   broke  short  from   the 
socket. 


284  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

Nor  did  he  less  exult,  nor  in  aught  was  his  confidence  lessened, 
Ev'n  when  Atreides  his  sword  drew  forth  all  studded  with  silver   (610) 
And  at  Peisander  sprang.     He,  no  whit  daunted,  a  pole-axe 
Drew  from  beneath  his  shield.     Of  bronze  was  its  blade,  and  the  handle 
Long ;   smooth  olive  the  wood.     At  once  each  struck  at  the  other. 
From  Menelaiis'  helmet  the  ridge  was  shorn,  where  the  horse-tail 
Rises  aloft  to  a  plume  :   but  across  the  front  of  Peisander 
Just  at  the  spring  of  the  nose  fell  the  sword.     The  bones  it  divided  : 
Down  rolled  his  bleeding  eyes  in  the  dust  at  his  feet,  and  he  writhed 

him 
Falling.     Then  Menelaiis  the  corse  despoiled,  on  the  bosom 
Planting  his  heel,  and  exultingly  thus  loud  boasted  the  victor  : 

"So  may  ye  all  relinquish  your  hold  on  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Insolent,  overreaching  race,  insatiate  of  slaughter,  (621) 

Where  is  the  outrage  and  wrong  which  ye  have  not  wrought  ?     What 

scandal 
Brought  not  on  me  and  my  house  ?     Vile  hounds  !     Nor  the  dread 

retribution 
Fear  ye,  which   thundering   Zeus,    the   guardian   of  homes   and   of 

friendships, 
Threatens,  and  yet  will  accomplish,  and  lay  your  city  in  ruins. 
Honoured  and  welcomed  ye  came,  but  in  traifrous  guise  ye  departed, 
Bearing  away  from  her  home  my  fair  young  wife  and  my  treasures. 
Now,  to  complete  your  crimeye.  would  burn  the  ships  which  should  bear  us 
Homeward ;   hurling  destructive  brands,  and  slaying  our  heroes. 
Soon  shall  your  rage  be  subdued,   and  a  terrible  lesson  be  taught 

you.  (630) 

Father  Zeus  !  supreme  as  we  hold  thee  in  wisdom  and  justice, 
High  above  Gods  and  men.     Such  deeds  as  these  dost  thou  sanction  ? 
Canst  thou  abet  in  their  guilt  these  insolent  Trojans,  and  bid  them 
Joy  in  their  course  of  fraud  and  crimes,  implacable  ever 
In  their  unbridled  rage,  and  yearning  for  war  and  destruction? 
Sleep,  the  delights  of  love,  the  charms  of  song,  and  the  graceful 
Dance — all  better  than  war — all  far  more  pleasing  to  mortals, 
Yet  find  a  limit  in  man's  desires.     To  none  but  the  Trojans 
War  and  its  horrors  afford  an  uncloying  feast  of  enjoyment." 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILTAI&gt;  OF  HOMER.  285 

Thus  spake  the  brave  and  blameless  chief.     From  his  vanquished 

opponent  (640) 

Stripping  the  blood-stain'd  spoils,  to  his  comrades'  charge  he  consigned 

them  : 
Then  to  the  front  advancing  he  mixed  once  more  in  the  combat. 
Forth,  to  confront  him,  Harpalion  sprang  :   the  son  of  a  sov'reign, 
King  Pylaemenes.     He  to  the  wars  had  followed  his  father; 
Troy  he  reached ;  but  his  country  no  more  was  doomed  to  revisit. 
Close  approaching,  his  spear  he  hurled,  and  the  shield  of  Atreides 
Smote  :  but  in  vain,  for  the  brazen  point  availed  not  to  pierce  it, 
Back  to  the  ranks  of  his  friends  he  fled,  destruction  avoiding, 
Looking  around  him  the  while,   lest  a  spear  should  reach  him  re- 
treating. 
Merion  perceived,  and  a  dart  from  his  bow  he  sped,  and  it  struck 
him  (650) 

On  the  right  hip  from  behind.     The  shaft  passed  onward,  and  gliding 
Down,  'twixt  the   bone    and  the  bladder   its    course   pursued :    and 

arrested, 
Down  on  the  spot  he  sank,  in  the  arms  of  his  friends  and  companions 
Breathing  his  last ;  like  a  worm  in  the  dust  extended  and  grov'ling  ■ 
While  bedewing  the  ground,  his  dark  blood  poured  in  a  torrent. 
Round  him,  with  pious  care,  his  brave  Paphlagonians  gathered  ■ 
Raised,  and  laid  on  a  chariot  his  sad  remains,  and  to  Ilion 
Bore  him  in  mournful  array.     In  tears  his  father  attended  : 
Nor  could  those  tears  avail  to  avenge  the  death  of  his  offspring. 

Grieving  and  angered,  Paris  beheld  his  fall.     In  his  travels      (660) 
Long  had  he  dwelt  as  a  guest  with  the  Paphlagonian  warriors. 
Thirsting  for  vengeance,  a  rajidom  shaft  at  the  Greeks  he  directed. 
One  of  the  foremost,  Euchsemon,  a  chief  both  wealthy  and  valiant, 
Son  of  the  seer  Polyeidus,  in  Corinth  who  dwelt,  had  to  Troia 
Come,  well  knowing  his  fate,  with  the  Grecian  fleet :  for  his  father 
Oft  had  foretold — the  good  old  man — that  home  in  his  palace 
Death  he  would  meet  in  ling'ring  and  painful  disease  ;  or  in  battle 
Fall,  in  defence  of  the  Grecian  ships,  by  the  hands  of  the  Trojans. 
This  he  preferred.     Far  better  he  deemed  it  to  die  for  his  country, 
Far  less  grievous  to  bear,  than  disease  and  disgrace  to  encounter.    (670) 


286  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIII. 

Pierced  through  the  cheeks  and  the  ear  he  fell ;  and  the  strength  from 

his  members 
Fled,  with  his  life  :  and  the  shades  of  eternal  darkness  involved  him. 

Thus,  like  a  raging  fire,  still  faster  and  fiercer,  the  combat 
Raged,  to  the  left  of  the  ships.     Yet  came  no  tidings  to  Hector, 
How   in   that  quarter  the  Greeks   prevailed;    and   would   soon   be 

victorious. 
Such  and  so  mighty  the  spirit  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon, 
Breathed  through  the  Argive  host,  and  such  the  strength  that  he  gave 

them. 
He,  at  the  self-same  place  where  he  burst  the  gate,  and  where  sw  aiming, 
O'er  the  demolished  wall  came  pouring  the  host  of  the  Trojans, 
Still  persisted  in  furious  efforts  to  break  through  the  Grecians,      (680) 
Joining  their  shields ;  where  the  ships  of  Aias  and  Protesilaiis, 
High  on  the  shore  of  the  hoary  sea  were  drawn ;  where  the  rampart 
Lowest  was  built ;   where  space  was  left  in  front  of  the  vessels, 
Horses  and  men  to  muster,  in  fierce  and  determined  resistance. 
There  the  Boeotians  fought,  and  there  the  long-mantled  Iones, 
There  too  the  Phthian  and  Locrian  hosts,  and  the  valiant  Epeians 
Kept  the  assault  of  Hector  at  bay,  and  protected  the  vessels. 
More  could  they  not.     Like  the  blaze  of  devouring  fire  was  his  onset. 
First  were  the  chosen  Athenian  bands,  and  among  them  Menestheus, 
Peteus'  son,  commanded;   and  Pheidas,  Stichius,  Bias  (690) 

Lent  him  their  stro?ig  support.     Next  Meges,  Phyleus'  offspring, 
Headed  th'  Epeian  force,  with  Drakeios  bold,  and  Amphion  ; 
Then  came  the  Phthians,  led  by  Medon  and  mighty  Podarces, 
(Medon  indeed,  the  spurious  son  of  godlike  Oileus, 
Brother  of  Aias  himself,  at  Phylace  dwelt,  from  his  country 
Far,  having  slain  a  chief,  the  brother  of  fair  Eriopis, 
Whom,  as  his  lawful  bride,  his  father  Oileus  had  wedded  ; 
While,  from  Iphiclus  sprung  and  in  Phylace  born,  was  Podarces); 
These  led  the  Phthian  force,  and  among  the  Boeotian  warriors 
Took  their  place  in  the  line,  and  stoutly  defended  the  vessels.     (700) 

Aias  the  swift,  Oileus'  son,  through  the  stress  of  the  combat 
Not  for  a  moment  quitted  the  great  Telamonian  hero. 
Just  as  when  two  black  bulls,  through  the  stubborn  soil  of  a  fallow, 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  287 

Labour  with  one  accord  to  drag  the  plough.     Down  their  foreheads 
Pours,  from  the  roots   of  their  horns  outbreaking,  the  sweat  :    and 

together, 
Close  to  the  smooth-worn  yoke,  they  press;  and  each  on  the  other 
Leans,  as  the  furrow  they  tread,  and  heave  up  the  soil  with  the  plough- 
share. 
Thus  they  toiled  on,  and  side  by  side  supported  each  other. 
Many  and  brave  were  the  troops  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias, 
FolFwing  where'er  he  led,  and  bearing  his  ponderous  buckler,      (710) 
When  by  fatigue  o'erpower'd,  he  sought  relief  from  its  burthen. 
Xot  so  the  Locrians  followed  the  valiant  son  of  Oileus. 
Hand  to  hand  they  fought  not,  nor  ventured  to  close   with   their 

foemen ; 
Helmets  of  brazen  proof,  horse-tailed  and  glancing  they  wore  not. 
On  the  tough  ashen  spear  and  the  buckler's  orb  they  relied  not. 
Armed  but  with  arrows  and  bows,  and  the  wool-twined  cord  of  the 

slinger, 
Came  they  to  Ilion's  shore.     With  these,  on  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
Hurled    they   destruction    frequent    and    fast,    and    scattered   their 

squadrons. 
These  in  close-serried  lines,  and  in  bright  and  various  armour, 
Fought    upon    equal    terms ;    with    the    bronze-mailed    Trojans    and 

Hector.  (/2°) 

Those,    from    the    rear,    concealed    from    view,    with    their    thick- 
falling  missiles 
Daunted  the  Trojan  host  and  spread  confusion  among  them. 

Now  from  the  tents  and  ships,  with  loss  and  defeat,  had  the  Trojans 
Back  been  forced  to  retreat  to  their  wind-swept  Ilian  city 
Had  not  Polydamas  Hector  the  brave  approached,  and  addressed  him: 
"Hector!     Thy  spirit  is  ever  averse  from  counsel  and  guidance. 
W  nat,  though   the    Gods   above   all  with  prowess  and  valour  have 

graced  thee, 
Wouldst  thou  be  held  alike  supreme  in  wisdom  and  prudence? 
'Tis  not  for  mortal  man  to  be  first  and  greatest  in  all  things. 
Glory  to  one,  and  martial  exploits  by  the  Gods  are  accorded;  (730) 
One  man  excels  in  the  dance ;  in  the  song  and  in  harping  another ; 


288 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XIII. 


While  in  the  breasts  of  a  few,  all-seeing  Zeus  hath  implanted 
Wisdom  and  forethought,  priceless  gifts,  for  the  good  of  the  many. 
Such   are   the   saviours    of    states.       They   know,   and  they  feel  it 

within  them. 
Hear  me  then  !  while  in  a  few  brief  words  I  declare  my  opinion. 
Lo  !  how,  encircling  thee  round,  on  all  sides  blazes  the  battle : 
Yet,  of  the  Trojan  host  who  have  scaled  the  wall,  there  are  many 
Standing  apart  with  their  arms,  inactive :  while  the  remainder 
Fight,  with  the  many  the  few,  dispersed  through  the  ships  and  divided. 
Therefore  some  space  withdraw  and  call  together  our  leaders,  (740) 
So  shall  we  fully  discuss  our  further  plans,  and  determine 
Whether  to  rush  once  more  on  the  beaked  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Trusting   to    Heav'n   and   our   strength   for  success,   or  retire  from 

the  contest, 
Saving  ourselves  from  utter  defeat :  for  sorely  I  fear  me 
Lest  they  repay  us  the  fearful  debt  of  yesterday's  carnage. 
There  at  the  ships  is  one  who  but  holds  him  aloof  from  the  battle, 
Dreadful  in  war ;  nor  long  will  abstain  when  he  sees  us  advancing." 
Thus  spake   Polydamas.     Safe  seemed  the  counsel  and  pleasing 

to  Hector. 
Down  on  the  ground  at  once  he  sprang  full  armed  from  his  chariot, 
And  in  reply  these  words  addressed  in  haste  to  the  chieftain:    (750) 

"Thou,  O  Polydamas!  here  collect  our  leaders  around  thee; 
First  must  I  visit  our  squadrons,  and  place  our  battle  in  safety, 
Soon  to  return  when  all  is  arranged  and  the  troops  have  their  orders." 
White   with   conspicuous   plumes,    like   a   snow-capped   peak,    he 

departed. 
Shouting,  the  Tro'ian  host  and  their  brave  allies  he  encouraged, 
Flying  through  all  their  ranks  :  while  the  chiefs  great  Hector  obeying 
Gathered  round  brave  Polydamas,  Panthoiis'  son,  at  his  summons. 
Hector  the  while,  through  the  foremost  ranks,  in  the  front  of  the 

battle 
Ranging,  Deiphobus  sought  in  vain  ;  nor  King  Helenus  found  he ; 
Adamas,  Asias'  son;  nor  Asius,  Hyrtacus'  offspring.  (760) 

Many  a  Trojan,  wounded,  though  not  unto  death,  he  encountered; 
Many  a  hero  stretched  on  the  sand,  by  the  sterns  of  the  vessels, 


Book  XIII.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Lifeless    he    found,    struck    down    by    the    slaughtering   brands    of 

the  Argives, 
Or  at  the  wall,  by  their  spears  and  darts  transfixed  and  expiring. 
Paris  he  soon  perceived,  the  fair-haired  Helena's  husband, 
Fighting,  grievously  prest  on  the  left  of  the  field,  and  his  comrades 
Cheering,  and  urging  them  on  with  encouraging  words  to  the  conflict. 
Hector  approached,  and  in  bitter  mood  thus  sharply  addressed  him  : 
"Paris!  too  fatally  fair!  Seducer  of  women  !  Deceiver! 
Where  is  Deiphobus?     Where  King  Helenus,  J&gt;roJ&gt;het  and  warrior? 
Adamas,  Asias'  son,  and  Asius,  Hyrtacus'  offspring?  (77 1) 

Where  is  Othryoneus  ?     Now,  alas !   from  her  base  to  her  summit 
Ilion  nods  to  her  fall.     Now  sure  destruction  awaits  us !" 

Paris  in  gentle  terms  replied,  addressing  his  brother : 
"Hector  !  thy  words  are  unjust.    This  time  thy  reproof  I  deserve  not, 
Backward  indeed  may  I  sometimes  seem, — less  eager  for  combat, 
Yet  not  wanting  in  courage  or  force  hath  my  mother  produced  me. 
Here,  since  first  at  the  ships  thou  formed'st  the  array  of  our  battle 
Firm  have  we  stood,  and  unflinching  repelled  th'  assault  of  the  Grecians. 
As  for  the  friends  thou  seek'st  they  are  dead.     Deiphobus  only, 
Helenus  too,  from  the  field  have  retired  disabled,  and  wounded 
Each   in   the   hand   by  a   spear :    though   by  Zeus   preserved   from 

destruction. 
Now  lead  on  wherever  thy  heart  and  spirit  direct  thee, 
Fully  resolved,  we  follow.    No  cause  shalt  thou  have  to  reproach  us, 
Nor  shall  our  courage  fail  thee  in  all  that  man  can  accomplish. 
Bear,  however,  this  truth  in  mi?id,  and  be  just  to  our  efforts: 
No  one  beyond  his  strength  can  fight,  how  willing  soever." 

Soft  fell  the  hero's  words  and  appeased  the  mood  of  his  brother. 
Thither  they  fared,  where  loudest  rose  the  din  of  the  combat 
Round  Cebriones,  round  Polydamas  noble  and  valiant,  (79°) 

Phalces,  Orthaeus  the  bold,  and  the  all  but  divine  Polypaetes, 
Palmys,  and  both*  Hyppotion's  sons,  Ascanius  and  Morys, 
Who  but  the  day  before  from  the  fertile  plains  of  Ascania 
Joined,  reinforcing  the  Trojans;  by  Zeus  hurried  on  to  the  battle. 
On  they  rushed,  like  the  wrathful  blast  which  down  from  the  mountains, 
Driv'n  by  the  thunders  of  Zeus,  invades  the  plain,  to  the  ocean,

[Book  XIII. 


Sweeping  in  wild  uproar,  high  tossing  the  billows  beneath  it 
Churned  into  foam,  and  curled  aloft,  and  dashing  together 
Loud-resounding; — wave  upon  wave,  one  chasing  another: 
Thus     came    the    Trojans,    rank    upon    rank,    and    squadron    on 

squadron,  (800) 

Sweeping  along,  as  refulgent  in  arms  they  followed  their  leaders. 
Priam's  heroic  son  in  the  van,  like  death-dealing  Ares, 
Marched ;  his  bright  and  full-orb'd  shield  uprearing  before  him 
Thickened   with    many   a   hide,    and   with   bronze   o'erlaid.      From 

his  temples 
Flashed  with  each  nod  as  he  moved  the  brazen  gleam  of  his  helmet. 
Each  of  the  Grecian  bands  in  turn  he  essayed,  and  advancing 
Under  that  mighty  shield,  he  tried  their  force  and  endurance. 
Yet  not  an  Argive  heart  knew  fear,  nor  shrank  from  the  trial. 
Aias  at  length  strode  forth  from  their  line,  and  provoked  him  to 

battle : 
"Madman!  come  on!     Thus   think'st  thou  then  to  frighten  the 

Grecians?  (810) 

We  too  know  something  of  warlike  deeds,  and  martial  encounters, 
Albeit  the  wrath  of  Zeus  just  now  weighs  heavy  upon  us. 
High  are  thy  hopes,  no  doubt,  to  ravage  our  fleet,  and  destroy  us; 
We  too  however  have  hands  and  hearts,  and  know  to  defend  them. 
Long  before  that  shall  your  vaunted  Troy,  so  rich  and  so  peopled, 
Lie  at  our  feet,  by  Grecian  hands  destroyed  and  subverted. 
Thou  thyself,  be  assured,  to  Zeus  and  to  all  the  immortals 
Soon  shalt  have  cause  in  thy  terror  to  pray,  that,  fleeter  than  falcons 
Scouring  the  plain  in  headlong  flight,  in  dust  and  dishonour 
Soiling  their  snowy  manes,  thy  steeds  to  the  city  may  bear  thee."  (820) 

Thus  as  he  spake,  behold  !  on  his  right  high  soaring  an  eagle 
Floated  conspicuous  in  air.     Then  arose  a  shout  from  the  Argives 
Hailing  the  omen  with  joy;  while  Hector  sternly  responded: 
"Aias  !  boastful  and  loud  !  what  words  are  these  thou  hast  spoken? 
Would  I  were  half  so  sure  to  be  called  a  child  of  the  Thund'rer, 
Ever  in  life  and  in  light  to  reign,  as  if  Hera  had  borne  me 
Honoured  by  Gods  and  men  like  Athena  herself,  or  Apollo, 
As  that  this  very  day  shall  destruction  bring  to  the  Grecians 


Book  XIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  291 

One    and    all.      Nor    thyself    shalt    escape    shouldst   thou    dare    to 

withstand  me — 
Dare  to  await  my  spear.    Thy  dainty  flesh  shall  it  feed  on !     (830) 
Dogs  and  the  vultures  of  Troy  shall  tear  thy  limbs,  and  shall  fatten 
On  thy  unburied  remains  outstretched  on  the  shore  by  the  vessels." 
Thus  having  said  the  assault  he  led.    Loud  shouts  from  his  foll'wers 
Rose ;  and  the  ranks  behind  redoubled  the  shouts  of  the  foremost. 
Shouted  the  Greeks  in  reply ;  and,  their  ancient  prowess  rememb'ring 
Stood  to  their  arms ;  and  unmoved,  the  Troian  onset  awaited. 
Borne  through  the  air  to  the  courts  of  Zeus  their  clamour  ascended.

Argument. 

Nestor  alarmed  at  the  near  approach  of  the  Trojans  seeks  Agamemnon, 
whom  he  finds  in  co??ipany  with  Odysseus  and  Diomede.  Agamemnon 
advises  to  launch  the  ships  and  make  a  precipitate  retreat.  Odysseus 
reproves  him.  Dioinede  proposes,  wounded  as  they  are,  to  shew  themselves 
and  encourage  the  troops.  0?i  their  way  Poseidon  encourages  Agameinnon. 
Hera,  to  inveigle  Zeus,  adorns  herself  atid  borrows  the  cestus  of  Aphrodite, 
then^  with  the  aid  of  the  God  of  Sleep,  she  succeeds  in  encha7iting  Zeus 
with  her  char?ns,  and  throwing  him  into  a  deep  sleep.  Of  this  Poseidon 
takes  advantage,  a7id  openly  succours  the  Greeks.  Heclor  is  struck  down 
by  Aias  with  a  huge  stone  and  carried  off  the  field.  The  Trojans  again 
give  way. 


ILIAD.     BOOK  XIV. 


TVfESTOR  the  shouting  heard,  where  he  sate  retired with  Machaon, 

Quaffing  the  dark-red  wine;  and  thus  he  bespake  his  companion  : 
"Tell  me,  Machaon  divine,  what  means  this  unwonted  confusion? 
Loud,  and  nearer  the  shouts  of  our  youth  approach  to  the  vessels. 
Stay  thou  here,  and  with  cordial  wine  replenish  thy  goblet. 
While  Hecamede  the  genial  bath  prepares  for  thy  comfort, 
Strength' 'ning  and  warm,  and  cleanses  the  clotted  gore  from  thy  shoulder, 
I  to  some  lofty  point  will  proceed,  and  observe  what  is  passing." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  gorgeous  shield  of  his  son  Thrasymedes 
Lying  by  chance  in  his  tent  he  took,  all  brazen  and  gleaming;  (10) 

(He,  by  some  hap,  had  borne  his  father's  shield  in  the  combat), 
Snatched  up  his  trusty  spear  with  bronze  sharp  pointed,  and  issued 
Forth   from   his   tent.     Unseemly  and  sad  was    the    sight   that   he 

witnessed — 
Greeks  in  confused  retreat,  and  the  haughty  Trojans  pursuing, 
Routing  their  rear:    and   the  wall    they   had   built   to  protecl  them 

demolished. 
As  when  with  balanced  sway,  all  silently  heaving,  the  ocean 
Darkens,  idly  awaiting  the  shrill-voiced  wind  which  shall  drive  it 
This  way  or  that :  uncertain  it  swells  and  subsides,  till  the  moment 
Comes,  when   some  heav'n-sent  blast  determines   the  sweep  of  its 

billows : 
Thus  the  old  chief  in  his  mind  debated,  much  undecided,         (20) 
Whether  at  once  to  join  the  Greeks  and  share  in  the  conflict, 


296  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 

Or  to  Atreides  repair,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people. 
This  he  at  length  resolved;  for  wiser  it  seemed  in  his  judgment 
Great  Agamemnon  to  seek.     Meanwhile  contending,  the  warriors 
Slew  and  were  slain.     Loud  clanged  the  protecting  bronze  on  their 

bosoms, 
Under  the  fast-falling  strokes  of  spears  and  two-edged  falchions. 
Nestor,  the  while,  on  his  path  the  Grecian  princes  encountered, 
Wending  their  way   by   the  ships;   those  chiefs  whom  wounds  had 

disabled  ; 
Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon ;  Odysseus ;  brave  Diomedes. 
Far  from  the  scene  of  combat  the  Grecian  vessels  were  stationed,  (30) 
High  drawn  up  on  the  shore  of  the  hoary  sea;  and  beyond  it, 
Far  on  the  land  were  the  first,  whose  sterns  by  a  wall  were  protected. 
Broad  was  the  beach,  yet  sufficed  it  not  for  the  number  of  vessels. 
Close  together  arranged  they  stood,  and  the  people  were  crowded. 
Rank  behind  rank  drawn  up,  they  filled,  in  unbroken  succession, 
All  the  recess  of  the  spacious  bay,  from  headland  to  headland. 
There  came  the  princes,  pacing  along,  and  viewing  the  battle, 
Leaning  upon  their  spears :  while  dismal  a?id  gloomy  forebodings 
Saddened  their  souls.     Nor  did  Nestor's  observed  approach  reassure 

them. 
Filled  were  their  hearts  with  alarm,  when  they  saw  him  advancing  to 

meet  them.  (40) 

King  Agamemnon  first  demanded  the  cause  of  his  coming: 
"Nestor!  Neleus'  son,  thou  glory  and  pride  of  Achaia! 
AVhy  art  thou  here?    Why  leav'st  thou  the  bleediftg  ranks  of  the  battle? 
Sorely  I  dread  lest  Hector  make  good  that  vaunt  which  he  uttered, 
Threat'ning  aloud,  and  with  boastful  words  haranguing  his  Trojans. 
Never,  he  swore,  would  he  quit  our  ships  and  return  to  the  city, 
Till  in  one  fiery  blaze  he  had  wrapped  them,  and  slaughtered  our 

army. 
Thus  he   harangued,   thus  threatened,  and  now  will   his  threats  be 

accomplished. 
Doubtless,  ye  Gods  !  the  rest  of  the  Greeks,  no  less  than  Achilles, 
Hate  me,  and  harbour  resentful  thoughts  against  their  commander,  (50) 
Else  would  they  surely  fight,  thus  pushed  to  the  sterns  of  their  vessels." 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  297 

Thus  then  replied  that  ancient  knight,  Gerenian  Nestor  : 
"Such  is  our  state  indeed !     Too  true  the  things  thou  hast  spoken. 
Scarce  could  the  Thunderer's  self  avert  the  ruin  impending. 
Fall'n  is  our  rampart  wall,  that  all  but  impregnable  barrier, 
Which,  as  the  sure  defence  of  ourselves  and  vessels,  we  trusted. 
Still  however  in  front  of  the  ships  our  obstinate  conflict 
Rages.     'Twere  hard  to  say,  how  close  soe'er  thine  inspection, 
Y\  here  is  the  direst  confusion,  where  worst  the  Grecians  are  routed. 
All  promiscuous  they  fall,  and  the  skies  are  rent  by  the  clamour;  (60) 
Therefore  consider  we  now  what  course  to  adopt,  if  our  counsels 
Aught  may  avail  in  so  dire  a  strait.     For  to  rush  into  battle 
Counsel  I  not.     The  wounded  can  lend  but  feeble  assistance." 

Thus  then  in  turn  responded  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon : 
"Nestor!  now  that  in  front  of  our  ships  the  battle  is  raging, 
Now  that  our  wall  unavailing  has  proved,  and  the  trench,  which  the 

Grecians 
Fought  so  hard  to  defend, — which  we  thought  an  impassable  barrier, 
Which,  as  the  sure  defence  of  ourselves  and  our  armies,  we  trusted; 
Clearly  I  see  that  Almighty  Zeus  hath  willed  our  destruction, 
Willed  that  from  Argos  afar  the  Greeks  inglorious  shall  perish.       (70) 
Once  I  fondly  believed  that  he  favoured  our  cause  and  would  aid  us, 
Now  the  reverse  is  clear.     Like  Gods  he  honours  the  Trojans, 
Greece  he  forsakes,  and  binds  our  hands  and  enfeebles  our  courage. 
Now  then  attend  to  my  words,  and  lend  me  all  your  assistance; 
Let  us  at  once  these  ships  which  are  nearest  the  shore  to  the  water 
Draw,  thus  clearing  the  beach,  and  set  them  afloat  on  the  ocean, 
Moored    to   their  sleepers.      There   let  them   ride   till  night   shall 

envelope 
All  in  her  veil,  and  the  Trojans  awhile  shall  cease  to  assail  us. 
Then  let  us  launch  the  rest,  and  embark;  for  blameless  I  hold  it, 
Even  by  night,  if  we  can,  to  escape  from  certain  destruction.   (80) 
Better  to  fly  and  be  safe,  than  remain  and  fall  into  mischief." 

Scornfully  frowning  thus  replied  the  thoughtful  Odysseus  : 
"What  do  I  hear?     What  words  have  escaped  thy  lips,  O  Atreides? 
Craven !  would  that  some  other,  some  baser  host  thou  commandedst, 
Rather  than  us  with  thy  sway  disgrace,  to  whom  Zeus  hath  accorded 


298  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 

Ever,  from  youth  to  age,  with  honour  to  fight,  and  accomplish 
Each  stern  duty  of  war,  until  death  shall  crown  us  with  glory. 
What?  wouldst  thou  then  abandon  the  wide-wayed  city  of  Troia, 
Long  beleaguered,  at  such  dire  cost  of  endurance  and  hardship? 
Speak  not  those  words  again,  lest  some  other  Achaian  should  hear 
them :  (90) 

Words,  which  to  pass  his  lips  no  mortal  would  ever  have  suffered, 
Gifted  with  spirit  and  sense  to  discern  the  right  and  the  prudent : 
Much  less  a  king,  and  the  king  of  a  mighty  nation,  in  numbers 
Such,  and  in  warlike  fame  as  that  thou  rulest  in  Argos. 
Nor  do  I  less  thy  judgment  impeach  than  thy  spirit  and  courage: 
Who,  while  the  battle  is  raging  aloud,  wouldst  order  the  vessels 
Down  to  the  sea  to  be  drawn,  to  complete  the  joy  of  the  Trojans, 
Giving  them  all  their  heart's  desire,  already  victorious, 
Headlong  destruction  bringing  on  Greece :  for  how  can  the  Argives 
Fight,  and  their  ground  maintain,  while  dragging  their  ships  to  the 
ocean?  (IO°) 

That  to  perform  they  must  quit  their  ranks,  and  abandon  the  battle, 
Such  were  the  end  of  thy  scheme !     Most  sage  and  valorous  leader !" 

Then  making  answer  replied  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon  : 
"Deeply  I  feel  thy  cutting  and  sharp  reproof,  O  Odysseus! 
Nor  have  I  yet  commanded  the  Greeks  to  abandon  the  battle, 
Launch  their  ships  on  the  deep,  unwilling,  and  fly  from  destruction. 
Therefore,  whoe'er  he  be  who  shall  proffer  a  wiser  opinion, 
Old  or  young,  let  him  speak,  and  with  joy  will  Atreides  receive  it." 

Then  Diomedes,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  responded : 
"  Here  is  the  man,  not  far  to  seek,  if  indeed  ye  be  willing,  (no) 

Calmly  to  hear,  nor  reject  with  disdain  the  advice  I  shall  offer, 
Wanting  the  sanction  of  riper  years  and  maturer  experience. 
Yet  from  a  brave  and  noble  sire  may  I  boast  my  extraction, 
Tydeus,  whose  high  sepulchral  mound  is  conspicuous  in  Thebas. 
Portheus  had  three  brave  sons,  distinguished  for  virtue  and  valour, 
Who  in  the  lofty  Calydon  dwelt,  and  the  city  of  Pleuron, 
Agrius,  Melas,  and,  last  by  birth  though  foremost  in  prowess, 
(Eneus,  my  father's  sire,  that  fierce  and  redoubtable  horseman. 
CEneus  at  home  remained,  but  my  father,  an  exile,  to  Argos 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  299 

Wandering,  dwelt :  so  Zeus  ordained  and  the  other  immortals.      (120) 
There,  to  Adrastus'  daughter  wedded,  he  built  him  a  mansion 
Stately,  and  lived  in  wealth.     Full  many  an  acre  of  corn-land, 
Owned  him  for  lord ;  rich  vineyards ;  flocks  and  herds  in  abundance. 
Far  before  all  in  Achaia  his  fame  went  forth  as  a  warrior. 
Things  like  these,  well  known,  must  needs  be  fresh  in  your  mem'ries. 
Scorn  not  then  my  advice  as  of  one  unworthy  your  notice, 
Base-born  and  low,  of  a  race  unknown  to  fame  and  distinction. 
Let  us  at  once  to  the  fight,  though  wounded.     Such  is  our  duty, 
Yet  must  we  stand  aloof,  and  bear  no  part  in  the  combat, 
Out  of  the  reach  of  arrows,  lest  wound  on  wound  be  inflicted.      (130) 
There  be  our  task,  to  cheer  the  brave,  and  urge  on  the  laggard, 
Such  as  delight  not  in  war,  and  would  spare  themselves  in  the  struggle." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  chiefs  gave  heed  to  his  words  and  obeyed 
them. 
Forth  they  wended ;   the  way  being  led  by  king  Agamemnon. 

Watchful  beheld  their  march  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon, 
Who  in  the  form  of  an  ancient  warrior  advancing  to  meet  them, 
Grasped,  and  pressing  with  friendly  warmth  the  hand  of  Atreides, 
Thus  with  encouraging  words  revived  the  hopes  of  the  monarch : 

"Royal  Atreides  !    Now  doth  the  vengeful  heart  of  Achilles 
Leap  in  his  bosom  for  joy,  when  he  sees  the  defeat  of  the  Grecians,  (140) 
Routed  and  slain ;  devoid  alike  of  shame  and  of  pity. 
So  may  he  perish  !  so  with  disgrace  may  the  Gods  overwhelm  him ! 
Think  not  howbeit  they  all  in  wrath  thy  cause  have  abandoned. 
Yet  shall  thine  eyes  behold  the  Troian  princes  and  leaders, 
Scouring  in  headlong  flight  o'er  the  dusty  plain,  and  to  Ilion 
Hurrying,  and  leaving  behind  our  tents  and  vessels  uninjured." 

Thus  having  said,  he  left  them,  and  rushed  o'er  the  plain  to  the  battle 
Furious,  sending  before  him  a  dire  and  terrible  war-cry 
Loud  as  the  shout  of  ten  thousand  warriors  closing  in  battle. 
Such  and  so  vast  the  roar  from  the  ample  chest  of  Poseidon        (150) 
Sent  forth  abroad.     Fresh  strength  to  each  Grecian  heart  it  imparted, 
Still  to  maintain  the  struggle,  and  fight  it  out  to  the  utmost. 

Here  now  from  her  golden  throne  on  the  heights  of  Olympus 
Turned  her  resplendent  eyes,  to  behold  the  aclions  of  7nortals. 


3oo  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 

Soon  she  perceived  and  knew  her  brother  (her  own  and  her  consort's) 
Actively  mixing  in  fight,  and  her  soul  rejoiced  when  she  saw  him, 
Zeus  too,  on  Ida's  loftiest  peak  all  streaming  with  fountains, 
Sitting  apart  she  beheld,  and  her  heart  was  embittered  with  hatred. 
Straightway,  however,  the  thought  arose  in  the  mind  of  the  goddess, 
How  to  beguile,  and  divert  for  a  time,  the  Thund'rer's  attention.  (160) 
This  to  her  mind  appeared  the  most  available  counsel : 
Ida  to  seek,  arrayed  in  all  her  choicest  adornments, 
There   in  soft   dalliance   to   hold   him   engaged,   unsuspecting   and 

careless, 
Till  o'er  his  senses  should  steal  the  o'erpow'ring  pressure  of  slumber, 
Quenching  the  light  of  his  eyes  in  darkness,  his  thoughts  in  oblivion. 
So  to  her  chamber  fair  she  repaired,  by  Hephaestus  constructed. 
Closed  were  its  solid  doors  with  a  secret  bolt,  which  his  mother 
Only,  among  the  Gods,  possessed  the  skill  to  unfasten. 
Entered,  she  closed  the  door,  and  locked  it  secure  from  intrusion. 
Then  with  Ambrosia  laved  her  pure  and  delicate  person,  i1']0) 

Making  the  fair  yet  fairer,  and  rich  ambrosial  unguents 
Copious  affused,  and  odorous  oils,  which,  sprinkling  the  pavement, 
Wafted  afar  through  the  bow'r  and  the  bronze-built  halls  of  Olympus 
Fragrance,  by  winds  caught  up  and  diffused  through  earth  and  through 

heaven. 
Such  the  perfume  from  the  Goddess  that  breathed.     Then  combing 

her  tresses, 
Wavy  and  bright;  with  her  slender  fingers  she  twined  them  in  ringlets, 
From  her  immortal  head  down  rippling  i7i  gold  der  her  shoulders. 
Next  round  her  form  an  ambrosial  robe  she  flung,  by  Athene 
Curiously  wrought,  with  many  a  wond'rous  feat  of  embroid'ry, 
Which  to  confine  o'er  her  bosom,  with  golden  clasps  she  secured  it; 
Adding  a  zone  of  an  hundred  fringes  her  waist  to  encircle.    (181) 
Gleaming  pendants  hung  from  her  pierced  ears,  and  a  jewel 
Threefold  sparkled  in  each.     All  grace  shone  forth  in  her  movements. 
Floating  adown  from  her  queenly  head  a  veil  there  descended 
Beauteous  and  newly  wrought,  which  shone  like  the  sun  in  its  splen- 
dour. 
Under  her  snowy  feet  her  sandals  rich  she  adjusted; 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


Stepped  forth  then  from  her  chamber  in  perfect  and  faultless  adorn- 
ment, 
And  to  her  presence  summoned  the  goddess  of  smiles,  Aphrodite. 
Thus  then,  apart  from  the  rest  of  the  Gods,  she  blandly  addressed  her  : 

"  Say,  dear  child !  wilt  thou  give  me  thine  aid  and  do  what  I  ask 
thee?  (I9°) 

Or  must  I  look  for  nought  at  thy  hands  save  angry  refusal 
For  that  I  favour  the  Greeks,   thy  wishes  inclining  to  Troia?" 
Thus  then  spake  in  reply  the  daughter  of  Zeus,  Aphrodite: 
"Here!  Goddess  august  and  revered!  great  daughter  of  Kronos  ! 
Only  declare  thy  will,  and  be  sure  of  my  ready  obedience, 
If  it  be  aught  that  lies  within  my  pow'r  to  accomplish." 

Thus  then,  in  words  of  deceptive  guile,  great  Hera  responded: 
"Give  me  that  charm  of  love  and  of  unresisted  attraction,  ' 
Which  to  thy  will  subdues  all  hearts  of  Gods  and  of  mortals. 
Now  on  a  visit  I  go  unto  Earth's  extremes,  where  the  Ocean,  (200) 
Parent  of  Gods,  extends,  and  to  Tethys,  mother  of  all  things. 
These  received  me  from  Rhea :  they  nursed  with  care  and  they  reared 

me 
In  their  primeval  mansion,  when  Zeus  with  Kronos  contending 
Whelmed  him  beneath  the  earth  and  the  barren  expanse  of  the  waters: 
Thither  I  go  on  a  mission  of  peace,  to  heal  their  dissensions. 
Long  have  they  kept  asunder,  refusing  each  other's  embraces, 
Shunning  their  mutual  couch,  their  hearts  embittered  by  anger. 
Could  I  with  soft  persuasive  words  appease  their  aversion, 
Bring  them  together  again,  and  join  them  in  love  for  the  future, 
How  would  they  then  revere  my  name  and  acknowledge  my  kind- 
ness!" (210) 
Then  making  answer  replied  the  goddess  of  smiles  Aphrodite: 
"Vain  in  itself,  and  unseemly  too,  were  the  thought  of  refusal 
To  the  great  queen  of  heav'n  who  reclines  in  the  arms  of  its  sov'reign." 
Thus  she  spake,  and  unbound  from  her  wraist  th'  all-powerful  cestus, 
Wondrously  wrought,  in  whose  circuit  lurked  each  charm  and  allure- 
ment, 
Longing  Desire  and  adoring  Love,  sweet  mutual  Endearment, 
Soft  seductive  Persuasion  which  steals  the  soul  from  the  prudent. 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 


This  in  the  hands  of  Hera  she  placed,  and  thus  she  bespake  her: 
"  Take  this  sash,  conceal  it,  and  wear  it  pressed  to  thy  bosom. 
In  its  embroidered  circlet  are  all  my  charms.     It  will  aid  thee      (220) 
All  thou  desir'st  to  perform;  nor  return  with  thy  wish  unaccomplished." 

Thus  she  spake;  and  with  smiles  the  goddess  accepted  the  cestus: 
Joy  dilating  her  glorious  eyes,  in  her  bosom  she  placed  it. 

Then  to  her  palace  returned  the  daughter  of  Zeus,  Aphrodite. 
Here  down  from  Olympus  plunged,  not  losing  a  moment, 
Swift  o'er  the  rich  Pierian  plains,  and  Emathia  the  lovely, 
Passed;  and  o'er  Thracia's  snowy  peaks  and  loftiest  summits 
Skimmed ;  her  feet  not  touching  the  earth  :  then  downward  from  Athos 
Glancing  swept,  far  borne  o'er  the  billowy  face  of  the  Ocean, 
Lemnos  at  length  she  reached,  the  realm  of  Thoas  the  Godlike.    (230) 
There  the  abode  of  Sleep,  Death's  brother,  she  sought:   having  found 

him 
Eager  she  clung  to  his  hand,  and  named  him  by  name,  and  addressed 

him : 
tl  Sleep !  subduer  of  every  God,  of  every  mortal ! 
If  thou  hast  e'er  obeyed  my  words,  or  accomplished  my  wishes, 
Now  be  persuaded  ;  and  grateful  for  ever  henceforth  shalt  thou  find  me. 
Close  the  refulgent  eyes  of  Zeus,  and  weigh  down  his  eyelids, 
Soon  as  in  love's  soft  trance  on  his  couch  reclined  thou  shalt  find  him  ; 
So  will  I  give  thee  a  golden  throne  untarnishing,  gorgeous, 
This  shall  my  limping  son,  my  Hephaestus,  make ;  for  thy  comfort, 
Placing  beneath  it  a  rich-wrought  footstool  soft  and  convenient,     (240) 
Where  thou  mayst  rest  thy  feet  in  luxurious  ease,  at  thy  banquets." 

Thus  making  answer  replied  the  soft  dispenser  of  slumbers :   . 
"Here!    Goddess  august  and  revered!   great  daughter  of  Kronos ; 
Over  all  other  Gods  might  I  wave  my  rod,  and  in  slumber 
Easily  seal  their  eyes.     Not  Oceanus'  self  could  resist  me, 
Though  round  the  world  his  streams  he  roll,  the  producer  of  all  things. 
Zeus  however  I  may  not  approach,  unbidden,  uncalled  for, 
Nor  on  Kronion's  lids  presume  to  shed  my  enchantments. 
Once  before  has  thy  dread  command  impelled  me  to  try  it, 
When  his  own  ail-too  daring  son,  the  mighty  Heracles,  (25°) 

Sailed  from  the  Troian  shores,  full  flushed  with  the  conquest  of  Ilion. 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  303 

Then  did  I  pour  myself  round  the  Thunderers  soul,  and  insidious 
Steal  on  his  sense,  while  thou  wrought'st  out  thy  project  of  mischief, 
Rousing  the  angry  Avinds  and  scattering  his  fleet  o'er  the  waters ; 
Hurrying  the  hero  away,  deprived  of  his  friends  and  companions, 
Far  aside  to  the  Coan  Isle.     When  the  Father  awakened 
Dire  was  his  wrath  ;  and  Gods  on  Gods  he  hurled  through  Olympus. 
Me  did  he  chiefly  seek,  and  down  to  the  sea  had  he  dashed  me 
Lost  for  ever :  but  Night  was  my  refuge.     Flying  I  sought  her 
Mother  of  Gods  and  men.     For  Zeus,  however  indignant,       (260) 
Dreaded  the  realm  to  invade  of  that  swift  mysterious  Power. 
And  shall  I  now  once  more  incur  so  fearful  a  hazard  ? " 

Thus  he  spake,  and  thus  imperial  Hera  responded  : 
"Why  art  thou  thus  dismayed,  O  Sleep?    Why  talkst  thou  of  danger? 
Think'st  thou  that  thundering  Zeus  such  vengeance  will  take  for  the 

Trojans 
As  for  Heracles,  his  own  dear  son,  when  his  wrath  was  excited  ? 
Hear  me  !     Do  this,  and  a  bride  will  I  give  thee,  one  of  my  Graces, 
Youngest  and  fairest  of  all,  Pasithea's  self.     Thou  shalt  wed  her, 
Her,  whom  thy  heart  for  many  a  day  hath  worshipped  and  longed  for." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  delighted  Sleep  this  answer  returned  her  :  (270) 
"Swear  then!  Swear  by  the  dark  inviolate  Stygian  torrent! 
Stretch  forth  one  of  thine  hands  on  the  fruitful  earth,  and  the  other 
Over  the  cold  and  barren  expanse  of  the  sea;  and  to  witness, 
Call  those  infernal  and  awful  Gods,  the  associates  of  Kronos, 
That  thou  wilt  give  me  Pasithea's  self,  of  thy  Graces  the  youngest, 
Her  whom  my  heart  hath  so  long  desired,  and  unite  us  in  wedlock." 

Thus  insisting  he  spake:  nor  did  Hera  refuse  her  compliance; 
What  he  requir'd  she  swore;  and  she  named  the  names  of  the  Titans, 
(So  are  they  called)  beneath  Tartarus  dwelling  in  pam  and  in  darkness  ; 
Calling  them  all  to  witness.    When  now  the  oath  was  completed  (280) 
Forth  they  fared:  the  Lemnian  isle  and  the  cities  of  Imbros 
Leaving,  in  mist  involved  they  pursued  their  path  o'er  the  waters. 
Ida,  the  nurse  of  savage  beasts  and  the  mother  of  fountains, 
Soon  did  they  reach,  and  Lectos  where  first  they  quitted  the  Ocean. 
Thence  over  land  they  swept,  and  the  dense  woods  shivered  beneath 
them.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XIV. 


There,  to  avoid  the  eyes  of  Zeus,  Sleep  lingered  behind  her, 
Mounting  aloft  on  a  spiry  fir,  the  tallest  on  Ida, 
Rearing  through  cloud  and  mist  its  stately  form  to  the  Heavens. 
There  did  he  sit,  concealed  by  its  thick  o'ershadowing  branches, 
Likened  in  form  to  the  bird  which  sends  forth  its  shriek  to  the  night- 
wind,  (290) 
Chalcis  called  by  the  Gods,  but  to  mortals  known  as  Cymindis. 

Hera  to  Gargarus  now,  the  loftiest  summit  of  Ida, 
Speeded.    The  cloud-compelling  Zeus  perceived  her  approaching. 
Soon  as  he  saw  her,  love  o'er  his  senses  stole,  and  a  rapture 
Seized  on  his  soul  like  that  when  first  he  gained  her  affections, 
Leading  her,  nothing  loth,  to  his  couch,  unknown  to  their  parents. 
Rising  to  meet  her  he  went,  and  endearingly  named  and  addressed  her: 
"Hera !  Why  leav'st  thou  Olympus?  What  cause  hath  brought  thee  to 

Ida? 
Why  do  I  see  thee  here  without  thy  steeds  and  thy  chariot?" 

Thus  then  in  words  of  deceptive  guile  bright  Hera  responded  1(300) 
"Hence  on  a  visit  I  go  unto  earth's  extremes,  where  the  Ocean, 
Parent  of  Gods,  extends,  and  Tethys,  mother  of  all  things. 
These  in  their  mansion  received,  and  reared  me  with  care  and  with 

kindness, 
Thither  I  go  on  a  mission  of  peace,  to  heal  their  dissensions. 
Long  have  they  kept  asunder,  refusing  each  other's  embraces, 
Shunning  their  mutual  couch,  their  hearts  embittered  with  anger. 
Here  on  the  skirts  of  many-rilled  Ida  my  steeds  and  my  chariot 
Stand,  awaiting  my  pleasure,  to  bear  me  o'er  land  and  o'er  ocean. 
Thou  thyself  art  the  cause  that  to  Ida  I  come,  thy  permission 
Seeking;  so  that  hereafter  thou  blame  me  not,  as  in  secret      (310) 
Stealing  away  to  visit  the  ocean  Pow'rs  in  their  palace." 

Thus  to  her  artful  speech  the  cloud-compeller  responded: 
"Hera !  suffice  some  future  day  to  accomplish  thy  mission. 
This,  ere  it  pass,  to  love  and  to  joy  let  us  give:  for  more  beauteous 
Ne'er  didst  thou  seem  i?i  mine  eyes,  nor  ever  for  Goddess  or  woman 
Glowed  my  heart  with  such  rapturous  love  as  now  that  I  view  thee. 
Not  so  loved  I   Ixion's   spouse,  who,  returning  my  passion, 
Made  me  Peirithoiis'  sire,  that  rival  of  gods  in  his  wisdom  : 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  305 

Not  so  inspired  me  Danae  the  fair,  Acrisius'  daughter, 
Mother  of  mighty  Perseus,  the  most  illustrious  of  warriors:      (320) 
Not  so  the  daughter  of  Phoenix,  the  first  and  most  famous  of  Princes, 
She  to  whom  Minos  owed  his  birth,  and  divine  Rhadamanthus : 
Not  so  Semele,  not  so  the  lovely  Theban  Alcmena 
(Semele  gave  Dionysus  birth,  chief  solace  of  mortals, 
Fair  Alcmena  my  noble  son,  the  mighty  Heracles) : 
Not  so  the  yellow  locks  and  the  queenly  grace  of  Demeter, 
Leto,  or  ev'n  thyself  in  the  pride  of  thy  maide?ily  beauty, 
Filled  me  with  love  like  that  thy  charms  now  raise  in  my  bosom." 
Thus  then  in  words  of  deceptive  guile  bright  Hera  responded  : 
"Offspring  of  Kronos  dread  !  What  words  are  these  thou  hast  spoken? 
This  is  no  fitting  place  in  love  to  indulge  and  in  dalliance,  (331) 

Here  upon  Ida's  top  where  all  is  exposed  and  unsheltered. 
How  would  it  be  if  one  of  the  Gods  should  chance  to  behold  us 
Locked  in  each  other's  arms  in  sleep?  and  should  hie  to  Olympus 
Telling  the  tale?    And  think'st  thou  I  e'er  could  return  to  our  palace, 
Fresh  from  thy  arms  ?    /  should  sink,  o'erwhelmed  with  shame  and 

confusion. 
Yet  if  thou  long  for  the  sweet  exchange  of  love  and  endearment, 
Shun  we  the  public  gaze.     Thy  Hephaestus  hath  built  thee  a  chamber, 
High  on  Olympus,  by  doors  and  bolts  secured  from  intrusion  : 
There,  if  thou  wilt,  retire,  a?id  spare  my  shame  and  my  blushes."     (340) 

Then  making  answer  in  turn,  the  cloud-compeller  responded : 
"Dread   not,   Hera!  the  gaze  to  encounter  of  Gods  or  of  mortals; 
Such  and  so  dense  a  golden  cloud  will  I  raise  to  involve  us, 
Not  the   all-seeing   sun,  whose   beams   through   the    earth   and   the 

heavens 
Dart,  shall  avail  to  pierce  that  thick,  mysterious  covert." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  her  beauteous  form  in  his  arms  he  encircled. 
Straightway  the  earth  from  her  teeming  lap  fresh  flow'rs  in  abundance 
Poured  forth.     The  crocus  bright  and  the  hyacinth  sprang,  and  the 

lotus 
Dewy;  and  soft  interwoven  they  swelled,  and  bore  up  the  lovers, (349) 
Forming  their  couch:  and  above  them  a  cloud  all  fragrant  and  golden 
Gathered,  and.  pearly  dews  distilled,  as  it  thickened  around  them. 


3o6  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 


Thus  in  the  arms  of  Hera,  by  love  and  by  sleep  overpowered, 
Zeus  on  Gargarus'  height  lay  entranced,  forgetful  of  all  things. 
Sleep  without  loss  of  time  set  forth  for  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Bearing  the  news  to  the  God  who  surrounds  the  world  with  his  waters. 
Close  to  his  elbow  he  stood,  and  thus  delivered  his   message  : 
"Now,  O  Poseidon!  bestow  thy  heartiest  aid  on  the  Grecians; 
Lead  them  to  victory  on:  for  a  while  at  least,  while  Kronion 
Lies  by  my  pow'r  subdued,  and  wrapped  in  a  mantle  of  slumber, 
Yielding  himself  to  love's  soft  spells  and  Hera's  delusions."  (360) 

Ending,  he  flew  to  dispense  his  gentle  solace  to  mortals. 
Then  on  another  and  bolder  effort  Poseidon  determined. 
Springing  at  once  to  the  front,  in  a  voice  of  thunder  he  shouted: 
"Argives!  Victory  thus  will  ye  tamely  abandon  to  Hector, 
Yield  to  the  son  of  Priam  your  ships,  and  crown  him  with  glory? 
Only  because  Achilles  still  holds  him  aloof  in  his  anger, 
Dares  he  put  forth  this  vaunt  and  indulge  in  this  insolent  menace. 
Small  were  our  need  of  Achilles'  aid,  were  we  only  determined 
Firmly  to  hold  our  ground,  and  stoutly  stand  by  each  other. 
Up  then!    Let  all  attend,  and  let  each  man  do  as  I  order.     (370) 
All  whose  heads  by  the  best  and  strongest  helms  are  protected, 
All  who  carry  the  broadest  shields,  whose  lances  are  longest, 
All  who  have  strength  to  wield  such  weapons  and  courage  to  use  them, 
Follow  my  lead.     Let  us  on !  and  we  soon  shall  see  whether  Hector, 
Let  him  be  ever  so  eager  for  fight,  will  dare  to  await  us. 
Such  of  the  brave  and  strong,  as  have  small,  unsuitable  bucklers, 
Change  them  with  feebler  men  whom  weightier  shields  but  encumber." 

Thus  he  spake ;  and  all  to  his  words  gave  ear  and  obeyed  him. 
Wounded  and  lame  as  they  were,  the  Princes  lent  their  assistance. 
Brave  Diomedes,  Odysseus,  and  Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon,       (380) 
Aided  the  troops  to  exchange  their  ill-sorted  arms,  and  allotted 
Such  as  were  best  to  the  stalwart  and  brave;  the  worst  to  the  feeble. 
Soon  they  resumed  their  ranks,  having  donned  their  glittering  armour, 
Then  marched  on.     At  their  head  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon 
Bore  in  his  pow'rful  grasp  a  long  and  ponderous  falchion, 
Lightning-flashing  and  dreadful  to  view.     Recoiling  with  horror, 
Mortal  valour  rebuked  would  shrink,  nor  venture  to  face  it. 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  307 

Hector  to  meet  such  stern  assault  concentered  his  forces, 
Undismayed,  and  arrayed  them  with  care  in  th'  order  of  battle. 
Fiercer  than  ever  before,  both  sides  prepared  for  the  struggle,      (390) 
Azure  Poseidon  leading  the  Greeks,  great  Hector  the  Trojans. 
Furious  the  sea  dashed  up  to  the  ships  and  tents  of  the  Grecians, 
Arjsw'ring   with   rude  applause  to  their  shout  as  they  closed  in  the 

conflict : 
Not  with  a  wilder  roar  do  its  waves  roll  in  from  the  offing, 
Scourging  some  rocky  beach,  with  the  blasts  of  impetuous  Boreas; 
Not  with  such  whirlwind  rush  do  the  crackling  flames  of  a  mountain 
Roar,  in  some  rifted  gorge  confined,  where  the  forests  are  blazing ; 
Not  with  such  fierce  persistent  howl  do  the  winds  in  their  fury 
Tear  through  the  foliage  d  crowns  of  the  lofty  oaks  that  oppose  them; — 
As   through  the  field  prevailed  when   the  Greeks  closed  in  on  the 

Trojans,  (4°°) 

Shouting  defiance  and  rage,  and  rending  the  sky  with  their  clamour. 

Hector  first  on  advancing  Aias  darted  his  jav'lin, 
Full  at  his  breast,  and  the  spear  went  straight  to  its  mark;  bat  alighted 
Just  where  the  two  broad  belts  on  his  bosom  crossed,  which  supported, 
This,  his  enormous  shield ;  that,  the  sword  with  its  scabbard  of  silver. 
Thus  he  escaped  unhurt,  while  Hector,  baffled  and  angry 
So  to  have  failed,  and  in  vain  dismissed  the  spear  that  he  trusted, 
Back  to  the  ranks  of  his  friends  'withdrew,  in  bitter  vexation. 
FoU'wing  him  up  as  he  went,  the  great  Telamonian  Aias 
Lifted  one  of  the  blocks  which  beneath  their  feet  in  abundance    (410) 
Lay,  having  served  as  supports  for  the  ships,  and  hurled  it  against 

him, 
Whirling  it  round :  and  it  spun  like  a  top  from  his  hands,  and  alighting 
Over  the  rim  of  his  shield,  where  springs  the  neck  from  the  shoulder, 
Crushed   him    down.     Like  an  oak  he  fell,  which  the  bolt  of  the 

thund'rer 
Smites  from  its  root,  amid  smould'ring  smoke  and  sulphury  vapour, 
Signs  of  his  wrath,  and  a  shudder  of  dread  on  ail  who  behold  it 
Fails,  when  in  presence  thus  they  witness  the  might  of  Kronion. 
Suddenly  smitten  to  earth  thus  Hector  lay,  and  his  jav'lin 
Quitted  his  grasp,  and  his  mighty  shield  and  helm  overwhelmed  him. 


20- 


3o8  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 

While  in  his  fall  loud  clashed  his  brazen  and  various  armour,       (420) 
Up  to  the  spot  ran  shouting  in  crowds  the  sons  of  Achaia. 
Hoping  to  drag  and  despoil  his  corse,  and  many  a  weapon 
Aimed  at  him  where  he  lay;  but  that  form  so  royal  and  sacred 
Spear  nor  arrow  availed  to  wound:  for  the  Princes  of  Troia 
Gathered  around  him,  Polydamas  brave,  and  godlike  Agenor, 
Great  ^neas,  Sarpedon  the  Lycian  sov'reign,  and  Glaucus. 
Nor  did  the  rest  of  his  friends  neglect  the  defence  of  their  leader. 
Round  him  they  closed  their  full-orb'd  shields;  while  others  behind 

them 
Lifted  and  bore  him  off  from  the  press :  then  sought  out  his  chariot 
Far  in  the  rear,  where  his  horses  stood,  and  attendants,  who  held  them 
Ready  at  need   to  the   bright   car   harnessed.     There    did  they  lay 
him,  (431) 

Gently  towards  the  city  the  groaning  hero  conveying. 

Now  had  they  reached  the  ford  of  the  fair  wide-eddying  Xanthus, 
Xanthus,  offspring  of  Zeus  immortal.     There  they  alighted, 
Lifting  him  softly  down  from  the  car;  and  water  they  sprinkled, 
Copious  and  fresh.     Then  he   breathed   once   more,  and  lifting  his 

eyelids 
Looked  on  the  sky;  then  knelt,  black  gore  from  his  bosom  ejecting; 
Then  once  more  sunk  back  on  the   ground,  and   the   shadows   of 

darkness 
Gathered  afresh  round  his  swimming  sight,  and  his  senses  forsook  him. 
Soon   as   the   Greeks   perceived   great    Hector   borne   from    the 
combat,  (440) 

On  with  renewed  and  impetuous  force  they  rushed  at  the  Trojans. 
Foremost  of  all  sprang  forward  the  swift  Oilean  Aias: 
Satnius,  CEnops'  son,  with  his  spear  he  pierced,  whom  a  Naiad 
Bore,  on  the  flowery  banks  of  Satnio's  stream,  by  his  father 
CEnops  frequented,  who  tended  his  flocks  and  herds  on  its  borders. 
Him  on  the  flank  Oileus  smote,  the  redoubtable  spearman 
Closing  upon  him.     Supine  on  the  ground  he  fell,  and  above  him 
Trojans  and  Greeks  engaged  in  a  fierce  and  desperate  struggle 
Mighty  Polydamas,   Panthous  son,  stood  forth  his  avenger, 
Hurled  his  spear,  and  full  on  his  shoulder  struck  Prothoenor,       (450) 


Book  XIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  309 

Great   Areilochus'    son.       The    spear    passed    straight    through    the 

shoulder, 
Issuing  behind :  and  he  fell,  and  clutched  the  dust  in  his  death-pang, 
Thus  then  in  loud  and  arrogant  tones  Polydamas  shouted  : 
"Never  in  vain,  methinks,  doth  a  jav'lin  speed  on  its  errand 
Sent  from  the  strong  right  hand  of  Panthoiis'  son.     In  his  person 
One  of  the  Greeks  just  now  hath  felt  its  point.     Let  him  take  it: 
Fit  support  for  his  downward  steps  to  the  mansion  of  Hades." 
Such   was  his   vaunt,   and  stirred  was    each  Argive  heart  at  the 

insult ; 
Deeply  it  moved  the  wrath  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias,       (459) 
Close  at  whose  side  he  stood  when  struck;  who,  lifting  his  weapon, 
Aimed  it  full  at  the  Trojan  chief  in  the  act  of  retiring. 
Deftly  springing  aside  from  the  blow,  black  death  he  avoided, 
While  in  his  stead  Archilochus,  offspring  of  godlike  Antenor, 
Caught   the  full   force   of  the   blow,   foredoomed   by   the   Gods   to 

destruction  j 
Just  at  the  nape,  where  the  neck  sustains  the  head,  it  alighted, 
Cutting  the  bones  and  tearing  the  two  strong  sinews  asunder: 
Down  dropped  his  head :  on  the  face  it  fell,  and  the  mouth  and  the 

nostrils 
Reached  the  ground,  while  the  limbs  for  a  moment  supported  his 

body. 
Answering  then  to  Polydamas'  taunt,  great  Aias  responded : 
"Man  for  man,  come  tell  me,  Polydamas!  which  is  the  worthier,  (470) 
Doth  not  he  who  hath  fall'n  to  my  spear  outweigh  Prothoenor? 
Base,  or  of  vulgar  descent  I  deem  him  not:  for  his  features 
One  of  Antenor's  race  proclaim  him.     Nay,  if  I  err  not, 
One  of  his  sons,  for  I  trace  in  the  lines  a  family  likeness." 

Thus  he  spake,  well  knowing  the  man.     Sore  grieved  were  the 

Trojans. 
Acamas  then,  fierce  stalking  around  the  corpse  of  his  brother 
Promachus  slew,  the  Boeotian  chief,  by  the  feet  who  had  seized  him. 
Then  in  exulting  tones  thus  shouted  aloud  to  the  Grecians : 
'•Argives,  no  better  than  bowmen!     In  threats  more  abounding  than 

actions  ! 


310  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIV. 

Not  upon  us  alone  shall  the  toils  and  sorrows  of  warfare        (480) 
Fall.     You  shall  have  your  share;  and  wounds  and  death  be  your 

portion. 
Lo  !   where  your   Promachus  sleeps,  by  my  spear  subdued.     For  a 

lesson 
Take  it.     Long  unrequited  I  left  not  the  death  of  my  brother. 
Happy  the  man  who  can  boast  that  come  what  may,  if  in  battle 
Destined  to  fall,  he  leaves  in  his  father's  house  an  avenger." 
Thus  he  spake :  and  each  Argive  heart  was  stirred  with  emotion. 
Peneleus'  warlike  soul  was  the  first  that  burned  with  resentment, 
Who  upon  Acamas  rushed.     But  he  turned  and  fled,  nor  awaited 
Royal  Peneleus'  charge.     Ilioneus  next  he  encountered 
(Son  of  the  wealthy  Phorbas,  whom  Hermes,  best  of  the  Trojans,  (490) 
Cherished   and   loved,    and  with   flocks   and   herds   and   boundless 

possessions 
Gifted),  his  fathefs  joy,  and  the  only  son  of  his  mother. 
Him   through   the  eye  he   pierced,    and   the   spear   passed   straight 

through  its  socket, 
Forcing  the  eyeball  out ;  and  its  course  held  on  till  it  issued 
Forth  at  the  back  of  the  skull ;  and  down  he  sank,  and  extended 
Helplessly  both  his  hands.     Then  Peneleus'  sword  from  the  scabbard 
Drew  he,  and  lopped   his  neck.     Down  dropped  the  head  with  its 

helmet 
Still  by  the  spear  transfixed.     This  lifting  aloft,  like  a  poppy 
Borne  on  its  stalk,  he  shewed  to  the  Troian  host,  and,  exulting, 
Shouted    aloud,    and    thus    with    triumphant    scorn    he    addressed 

them:  (5°°) 

"Trojans!  report  what  ye  see  to  your  boasted  Ilioneus'  parents. 
Tell  them  to  raise  the  funeral  wail,  a?id  lament  in  their  palace. 
Bitter  will  be  the  grief,  too,  of  Promachus'  wife  when  she  hastens 
Forth,  her  husband  to  greet,  the  offspring  of  great  Alegenor : 
We  meanwhile  in  our  ships  shall  return,  victorious,  from  Troia." 
Thus  while  he  spake,  pale  fear  and  horror  seized  on  the  Trojans, 
Each  gazing  anxious  around  for  a  way  of  escape  from  destruction. 

Tell  me,  ye  Muses!  ye  who  the  halls  of  Olympus  inhabit, 
Which  of  the  Greeks  first  won  the  blood-stain'd  spoils  of  a  foeman,

Now  that  earth-shaking  Poseidon  had  turned  the  tide  of  the  battle. 
Hyrtius  fell  to  the  spear  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias,  (511) 

Gyrtias'  son,  a  chief  of  renown,  and  the  Mysians'  leader. 
Phalces  and  Mermerus  next  to  Antilochus  fell,  and  he  spoiled  them. 
Moms,  Hippotion,  sank  beneath  brave  Merion's  jav'lin. 
Prothoon  died  on  Teucer's  spear,  and  fierce  Periphetes. 
Atreus'  son,  Hyperenor,  the  pastor  and  friend  of  his  people, 
Struck  through  the  flank;  and  the  thirsty  spear,  plunged  deep  in  his 

entrails, 
Drank  his  blood :  while  his  life  through  the  gaping  wound,  which  the 

weapon 
Left  when  withdrawn,  exhaled,  and  darkness  closed  o'er  his  eyelids. 
Far  surpassing  them  all  in  the  number  and  might  of  his  victims,   (520) 
Swift  Oilean  Aias  o'ertook  the  flying,  and  slew  them; 
Matchless  in  speed  to  pursue  whom  Zeus  in  disorder  had  scattered.

Argument. 


Ze  us  awakening,  and  seeing  the  Trojans  in  flight,  the  Greeks  advanc- 
ing aided  by  Poseidon,  and  Heclor  disabled,  is  indignant,  and  threatens 
Hera,  who  appeases  him.  She  is  sent  to  Olympus  to  summon  Iris  and 
Apollo,  who  go  to  receive  the  orders  of  Zeus.  Hera  excites  discontent 
amo7tg  the  Gods  and  in  particular  that  of  A  res  by  the  news  of  his  son's 
death.  He  is  on  the  point  of  breaking  into  open  rebellion,  but  is  prevented 
by  Pallas.  Iris  is  dispatched  to  Poseidon  to  order  him  to  leave  the  field, 
which  he  does  with  reluclance;  Apollo  restores  Heclor  and  brings  him  again 
on  the  field:  then  advancing  at  the  head  of  the  Trojans  with  the  sEgis  of 
Zeus,  he  levels  a  portion  of  the  trench  and  wall,  over  which  they  enter  and 
attack  the  fleet,  but  are  for  the  present  prevented  by  the  prowess  of  Aias 
from  firing  it.

IVTOW  in   their   flight   had  the  Trojans  recrossed  the  ditch  and 

•^  ^       the  rampart, 

Leaving  behind  them  many  a  comrade  slain  by  the  Grecians. 
Panting  and  pale  with  fear  beside  the  liiie  of  their  chariots 
Gathered  they  stood,  and  breathed  awhile.     Now  Zeus  upon  Ida, 
Rousing  himself  from  his  dream  of  love  by  the  side  of  his  consort, 
Sprang  to  his  feet,  looked  down,  and  beheld  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans; 
These  in  disordered  rout,  those  following  up  their  advantage, 
Scattering  their  rear,  and  Poseidon  himself  assisting  the  Grecians. 
Hector  too  he  beheld  on  the  plain  outstretched,  his  companions 
Sitting  around,  while  his  breath  came  thick,   and  his  senses  were 
wand'ring,  (10) 

Vomiting  blood :  for  not  by  the  feeblest  Greek  was  he  wounded. 
Pitying  beheld  him  the  Father  of  Gods  and  men ;  and  indigna?it 
Bent  upon  Hera  an  awful  frown,  while  thus  he  addressed  her : 
"This  is  thy  doing!    These  thine  arts!    Deviser  of  mischief, 
Hera  !     By  thee  is  Hector  removed  from  the  fight,  and  his  warriors 
Routed.     Sure  am  I  not  that  the  fruit  of  this  wicked  contrivance 
Thou  shalt  thyself  not  reap,  and  feel  the  scourge  of  my  anger. 
Hast  thou  forgotten  the  day  when  on  high  suspended,  with  anvils 
Slung  to  thy  feet,  I  held  thee  chained  by  the  hands,  and  in  fetters 
Golden,  infrangible,  swung  thee  aloft  'mid  clouds,  in  the  aether?    (20) 
Sore  were  the  Gods  on  Olympus'  height  distressed  when  they  saw  thee, 
Standing  around  in  dismay,  unable  to  free,  or  to  aid  thee. 


316  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

One  did  I  seize  in  my  wrath  and  dashed  him  down  from  the  threshold 
Breathless  and  bruised  to  the  earth.    Nor  yet.  was  my  anger  abated  : 
Such  were  my  grief  and  rage  at  the  woes  of  godlike  Heracles, 
Whom  thy  malignant  hate,  the  subservient  tempests  arousing, 
Chased  o'er  the  desolate  sea  by  the  aid  of  impetuous  Boreas. 
Hardly  the  Coan  shore  he  reached.    There  I  came  to  his  rescue, 
Saved  him  from  utter  destruction  and  landed  him  safely  in  Argos, 
Famed   for   its   steeds,    though   sore   distressed   and    exhausted    by 
suff'rings.  (30) 

[Then,  nor  till  then,  did  I  free  thy  feet,  and  those  ponderous  masses 
Down,  as  a  sign  to  all  future  time,  I  hurled  upon  Troia.] 
This  recal  to  thy  mind  and  abandon  thy  schemes  of  deception.  (31) 
Learn  from  this,  how  little  thy  semblance  of  love  and  affection 
Aids  thy  cause,  when  Olympus  thou  quit'st,  intent  to  beguile  me." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  a  shudder  of  dread  pervaded  the  Goddess, 
While  in  these  eager  words  of  ready  excuse  she  addressed  him : 
"  Witness,  O  Earth  !    Bear  witness,  thou  boundless  aethereal  concave  ! 
Deep-gliding  waters  of  Styx,  attest  my  words !    By  th'  immortals 
Ever  the  holiest  of  oaths  esteemed,  inviolate,  awful — 
By  thy  own  sacred  head  I  swear — by  that  which  of  all  things 
Least  would  I  lightly  invoke,  our  virgin  bed  : — Oh  !  believe  me:     (40) 
Not  by  persuasion  of  mine  doth  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon 
Harass  the  Trojans  and  Hector  and  lend  his  aid  to  the  Argives. 
Prompted  alone  by  his  own  desires  he  joins  in  the  conflict, 
Pitying  the  Greeks,  at  their  ships  attacked,  and  ready  to  perish. 
Would  he  but  hear  my  advice,  he  would  quit  the  field  and  betake  him 
Whithersoe'er  my  cloud-enshrouded  lord  may  command  him." 

Thus  she  spake,  and,  appeased,  the  Father  of  Gods  and  of  mortals 
Smiled  once  more  on  his  wife,  and  in  gentler  accents  responded : 
"Wouldst   thou   henceforward,    Hera !    my  bright-eyed    queen   and 

my  partner, 
Think  with  thy  lord,  and  support  his  pow'r  in  the  conclave  of  Heaven, 
Soon  would  the  great  Poseidon  his  proud  rebellious  behaviour  (51) 
Change,  and  adopt  the  side  by  us  both  approved  and  supported. 
If  then  the  truth  thou  speak'st,  if  really  sincere  thine  intentions, 
Join  the  assembled  synod  of  Gods,  and  summoning  Iris 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  317 

Send  her  to  me.     Send  too  the  glorious  archer,  Apollo. 
Iris  first,  to  the  host  of  the  bronze-mailed  sons  of  Achaia 
Speeding,  shall  bear  my  dread  command  to  the  Monarch  of  Ocean 
Back  to  his  waves  to  retire,  and  mix  no  more  in  the  contest. 
Hector  shall  Phoebus  Apollo  restore  to  strength  and  to  vigour, 
Soothing  the  pains  he  endures,  and  once  more  eager  for  combat  (60) 
Send  him  fresh  to  the  fight,  where  the  Greeks  in  turn  he  shall  scatter 
Headlong  in  flight;  to  panic  abandoned  and  helpless  confusion. 
Flying,  a  refuge  the  Greeks  will  seek  at  the  ships  of  Achilles, 
Peleus'  son,  who  will  send  them  his  loved  companion  Patroclus. 
Many  a  Troian  chief  by  his  hand  will  fall,  and  among  them 
Ev'n  my  own  godlike  son,  Sarpedon  himself:  until  Hector 
Stretch  beneath  Ilion's  walls  the  lifeless  corse  of  Patroclus. 
Then  shall  Achilles  rise  in  his  wrath,  and  Hector  shall  perish. 
Thenceforth,  uninterrupted  success  shall  commence  for  the  Grecians. 
Back  from  their  ships'  and  tents  shall  the  Trojans  retreat  to  their 
city:  (70) 

Iiion  at  length  shall  fall,  through  the  counsels  and  aid  of  Athene. 
This  be  assured  :  henceforth  unappeased  my  wrath  will  continue, 
Nor  will  I  suffer  one  of  the  Gods  to  give  aid  to  the  Argives 
While  of  Peleides'  prayer  one  whit  remains  unaccomplished. 
This  have  I  promised,  this  by  my  nod  confirmed,  unto  Thetis, 
On  that  eventful  day  when  my  knees  she  embraced,  and  entreated 
Vengeance  and  compensation  full  for  the  wrongs  of  Achilles." 

Thus  spake  Zeus  :  nor  did  fair-armed  Hera  withhold  her  compliance. 
Ida  she  quitted,  and  reached  the  spacious  halls  of  Olympus 
Swift  as  when  some  wayfaring  man,  rememb'ring  his  travels      (80) 
Far  over  land  and  sea,  in  his  thoughts  runs  over  the  distance : — 
'Here   was    I    now,    now   there' — each    scene   through   his  memory 

glancing  : 
Such  and  so  swift  was  the  eager  and  darting  flight  of  the  Goddess. 

Xow  in  the  halls  of  lofty  Olympus  she  stood,  where  th'  immortals 
All  assembled  she  found.     Up  rose  each  God  at  her  coming, 
Duteous,  and  welcomed  her  back  with  goblets  brimming  with  neclar. 
Themis  the  fair  alone  she  noticed,  who  hastening  to  meet  her 
Handed  a  flowing  bowl,  which  Hera  received,  while  the  Goddess 


318  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Thus  to  her  sov'reign  addressed  these  anxious  words  of  enquiry  : 
"Why  so  disturbed,  O  Hera  !  What  means  this  look  of  amazement  ?(qo) 
Say!  Hath  thy  lord,  dark  Kronos'  son,  said  aught  to  alarm  thee?" 
Thus  in  her  turn  to  Themis  the  fair-armed  Hera  responded: 
"Ask  me  not,  Themis!  well  thou  know'st  his  imperious  temper, 
How  unbending  in  spirit,  how  harsh  and  stern  in  his  conduct. 
Take  thy  place,  and  preside  o'er  the  equal  feast  of  th'  immortals. 
Then  shalt  thou  hear,  with  all  the  rest,  what  Zeus  is  preparing; 
What  an  array  of  ills  he  announces  : — such  as,  believe  me ! 
Few  of  the  Gods  or  of  men  will  be  found  to  approve,  and  to  some 

here 
Feasting   complacently  now,  will  cruelly  mar  their  enjoyment." 

Ceased  the  Goddess  august  and  her  seat  resumed,  and  amazement 
Fell  upon  all  th'  assembled  Gods:  for  a  smile,  as  of  mock'ry,         (101) 
Played  on  her  lips,  while  her  clouded  brow  seemed  fraught  with  dis- 
pleasure. 
Thus,  addressing  the  Gods,  in  indignant  words  she  harangued  them : 
"Fools  that  we  are  to  waste  on  Zeus  our  impotent  anger, 
Flatt'ring  ourselves  that  by  word  or  force  we  can  soothe  or  restrain  him ; 
Sitting  aloof  in  gloomy  state  apart  from  our  councils, 
Conscious  of  pow'r  supreme  and  transcendent  strength,  he  despises 
All  we  can  do,  nor  heeds  our  complaints,  nor  is  moved  by  our  anger. 
Therefore  endure,  as  best  ye  may,  whate'er  he  may  send  you, 
Bitter  to  bear  though  it  be,  and  take  your  example  from  Ares.       (II0) 
Slain  on  the  battle-field  Ascalaphus  lies,  his  belov'd  one, 
Dearest  of  mortal  men  to  his  heart,  and  the  boast  of  his  father." 

Thus   she  spake,   and  at  once  up  spraitg  infuriate  Ares; 
Smote   with  his  hands  on  his  stalwart  thighs,  and  wildly  addressed 

them  : 
"  Deem  not  amiss,  ye  Gods  !  that  I  quit  your  Olympian  dwelling, 
Hurrying  down  to  avenge  my  son  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Reckless  of  Zeus  and  his  wrath,  though  he  strike  me  down  with  his 

lightning, 
Hurled,  among  dust  and  blood,  on  the  heaps  of  the  dead  and  the 

dying." 
Ending,  to  Fear  and  Flight  his  command  he  issued,  his  chariot 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  319 

Quick  to  prepare,  while  himself  in  his  radiant  arms  he  invested.   (120) 

Then  on  th'  immortals  all  would  a  dire  and  terrible  vengeance 
Surely  have  fall'n  at  the  hands  of  Zeus  incensed;  but  Athene, 
Filled  with  alarm  for  herself  ajid  for  all  the  host  of  Olympus, 
Started  at  once  from  her  throne,  and  rushed  to  the  gate  ere  he  passed  it, 
Snatched  from  his  head  the  helm,  and  tore  the  shield  from  his  shoulders; 
Wrenched  from  his  pow'rful  hand  the  brazen  spear  which  it  wielded, 
Striking  it  deep  in  the  ground;  and  indignant,  thus  she  addressed  him  : 
"Ares!  furious !  insane !     Thou  art  lost! — deprived  of  thy  senses. 
Hast  thou  not  ears  to  hear?     By  shame  art  thou  wholly  abandoned? 
Hast  thou,  I  say,  not  heard  the  words  of  Hera  our  sovereign,         (130) 
Newly  come  from  Olympian  Zeus;  what  wrath  she  denounces? 
Wouldst  thou  be  hunted  back,  against  thy  will,  to  Olympus, 
Groaning  with  pain  and  bitter  despite,  yet  forced  to  obey  him ; 
Bringing  upon  us  all  the  wrath  thy  fault  hath  excited? 
Hither  in  haste  will  he  come,  and  here  will  he  vent  his  displeasure, 
Leaving  the  Greeks  and  Trojans  to  fight  it  out;  nor  distinguish 
Guilty  from  innocent:  all  will  feel  the  weight  of  his  vengeance. 
Therefore  suppress  thy  wrath  for  the  death  of  thy  son ;  and  remember, 
Mightier  by  far  than  he,  more  skilled  in  the  use  of  their  weapons, 
Time  out  of  mind  have  fall'n  and  still  must  fall.    'Tis  the  sentence 
Passed  upon  all  mankind;  nor  can  aught  avail  to  avert  it."  (I4I) 

Thus  she  spake,  and  led  to  his  throne  th'  infuriate  war-god. 
Here  now  from  the  hall  forth  beckoned  Apollo  and  Iris, 
Iris  who  bears  the  commands  of  Zeus  to  Gods  and  to  mortals. 
Both  her  summons  obeyed;  then  thus  the  Goddess  addressed  them  : 
"Zeus  requires  your  prompt  and  immediate  attendance   on  Ida; 
Thither  repair.     From  himself  ye  shall  learn  when  ye  stand  in  his 

presence 
What  are  his  high  behests.     These  fail  ye  not  to  accomplish." 
Thus  having  said,  the  Goddess  august  returned,  and  in  silence 
Seated  herself  on  her  throne.    Then  Phcebus  and  Iris  to  Ida  (150) 
Hasted,  the  nurse  of  savage  beasts  and  the  mother  of  fountains. 
Seated  they  found  the  father  on  Gargarus'  loftiest  summit, 
Round  him  a  mist  suffused  of  rich,   ambrosial  fragrance. 
Rev'rent,  the  cloud-compeller  approaching,  they  stood  in  his  presence. 


320  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

He,  with  their  prompt  attendance  pleased,  and  with  Hera's  obedience, 
Mildly  received,  them,  and  shewed  no  sign  of  wrath  or  displeasure. 
Iris  first  he  addressed,  and  this  the  commission  he  gave  her : 
"Iris!  Hie  thee  hence,  and  seek  the  monarch  Poseidon, 
All  I  tell  thee  repeat,  with  strict  and  careful  exactness. 
Bid  him  desist  from  war,  and  at  once  retire  from  the  battle,  (^o) 

Join  the  assembly  of  Gods  on  high,  or  return  to  his  ocean : 
Should  he  refuse  to  obey,  and  with  scorn  reject  my  injunction, 
Bid  him  reflect,  and  consider  it  well.     Can  he  hope  to  withstand  me 
Strong  as  he  is,  when  in perso?i  I  come,  to  compel  his  obedience? 
Bid  him  remember  too  that,  superior  in  might  and  dominion, 
Mine  is  the  right  of  elder  birth :  nor  presumptuously  boast  him 
Equal  to  Zeus,  whom  all  obey  as  their  lord  and  their  master." 

Iris  obeyed,  and  swift  as  the  winds,  from  the  mountains  of  Ida 
Darting,  alighted  at  once  near  the  sacred  city  of  Ilion. 
As  when  the  snowy  drift,  swept  on  by  the  impulse  of  Boreas        (170) 
Hurries  along,  or  the  freezing  hail,  while  the  clouds  he  disperses. 
So  pressing  on  with  eager  speed  the  swift-winged  Iris 
Close  to  Poseidon  arrived,  and  thus  delivered  her  message: 
"Dark-browed  King!  who  surround'st  the  earth  with  the  roll  of  thy 

billows : 
Hither  I  come,  with  a  message  from  ^Egis-bearing  Kronion. 
These  are  his  orders.     Desist  from  war.    Withdraw  from  the  battle. 
Join  the  assembled  Gods  on  high,   or  retire  to  thine  ocean. 
If  thou  refuse  to   obey,   and  with  scorn  reject  his  injunction, 
Hear  what  he  threatens.     Himself  will  descend  and  in  person  compel 

thee. 
Therefore  he  bids  thee  reflect  in  time,  and  avoid  his  encounter;  (180) 
Bids  thee  remember  too  that  superior  in  might  and  dominion, 
His  is  the  right  of  elder  birth;  nor  presumptuously  boast  thee 
Equal  to  Zeus,  whom  all  obey  as  their  lord  and  their  master." 
Grievously  angered,  thus  replied  the  lord  of  the  earthquake: 
"  Gods!  what  a  menace  is  this!  Thus  thinks  he  by  force  to  coerce  me, 
Strong  though  he  be,  his  equal  if  not  in  might,  yet  in  honour? 
Brethren  three  we  derive  our  birth  from  Kronos  and  Rhea, 
Zeus;  myself;  and  the  third-born,  Hades,  ruler  of  Orcus. 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  321 

All  was  divided  between  us :  and  each  in  his  share  is  a  sov'reign. 

First  to  myself  by  lot  it  fell  to  inhabit  the  ocean,  (I9°) 

Ever  supreme  in  its  hoary  depths:  In  the  region  of  darkness 

Hades  next :  Zeus  last,  in  the  clouds,  the  skies,  and  the  aether 

Earth  however  and  lofty  Olympus  are  free  and  in  common. 

Therefore  to  me  is  his  will  no  law,  be  he  never  so  mighty. 

Let  him  remain,  content,  in  his  own  allotted  dominion, 

Nor  to  base  threats  of  force  expect  me  to  yield,  like  a  coward. 

Bid  him   reserve  such  words  of  vain  and  insolent  menace 

For  his  own  sons  and  daughters  with  whom  he  hath  peopled  Olympus. 

Those  may  he  safely  threaten,  for  those  are  bound  to  obey  him. " 

Iris,  swift  as  the  winged  wind,  this  answer  returned  him :     (200) 
"Must  I  then  bear  unto  Zeus,  O  dark-browed  lord  of  the  ocean  ! 
Such  a  reply,  so  fierce,  so  unbending,  as  that  thou  hast  spoken  ? 
Surely  thou  wilt  not  persist :  thou  wilt  change  thy  mind  :  for  the  noble 
Know   when   to  yield.     And,  remember !    the    Furies   side  with  the 

elder." 
Thus  then  in  turn  replied  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon  : 
"Iris!  goddess!  thy  words  are  just:  I  know,  I  admit  it. 
Happy  it  is  when  an  envoy  perceives  the  right,  and  can  urge  it. 
Sharp  was  however  the  pang  which  pierced  the  heart  in  my  bosom 
"When  from  thy  lips  I  heard  the  rebuke  he  dares  to  address  me — 
Me!    his  equal  in  rank  nor  aught  his  inferior  in  fortunes.        (210) 
Yet  for  the  present  I  yield  and  retire,  though  justly  indignant. 
One  thing  however  I  tell  thee,  and  threat^/-  threat  thou  shalt  bear  him. 
If,  disregarding  myself  and  Athene  spoiler  of  cities, 
Hera,  Hephaestus  and  Hermes  alike  from  his  councils  excluding, 
Ilion's  lofty  towers  he  spare,  and  refuse  to  destroy  them, 
And  to  the  Greeks  deny  their  meed  of  glory  and  conquest, 
This  let  him  know,  that  implacable  hate  shall  part  us  for  ever." 

Thus  having  spoken  the  great  earth-shaker  retired  from  the  battle. 
Leaving   the   Greeks,  in   the   deep   he   plunged,  and   withdrew  his 

assistance, 
Sorely  missed  by  their  chiefs.     Then  thus  spake  Zeus  to  Apollo  :  (220) 
Haste  thee  now,  Phcebus  dear !  to  the  bronze-helmed  warrior  Hector. 
Back  to  his  waves  hath  retreated  the  world-encircling  Poseidon, 


21 


322  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Thus  having   scaped   our  threatened  and  imminent  wrath.     Had  he 

lingered 
Soon  had  the  dark  infernal  Pow'rs,  companions  of  Kronos, 
Heard  of  our  quarrel  a?id  felt  its  shock.     For  us  both  is  it  better, 
Both  for  him  and  myself,  that  angry  albeit  and  reluctant, 
Thus  from  the  field  he  retire,  nor  oblige  me  by  force  to  compel  him. 
Not  without  struggle  and  toil  severe  had  the  feat  been  accomplished. 
Bear  thou  now  on  thine  arm  this  fringed  and  terrible  JEgis  : 
This  when  thou  shak'st  the  boldest  Grecian  hero  shall  tremble.       (230) 
Hector,  O  far-darting  king,    to  thy  healing  care  is  committed; 
Fill  him  with  vigour  and  might  renewed,  that  the  Grecians  before  him 
Fly,  till  again  they  reach  their  ships  and  the  Hellespont's  margin. 
Thither  arrived,  the  word  shall  be  spoken,  the  deed  be  accomplished 
Which  shall  afford  the  Greeks  a  breathing  time  from  their  labours." 

Thus  he  spake :  and  Phoebus  obeyed  the  command  of  his  father. 
Headlong  down  like  a  hawk  from  Ida's  summit  he  darted, 
Fleetest  of  birds,  when  the  terrified  doves  are  scattered  before  him. 
Hector  divine,  great  Priam's  son,  he  found :  but  no  longer 
Stretched  on  the  ground.     Upright  he  sate,  and  his  senses  returning, 
Once  more  his  friends  he  knew.     More  freely  he  breathed  and  the 

death-sweat  (24J) 

Ceased  :  for  the  favouring  spirit  of  Zeus  had  already  revived  him. 
Standing  close  at  his  side  thus  spake  far-darting  Apollo : 
"Hector,  Priamus'  son,  why  sit'st  thou,  far  from  thy  Trojans, 
Feeble  and  drooping  of  heart?   Hath  some  misfortune  befall'n  thee?" 
Crestwaving  Hector  faintly  thus  replied  to  his  question : 
"Who  then  art  thou,  most  benign  of  Gods,  who  mak'st  the  enquiry? 
Hast  thou  not  heard  how,  fighting  before  the  sterns  of  their  vessels, 
Slaying  his  comrades  around  him  in  heaps,  impetuous  Aias 
Hurled    on   my   bosom   a   stone,  and    stopped    the    career    of  my 

valour?  (25°) 

Surely  methought  the  ghastly  dead  and  the  mansion  of  Hades 
I  should  this  very  day  have  beheld  :  for  my  soul  was  departing." 

Thus  then  replied  the  king,  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo : 
"Be  of  good  cheer;  be  strong!  for  behold,  how  great  a  supporter 
Zeus  hath  from  Ida  sent  by  thy  side  to  stand  and  to  aid  thee, 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  323 

Phoebus  Apollo,  lord  of  the  golden  sword,   who  am  ever 
Ready  at  hand  to  sustain  and  protect  thy  self  and  thy  city. 
Up  then !     Urge  on  again  the  num'rous  host  of  thy  horsemen 
At  the  full  speed  of  their  steeds  to  the  hollow  ships  of  the  Grecians  : 
I  myself  in  the  van  will  march  making  way  for  the  chariots  (260) 

Level  and  smooth,  and  turn  to  flight  the  bravest  Achaians." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  infused  in  the  prince  fresh  courage  and  vigour. 
As  when  a  courser  high  fed  and  exulting  in  pride  of  his  freedom, 
Bursting  the  rein  which  held  him  confined  to  his  stall,  o'er  the  meadows 
Bounds  forth  prancing,  eager  to  lave  in  some  wide  flowing  river 
Well  remember'd.     High  tossing  his  head,  while  the  mane  o'er  his 

shoulders 
Streams  on  the  wind,  away  he  darts  in  his  strength  and  his  beauty 
Far  o'er  the  plain,  in  the  distant  pastures  scenting  his  females. 
Thus  with  spirit  renewed,  each  limb  made  supple  and  pliant, 
Hector    advanced   once    more    to    the    charge    and   cheered   on   his 
horsemen.  (27°) 

As  when  a  rustic  band  of  men  and  dogs  in  the  woodland 
Chase  in  full  cry  some  horned  stag  or  goat  of  the  mountain, 
He  to  the  lofty  crag  or  the  tangled  gloom  of  the  thicket 
Flies,  and  eludes  their  pursuit,  not  destined  yet  to  be  taken : 
Then,  by  their  clamour  aroused,  a  bearded  lion  approaches, 
Crossing  their  way  :  reluctant  they  turn  and  fly  from  his  presence  : 
Thus  rushing  on,  the  Greeks  in  dense  tumultuous  masses 
Plied  their  swords  and  two-edged  spears,  still  smiting  the  Trojans. 
Soon  as  however  great  Hector  they  saw  rejoining  his  comrades,    (279) 
Struck  with  amaze,  their  hearts  sank  down  and  their  courage  forsook 
them. 

Thoas,  Andraemon's  son,  who  first  perceived  him,  addressed  them, 
Thoas,  valiant  in  standing  fight,  and  renowned  as  a  spearman, 
Bravest  of  all  th'  ^Etolian  leaders.     Few  in  the  council, 
Where  in  debate  the  assembled  chiefs  contend,  might  excel  him. 
Wisely  and  well  his  thoughts  he  spake,  and  thus  he  harangued  them  : 
"  Gods  !  what  wonder  is  here  ?  Can  I  trust  these  eyes  that  behold  it  ? 
Here  once  more,  defrauding  the  fates,  have  we  He6tor  among  us, 
Risen  again,  whom  we  hoped,  and  all  believed  to  have  perished 


21 


324  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Under  the  conquering  hands  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias ! 
Surely  some  favouring  pow'r  divine  must  have  saved  and  restored  him ! 
Hector  himself  we  behold,  who  hath  slain  full  many  a  Grecian  : — (291) 
— -(That  which,  methinks,  will  happen  again ;  for  not  unsupported, 
Not  without  thundering  Zeus,  comes  he  on  so  fierce  with  the  foremost.) 
All  of  you  then  who  hear  me,  attend  to  my  words  and  obey  them. 
Back  to  the  ships  let  the  vulgar  crowd  retire  at  our  bidding. 
We,  who  proclaim  our  worth  as  the  bravest  and  best  of  our  armies, 
Here  make  a  stand,  and  oppose  his  first  advance,  with  our  weapons 
Boldly  uplifted.     Well  I  ween  that,  whatever  his  fierceness, 
Scarce  will  he  dare,  so  met,  to  pierce  the  array  of  the  Grecians." 
Thus  did  he  speak  :  and  all  attentive  heard  and  obeyed  him.       (300) 
Those  around  Aias,  those  round  the  Cretan  monarch  assembled, 
Those  about  Teucer,   Merion,  and  Meges  valiant  as  Ares, 
Marshalled  in  battle  array,  the  chiefs  collecting  on  all  sides ; 
Hector  and  all  his  Troian  host  to  withstand ;  while  to  rearward 
All  of  inferior  note  retreated  back  to  the  vessels. 
On  came  the  Trojans,  pressing  in  serried  array,  with  their  leader 
Hector,  taking  gigantic  strides.     Before  him  Apollo 
Marched :  with  a  glowing  cloud  were  his  shoulders  veiled,  and  the  ^Egis 
Dreadful,  gleaming,  shaggy  with  fringes,  he  bore ;  by  Hephsestus 
Framed,  and  to  Zeus  consigned,  to  be  borne  for  the  terror  of  mortals. 
This  on  his  arm  aloft  he  raised,  while  he  headed  the  onset.  (311) 

Banded  together,  the  Greeks  stood  firm.     Shrill  echoing  on  all  sides 
Rose  from  each  host  a  shout.     Then  leaped  from  many  a  bow-string 
Shafts,  from  the  nervous  arm  of  many  a  warrior  the  jav'lins 
Flew.     Some   deep   infixed    drank  blood  from  the  young  and   the 

valiant : 
Some,  falling  short  ere  they  grazed  the  unstain'd  skin  of  a  foeman, 
Plunged  in  the  ground,  of  their  prey  defrauded,  thirsting  for  slaughter. 

Now  while  aloft  unmoved  was  the  ALgis  borne  by  Apollo, 
Equal  on  both  sides  fell  the  shafts  and  perished  the  heroes. 
But  when  full  in  the  face  of  the  Greeks  his  gaze  he  directed         (320) 
Shaking  the  ^Egis  and  shouting  a  dreadful  shout,  in  their  bosoms 
Withered  their  hearts,  and  the  pride  of  their  ancient  valour  forsook 
them. 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  325 

As  when  two  savage  wolves  coming  down  with  assault  unexpected 
Scatter  a  flock  of  sheep,  or  a  herd  of  kine  in  confusion, 
What  time  the  night  after  milking  is  dark  and  the  keepers  are  absent : 
Thus  unresisting  fled  the  Greeks,  by  Phoebus  Apollo 
Panic-smitten,  while  Hector  and  Troy  he  conducted  to  glory. 

Broken  was  now  their  line,  and  man  slew  man  in  the  tumult. 
Stichius  sank  before  Hector's  might,  and  Arcesilaiis ; 
This,  of  Boeotia's  bronze-mailed  troops  a  prince  and  a  leader,       (330) 
That,  of  Menestheus  bold  the  friend  and  faithful  companion. 
Medon  and  Iasus  yielded  their  lives  and  spoils  to  JEne&amp;s ; 
Medon,  godlike  Oileus  son  and  the  brother  of  Aias ; 
Though  of  unwedded  love  the  fruit ;  who  far  from  his  country 
Phylace  sought,  having  slain  the  brother  of  fair  Eniopis, 
Wife  of  Oileus,  and  fled  to  escape  the  wrath  of  his  father. 
Iasus  led  into  battle  the  brave  Athenian  warriors, 
Iasus,  Sphelus'  reputed  son,  and  Bucolus'  grandson, 
Next,  to  Polydamas'  spear  Mecistes  fell,  and  Polites 
Echius  slew,  as  they  fought  in  the  foremost  rank.     Then  Agenor    (340) 
Clonius  smote,  while  Paris  his  lance  through  Deiochus'  shoulder 
Drove,  as  he  turned  him  to  fly,  and  the  point  came  forth  through  his 
breast-plate. 

These  of  their  arms  were  they  stripping.     The  Greeks  meanwhile  in 
confusion 
Plunged  through  the  ditch,  and  among  the  stakes,  and  scatt'ring  on  all 

sides 
Hither  and  thither,  hard  pushed,  the  wall  they  gained  and  surmounted. 
But  with  a  loud  and  piercing  shout  great  Heel  or  indignant 
Bade  them  desist  from  spoil  and  push  forward  at  once  to  the  vessels  : 
"That  man,  whoe'er  he  be,  who  shall  hold  aloof  or  shall  linger 
Elsewhere  than  at  the  ships,  to  death  on  the  spot  will  I  doom  him. 
Nor  shall  his  kindred  or  friends  a  pyre  provide  for  his  fun'ral,       (350) 
Vultures  and  dogs  shall  tear  him  before  the  walls  of  our  city." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  lash  to  his  horses'  shoulders  applying 
Urged  them  to  speed,  and  called  on  the  Troian  warriors  to  follow ; 
They  with  a  general  shout  replied.     Whirled  on  by  their  coursers 
Rattled  the  cars,  while  Phoebus  Apollo,  striding  before  them, 


326  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Crushed  down  the  banks  of  the  trench  profound,  and  spumed  them 

in  ruin 
Into  its  hollow  depths,  and  bridged  it  across  with  a  causeway- 
Long,  and  in  breadth  so  far  as  the  utmost  flight  of  a  jav'lin, 
When  for  a  trial  of  strength  some  stalwart  spearman  hath  hurled  it, 
O'er  it  they  rushed,  troop  following  troop,  and  before  them  Apollo  (360) 
Bore  up  the  precious  JEgis  on  high,  and  levelled  the  rampart ; 
Brushing  it  down,  as  a  child  at  play  on  the  sand  of  the  sea-shore, 
Tired  of  his  sport,  tf/"the  lines  he  has  drawn,  the  heaps  he  has  gathered, 
Easily  sweeps  them  away  with  his  hands  and  feet,  and  destroys  them ; 
Thus  did'st  thou  sweep  aside,  O  immortal  Archer !    in  ruin 
All  the  huge  toil  of  the  Greeks,  and  themselves  disperse  in  confusion. 
Thus  they  remained,  penned  up  at  their  ships,  each  man  on  his 

comrade 
Calling  in  vain  for  aid;   and  to  all  the  pow'rs  of  Olympus 
Raising  their  hands  in  suppliant  guise,  they  prayed  for  deliv'rance. 
Chief  of  them  all,  the  guardian  of  Greece,  Gerenian  Nestor,    (370) 
Spread  forth  his  hands  to  the  starry  skies,  and  preferred  his  petition : 
"Father  Zeus,  if  e'er  one  Greek  ere  Argos  we  quitted 
Thigh  of  the  bull  or  fat  of  the  sheep  hath  burned  on  thine  altars, 
Praying  a  safe  return,  and  thou  gav'st  assent  and  confirm'dst  it ; 
Now  that  promise  recall  to  thy  mind,  dread  lord  of  Olympus  ! 
Ward  off  the  evil  day,  nor  suffer  our  foes  to  o'envhelm  us." 
Such  his  petition,  by  Zeus  received :  and  he  answered  in  thunder, 
Hearing  and  granting  the  prayer  of  the  rev'rend  offspring  of  Neleus. 
Meanwhile  the  Trojans,  who  heard  the  sign,  mistaking  its  import, 
Summoned  fresh  spirit,  and  pressed  the  Greeks  more  fiercely  than 

ever.  (380) 

As  when  a  wave  high  swol'n  by  the  wind  on  the  wide-flowing  ocean, 
(Such  as  a  tempest's  force  may  raise)  sweeping  on  in  its  fury, 
Breaks,  and  descends  with  a  mighty  crash  on  the  sides  of  a  vessel ; 
Thus  did  the  Trojans  sweep  with  terrific  shouts  o'er  the  rampart. 
Onward  their  horses  and  cars  they  drove  to  the  sterns  of  the  vessels. 
There  with  two-edged  spears  they  closed  in  fight     While  the  Trojans 
Fought  from  their   chariots,  the  Greeks,  their   black-ribbed   vessels 

ascending, 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  327 

Plied  them  with  huge  long  pikes,  well  spliced,  bronze-headed,  and  ready- 
Stowed  in  their  ships  for  defence,  when  close  assault  should  demand 
them. 

Now    while    the    Trojans    and    Greeks    outside    the    wall    were 
contending  (39°) 

Far  from  the  ships,  in  the  tent  of  his  friend  still  lingered  Patroclus. 
Valiant  Eurypylus  kindly  tending  he  sate,  and  with  converse 
Cheered  him,  from  time  to  time  to  his  wound  fresh  balsams  applying, 
Such  as  might  soothe  and  assuage  its  black,  unendurable  anguish. 
But  when  the  Trojans  he  saw  surmounting  the  wall,  and  the  Argives 
Flying  in  terror,  and  heard  their  cries,  and  the  shouts  of  the  viclors, 
Loudly  he  groaned,  and  smote  with  his  hands  on  his  thighs,  and 

upstarting, 
Deeply  moved,  with  these  hurried 'words  took  leave  of  his  comrade: 
"Sore  though  thy  need,  my  friend  !  at  thy  side  no  more  may  I  linger, 
Hence  must  I  haste,  for  behold  !  how  fierce  a  struggle  is  raging.  (400) 
Thee  to  thy  servants'  care  must  I  leave,  and  hence  to  Achilles 
Pass  with  all  speed,  and  exhort  him,  at  length,  to  join  in  the  conflict. 
Who    can   say,  whether,   aided   by  heav'n,    my  words  may  arouse 

him 
Zealously  urged,  for  a  friend's  advice  is  strong  and  persuasive." 

Thus,  still  speaking,  he  ran  from  the  tent.     Meanwhile  the  Achaians 
Sternly  resisted  the  Trojan  assault;  yet  availed  not  to  drive  them, 
Fewer  albeit,  from  the  ships  which  they  strove  to  reach;  nor  the  Trojans, 
Fierce  as  they  were,  might  break  through  the  phalanx  firm  of  the  Argives, 
Mix  with  their  tents  and  ships,  and  spread  destruclion  among  them. 
As  when  with  line  and  rule  some  plank  by  a  shipwright  is  fitted  (410) 
Sure  of  hand  and  exacl  of  eye,  by  Pallas  Athene 
Taught,  and  in  all  the  lore  of  his  craft  well  skilled  and  accomplished: 
Thus  with  an  even  front  was  the  line  of  their  battle  adjusted. 

Some  before  one  ship  fought,  some  gathered  in  arms  round  another  : 
Hector  on  Aias  advanced,  disdaining  a  feebler  opponent. 
Both  at  one  ship  their  efforts  plied;  nor  could  ^Hector  accomplish 
Aught  to  thrust  Aias  aside  and  burn  his  ship,  nor  could  Aias 
Drive  great  Hector  away;  for  a  God  supported  his  onset. 

Foremost  Caletor,  Clytius'  son,  with  fire  was  approaching ; 


328  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Him  through  the  breast  great  Aias  pierced;   and  he  fell,  and  his 

armour  (420) 

Clattered;    and   drop't   on   the  ground,   the   smould 'ring  torch   was 

extinguished. 
Hector,  who  witnessed  with  grief  his  cousin's  fate,  and  beheld  him 
Stretched  at  his  length  in  the  dust,  before  the  stem  of  the  vessel, 
Called  on  the  Trojan  and  Lycian  hosts,  and  shouting  addressed  them : 
"Trojans,  and  Lycians  all !  and  brave  Dardanian  warriors, 
Stand  to  your  arms,  nor  abandon  the  fight  for  a  moment  of  hardship  ; 
Clytius'  son,  'tis  true,  hath  fall'n  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
On  then  !  defend  his  corse,  nor  suffer  the  foe  to  despoil  him." 
Thus  he  spake;  and  at  Aias  hurled  his  glittering  jav'lin; 
Wide  of  its  mark  it  erred,  yet  struck  the  attendant  of  Aias,    (430) 
Lycophron,  Mastor's  son,  in  Cythera  bred,  who  to  Aias 
Fled,  from  the  land  of  his  birth,  having  slain  a  noble  Cytheran. 
Standing  at  Aias'  side,  he  received  the  spear  through  his  helmet, 
Piercing  above  the  ear;  then  down  from  the  stern  of  the  vessel 
Headlong  he  plunged  in  the  dust,  and  lay  supine  in  his  death-pang. 
Then  over  Aias  a  shudder  crept,  and  he  called  to  his  brother : 
"Teucer!  beloved  of  my  soul!  we  have  lost  our  faithful  companion 
Mastor's  son,  of  Cythera,  so  long  the  guest  of  our  household, 
Cherished  with  hardly  less  than  a  parent's  love,  in  our  palace.      (439) 
Him  hath  the  mighty  Hector  slain !     Where,  where  are  thine  arrows 
Piercifig  and  swift,  and  thy  bow,  that  gift  of  Phcebus  Apollo?" 
Thus  he  spake  :  and  prompt  at  his  word  stood  Teucer  beside  him, 
Bearing  his  bended  bow,  and  with  store  of  shafts  in  his  quiver, 
Which  with  no  tardy  hand  he  dealt  abroad  on  the  Trojans. 
Cleitus  received  the  first,  the  valiant  son  of  Pisenor, 
Who  on  Polydamas,  Panthous'  noble  son,  was  attending. 
Holding  the  reins,  intent  on  his  task  of  guiding  his  horses 
Into  the  thickest  press,  where  fiercest  the  combat  was  raging, 
Bringing  the  Trojans  and  Hector  a  welcome  support.      Unexpected, 
Down     came    the     mischief    which    none    might    avert,    however 

desirous.  (45°) 

Straight  through  his  neck  from  behind  went  the  deadly  shaft.     From 

the  chariot 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  329 

Headlong  down  on  the  ground  he  fell.  Back  started  the  coursers, 
Rattling  along  the  empty  car.  When  he  saw  what  had  happened 
Up  rushed  Polydamas  quickly,  and  stopped  the  flight  of  the  horses, 
And  to  Astynous,  brave  Protiaon's  son,  he  consigned  them, 
Strictly  enjoining  him  ever  to  keep  him  in  sight,  and  be  near  him  : 
Then  flew  back  to  the  ranks,  and  mixed  once  more  in  the  combat. 

Next  at  the  bronze-helm'd  Hector  himself  was  an  arrow  by  Teucer 
Aimed.    That  shaft  had  stopped  his  career,  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Valiantly  fighting,  and  ta'en  his  life  in  the  blaze  of  his  glory,        (460) 
But  that  all-provident  Zeus  the  danger  perceived,  and  protected 
Hector,  nor  graced  with  a  triumph  like  that  Telamonian  Teucer. 
Just  as  he  drew  the  bow  the  well-twisted  chord  in  the  middle 
Snapped,  and  the  brazen-pointed  shaft  flew  wide  of  its  errand. 
Blameless  till  then,  down  dropped  the  bow  from  the  hand  of  its  master. 
Then  came  a  shudder  o'er  Teucer,  and  thus  he  exclaimed  to  his  brother: 
"Surely  some  God  intervenes,  and  defeats  our  plans,  and  our  fighting 
Thwarts :    he    it   is   who    hath    dashed    from    my   hands    the   bow 

I  relied   on, 
Breaking  the  string  too,  newly  twined,  which  I  fitted  this  morning, 
Knotting  it  fast,  to  enforce  the  spring  of  many  an  arrow."      (470) 

Thus  making  answer  returned  the  great  Telamonian  Aias  : 
"Patiently  bear  it,  my  friend  !     Thy  bow  forego  and  thine  arrows. 
Lay  them  aside,  since,  envious  of  Greece,  some  God  interdicts  them. 
Handle    once   more   thy  long  sharp  spear,   and  the   shield  o'er  thy 

shoulders 
Brace.      Thus    armed,    the    Trojans    confront,    and    encourage   thy 

comrades. 
Not  without  struggle  and  toil,  if  at  length  indeed  they  subdue  us, 
Now   shall    they   capture    our   well-benched    ships,    if  we    summon 

our  courage." 
Thus  spake  Aias.     And  Teucer  dispatched  his  bow  and  his  quiver 
Back  to  his  tent,  and  a  fourfold  buckler  slung  o'er  his  shoulders, 
Placed  on  his  valiant  head  his  helm  of  proof,  with  a  horse-tail     (480) 
Crested,  and  dreadfully  nodded  the  waving  plume  o'er  his  temples : 
Grasped  in  his  hand  the  pond'rous  lance,  bronze-headed  and pointed. 
Then,  full  armed,  he  resumed  his  place  by  the  side  of  his  brother. 


330  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Teucer's  disabled  bow  escaped  not  the  notice  of  Hector. 
Shouting  aloud  to  the  Trojan  and  Lycian  hosts  he  addressed  them : 
"  Trojans  and  Lycians  brave  !  ye  Dardans  who  close  with  your  foemen  | 
Stand  to  your  arms  like  men,  and  remember  your  prowess  and  valour 
Here  at  the  hollow  ships.     Just  now — with  these  eyes  I  beheld  it — 
One  of  our  bravest  foes  is  by  Zeus  deprived  of  his  weapons. 
Easy  it  is  to  trace  the  directing  hand  of  Kronion.  (49°) 

These  with  favour  he  views,  and  crowns  with  conquest  and  glory ; 
Those  he  defeats,  and  withers  their  strength,  refusing  to  aid  them. 
Now  on  our  side  he  wars,  and  depresses  the  force  of  the  Argives. 
Fight  then  !     Rush  on  to  the  ships  in  crowds  !     And  whoever  among 

you, 
Smitten  with  arrow  or  spear,  shall  die  the  death  of  a  soldier, 
Fall  though  he  may,  unhonoured  he  sinks  not,  slain  for  his  country. 
Freed  by  his  fall  his  wife  he  leaves  and  his  children  in  safety, 
All  that  his  heart  holds  dear;  his  home ;  his  wealth :  when  the  Grecians 
Back  with  their  ships  shall  have  fled,  to  the  dear-loved  land  of  their 
fathers." 

Thus    he    spake,    in   each    heart    fresh    strength    and    courage 
arousing.  (5°°) 

Aias  next,  on  the  Greeks'  behalf,  exhorted  his  comrades  : 
"Argives  !    for  shame  !    What !  see  you  not  that  now  we  must  perish, 
Or  by  hard  fighting  our  ships  and  lives  redeem  from  destruction  ? 
Think  ye  on  foot  to  return  to  your  homes,  should  crest-waving  Hector 
Ravage  your  fleet  ?  and  to  reach  dry-shod  the  land  of  your  fathers  ? 
Hear  ye  not  Hector's  shouts — how  he  cheers  on  his  hosts,  how  he 

threatens, 
Raging,  to  wrap  your  vessels  in  one  vast  blaze  and  consume  them  ? 
'Tis  to  no  festive  dance,  but  to  battle  and  death,  that  he  calls  them. 
Nought  for  us  now  remains,  no  course,  no  option  is  left  us 
But  to  rush  at   them   with    might  and    main,    and  grapple  them 
bravely.  (510) 

Better  by  far  to  decide  at  once,  or  to  live,  or  to  perish, 
Than  to  be  wasted  slowly  down,  worn  out  in  a  struggle 
Long  protracted,  with  feebler  men,  in  defence  of  our  vessels." 

Thus  he  spake  :  in  each  heart  fresh  force  and  courage  inspiring. 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  331 

Schedius  then,  Perimedes'  son,  who  led  the  Phoceans, 
Fell  by  great  Hector's  hand ;  and  Laodamas,  son  of  Antenor, 
Leading  a  band  of  foot,  met  death  from  the  jav'lin  of  Aias. 
Next  to  Polydamas  fell  the  spoils  of  Cyllenian  Otus, 
Chief  of  the  brave  Epeans,  Phyleides'  friend  and  companion. 
Meges  at  once  on  the  victor  rushed,  but  Polydamas  stooping      (520) 
Glided  aside,  and  he  missed  his  blow :  nor  suffered  Apollo 
Panthous'  son  to  be  thus  struck  down.     But  the  jav'lin  of  Meges 
Held  on  its  course,  and  full  upon  Crcesmus'  breast  it  alighted. 
Down  with  a  crash  he  fell,  and  his  arms  were  the  spoil  of  the  victor 
Dolops  however,  a  spearman  bold,  rushed  on  to  avenge  him; 
Offspring   of   Lampus   the   brave   and   the   good,  and   Laomedon's 

grandson, 
Skilled  in  all  feats  of  arms  and  inured  to  martial  adventure. 
Close  upon  Phyleus'  son  he  advanced  and  full  on  his  buckler 
Smote  ;  and  the  spear  went  through,  but  a  corslet  of  proof  was  be- 
neath it 
Strongly  compact;  in  its  hollow  swell :  by  Phyleus  his  father         (530) 
Borne,  when  from  Ephyre's  land  he  returned,  and  the  banks  of  Selleis 
This,  as  a  parting  pledge  to  his  guest,  the  royal  Euphetes 
Gave,  to  be  worn  as  a  sure  defence  and  protection  in  battle. 
Now  it  preserved  the  son,  as  erst  it  protected  his  father. 
Meges  in  turn  delivered  his  spear,  which  full  on  his  helmet 
Lighting,  just  at  the  base  of  the  tow'ring  crest  that  above  it 
Floated  in  plumy  pride,  all  glowing  with  brass  and  with  purple, 
Shore  it  away.     In  the  dust  it  fell,  disfigured  and  trampled. 
Meges,  assured  of  success,  for  a  fresh  assault  was  preparing, 
When  to  his  aid  Menelaiis  came,  unseen  by  the  Trojan  (54°) 

Sidelong  advancing,  and  thrust  from  behind  his  spear  through  his 

shoulder. 
Holding  on  its  impetuous  way,  at  his  bosom  it  issued, 
Far  outstanding  in  front.     On  his  face  he  fell,  and  the  victors 
Both  sprang  forward  at  once,  the  resplendent  prize  of  his  armour 
Eager  to  seize.     Then  Hector  aloud  to  his  brethren  and  kindred 
Called,  invoking  their  aid  :  but  chief,  at  the  brave  Melanippus 
Pointed  his  eager  rebuke,  Hicetaon's  son.     At  Percote 


332  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Erst,  while  the  foe  was  far  away,  he  pastured  his  oxen  ; 

But  when  the  Greeks  in  their  well-trimmed  ships  invaded  his  nation 

Home    he    returned,    and    in    Ilion    dwelt,    as    a    prince    of   the 

Trojans  (550) 

Lodged  in  the  palace  of  Priam,  and  loved  like  one  of  his  children. 
Chafing,  in  words  of  rebuke  thus  Hector,  naming,  addressed  him: 
"Shall  we  be  thus  remiss,  Melanippus?     Is  not  thy  bosom 
Stirred  at  the  sight  of  thy  kinsman's  fall  ?    Oh  !  say,  can'st  thou  calmly 
Stand  and  look  on  while  These  from  his  corse  are  tearing  his  armour  ? 
Follow  me  then.     Now,  once  for  all  must  we  close  with  the  Argives, 
Slay  them  outright,   or  consent  to  behold  our  Ilion    captured, 
Hurled  from  her  lofty  height  in  the  dust,  and  her  citizens  slaughtered." 
Ending  he  led  the  assault,  by  that  godlike  warrior  followed. 
Then  in  his  turn  exhorted  the  Greeks  Telamonian  Aias  :  (560) 

"  Shew  yourselves  men,  my  friends  !     Respect  yourselves  and  each 

other ! 
Fighting  for  life  and  fame,  let  each  be  to  each  an  example. 
Safety  by  valour  alone  is  secured,   and  mutual  reliance. 
Honour  and  life  they  alike  desert  who  fly  from  the  combat." 
Thus  while  he  spake,  each  arm  gained  strength  for  a  sterner  resistance, 
Each  treasured  up  in  his  bosom  the  words  :  and  there  grew  round  the 

vessels 
Gath'ring,  a  bulwark  of  brass  :  while  Zeus  encouraged  the  Trojans. 
Then  Menelaus  Antilochus  sought,  and  thus  he  addressed  him : 
" Noble  Antilochus  !  where  shall  we  find  a  youth  in  our  armies 
Stronger,  more  swift  of  foot,  than  thyself,  or  braver  in  battle?       (570) 
Couldst  thou  not  make  a  spring   and   surprise  some  chief  of  the 

Trojans?" 
Thus  he  spake,  and  retired.    But  with  soul  excited  the  hero 
Forth  with  a  bound  to  the  van  advanced,  and  glancing  around  him 
Darted  his  gleaming  lance.     Then  back  retreating,  the  Trojans 
Shrank   from    the  weapon,  which  flew  not  in   vain   from  the  hand 

of  its  master; 
Brave  Melanippus  it  struck,  Hicetaon's  son,  who  with  Heclor 
Came  rushing  on  to  the  fight,  beneath  the  pap  through  his  breastplate. 
Down  wTith  a  crash  he  fell,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him : 


Book  XV.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


333 


Forth    sprang   the   victor,   as   springs   some   dog   on  a  fawn  which 

the  hunter, 
Just  leaping  forth  from  his  lair,  hath  pierced  to  the  heart  with   an 

arrow  (5  So) 

Sent  from  afar,  and  stretched  him  on  earth,  arrested  and  lifeless  : 
Thus  on  thy  corse,  Melanippus  !  Antilochus  sprang,  to  despoil  thee, 
Eager,  intent  on  his  prey :  but  'scaped  not  the  notice  of  Hector. 
On,  through  the  thick  of  the  fight,  infuriate,  he  rushed  to  avenge  him. 
But  when  Antilochus  saw  him,  he  feared,  nor  awaited  his  onset, 
Brave  as  he  was ;  but  like  some  wild  beast,  that,  conscious  of  mischief, 
Flies,  having  slain  some  dog  or  herdsman  in  charge  of  his  oxen, 
Off  to  his  woods,  ere  the  hue  and  cry  can  be  raised  to  pursue  him  : 
Thus  in  dismay  fled  Nestor's  son.     But  the  Trojans  and  Hector 
After  him  poured  a  tumultuous  storm  of  jav'lins  and  arrows  ;        (590) 
Nor  did  he  venture  to  turn  till  safe  in  the  ranks  of  his  comrades. 

On  came  the  Trojans  now,  like  raw-devouring  lions 
Pressing  towards  the  ships  :  for  the  high  behests  of  Kronion 
Gave  them  unwonted  strength,  and  filled  them  with  spirit  and  courage, 
While  he  enfeebled  the  Greeks  and  dimmed  their  visions  of  glory. 
Such  was  his  will.     Great  Hector  now,  with  glory  and  conquest 
Crown'd,  must  involve  in  devouring  flames  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Fierce,  destructive ;  and  all  that  Thetis  prayed  be  accomplished, 
Howsoe'er  ill-tim'd  and  severe  :  while  he  waited  the  moment 
When  from  a  single  ship  the  blaze  should  ascend,  as  a  signal,       (600) 
Then  would  he  drive  the  Trojans  back,  in  retreat,  from  the  vessels. 
Then  should  commence  for  Greece  a  career  of  glory  and  conquest. 

This  in  his  mind  revolving,  he  roused  the  spirit  of  Hector, 
Urging  him  on  to  the  ships  :  though  no  such  prompting  he  needed. 
Raging,  like  Ares,  with  brandish'd  spear,  or  as  when  in  the  mountain 
Rages  a  fire  in  the  close-entangled  depths  of  their  forests, 
Foaming   with   wrath   he  advanced.      From   beneath   the   gloom    of 

his  eyebrows 
Flashed  his  dilated  eyes ;  and  the  waving  crest  o'er  his  temples 
Dreadfully  nodded  on  high  from  the  beaming  casque  of  the  hero. 
Zeus  from  his  heav'nly  height  himself  stood  forth  his  supporter,    (610) 
One,  from  so  many,  on  that  great  day  selected  for  glory ; 


334  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Honoured  at  least,  if  not  long-lived.     For  now  over  Hector 
Near  impended  the  fateful  day  by  Pallas  Athene 
Ruthlessly  urged,  when  by  stern  Peleides'  wrath  he  should  perish. 
Now  on  the  densest  foes  he  rushed,  determined  to  break  them, 
Seeking  the  point  where  closest  the  ranks,  completest  their  armour  : 
Vainly  :  though  fieixe  the  assault,  yet  not  less  fierce  the  resista?ice. 
Locked  in  a  square,  compact  they  stood,  like  a  cliff  that  projecting 
Lofty  and  huge,  looks  down  on  the  hoary  sea  that  surrounds  it : 
Which   nor   the   shrill-voiced   winds   in   their  wild   career,  nor   the 

billows  (620) 

Roaring  around  with  impetuous  swell,  can  move  from  its  basis. 
Thus  did  the  Argives  hold  their  ground,  nor  shrink  from  the  Trojans. 
Hector  the  while  all-dazzling  in  splendour,  full  on  their  phalanx 
Rushed,   dashing   in   on   the   ranks,  like   a  wave   which   raised   by 

the  tempest 
Cloud-like  impending,  bursts  upon  some  swift  ship,  and  o'erwhelms  it, 
Sweeping  its  deck  with  spray ;  while  the  blast  in  its  hurricane  fuiy 
Screams   through   its   masts  and  shrouds.      Then   quails   the   heart 

of  the  sailor, 
Shudd'ring  to  feel  how  near  to  the  verge  of  death  he  approaches. 
Such  misgiving  invaded  the  shrinking  hearts  of  the  Argives. 
He — as  a  lion  comes  rushing  in  rage  upon  thousands  of  cattle  (630) 
Grazing  in  some  wide-watered  and  swampy  mead,  by  a  herdsman 
Tended,  who,  all  inexpert  to  meet  such  dreadful  encounter, 
And  from  the  rav'ning  beast  to  protect  his  charge,  to  the  foremost 
Now,  and  now  to  the  hindmost  (iincertaiii  to  lead  or  to  drive  the?n), 
Runs  to  and  fro  :  meanwhile,  from  their  very  midst  has  the  monster 
Snatched   and   devour'd   his  prey,  while  the  rest  fly  wild  o'er  the 

pasture — 
— Thus  dashed  in.     Then,  heav'n-confounded,  they  broke,  and  to 

Hector 
Yielded,  and  Zeus.     All  fled.     But  he  slew  the  Mycenian  hero, 
Great  Periphetes,  whose  father,  Copreus,  sent  by  Eurystheus, 
Sped  on  a  mission  of  royal  concern  to  the  might  of  Heracles.       (640) 
Worthier  by  far  than  the  sire  was  the  noble  son,  in  whom  valour 
Blended  with  every  manly  grace :  alike  in  the  battle, 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  335 

Or  in  the  race,  or  for  sage  advice  distinguished  in  council. 
Great  as  he  was,  his  death  but  increased  the  glory  of  Hector. 
Turning  him  round,  he  tripped  behind  on  the  rim  of  his  buckler, 
Which  to  his  feet  descending,  from  spears  protected  his  ancles, 
Stumbling  and  hampered  he  fell,  and  lay  supine,  and  his  helmet 
Rang,  as  it  struck  the  ground,  round  the  prostrate  warrior's  temples. 
Hector  beheld,  and  ran  to  the  spot,  and  over  him  standing, 
Drove    through    his    breast    his    vengeful    spear,    in    sight    of   his 

comrades.  (650) 

Mourning  they  witnessed  the  deed,  yet  nought  could  do  to  assist  him  : 
Such  was  the  terror  inspired  by  the  godlike  presence  of  Hector. 
Now  they  beheld  around  them  the  foremost  tier  of  the  vessels, 
Those   most   advanced   on   the   beach,   with   their   tow'ring    sterns, 

when  the  Trojans 
Poured  in  amain.     From  these  perforce  retreated  the  Argives. 
Gath'ring  before  the  tents  they  rallied  anew,  and  collected 
Stood,  nor  dispersed  through  the  camp :  for  shame  restrained  them 

and  honour: 
Fear  itself  compelled  them  to  fight.     Each  exhorted  the  other 
Shouting.     Gerenian  Nestor,  the  guardian  and  stay  of  Achaia 
Chief,  by  his  parents  adjuring  each,  besought  and  entreated :    (660) 
"  Shew  yourselves   men,    dear  friends !     Let  mutual  rev'rence   and 

honour 
Reign  in  your  noble  hearts.     Oh !  think,  each  one,  on  your  children, 
Think  on  your  wives,   your  homes;  remember  your  parents  whom 

living, 
Yet  may  your  valour  illustrate,  or,  dead,  your  defeat  may  dishonour. 
Fancy,  though  absent,    through  me   they   speak,   through  me   they 

beseech  you, 
Bravely  to  stand,  and  maintain  the  fight :  nor  think  of  retreating." 

Thus  he  spake,  fresh  courage  and  strength  in  each  bosom  arousing . 
Then  from  their  eyes  Athene  swept  the  cloud  that  involved  them, 
Low'ring  portentous.     A  flood   of  light   streamed   bright   o'er  the 

armies. 
Full  on  the  ships  it  shone  and  the  scene  of  mutual  destruction;    (670) 
Hector  here  they  beheld  with  shouts  exciting  his  warriors ; 


336  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

There,  in  the  rear,  the  fugitive  Greeks  o'erlaboured  and  fainting; 
There  again,  those  who  still  maintained  their  ground  at  the  vessels. 

Aias'  indignant  spirit  endured  not  idly  to  loiter, 
Nor  could  he  bear  to  be  seen  with  Greeks  who  withdrew  from  the 

combat, 
But  with  gigantic  strides  along  the  decks  of  the  vessels. 
Stalked,  and  a  pole  two-and-twenty  cubits  in  length,  and  with  iron 
Studded  and  bound,  for  the  ship's  defence,  he  brandished  around  him. 
And  as  some  agile  rider  in  vaulting  expert,  who  selecting 
Four  train'd  steeds   from    the  countless  herds  that  range   o'er  the 

pastures,  (680) 

Drives  them  along  the  public  road  to  some  populous  city: 
All  who  behold  him,  women  and  men  in  delighted  amazement, 
Gaze,  as  he  springs  from  steed  to  steed,  still  lighting  in  safety, 
Firm  in  his  shifted  seat,  nor  arrests  their  flight  for  an  instant: 
Thus  leaped  Aias  from  deck  to  deck  through  the  range  of  the  vessels, 
Springing  across ;  while  his  thund'ring  shouts  ascended  to  heaven, 
Ever  with  dreadful  voice  exhorting  the  Greeks  to  endurance, 
And  for  their  ships  and  tents  to  strike.     Nor  did  Hector  on  his  part 
Hold  himself  back  within  the  ranks  of  the  corseleted  Trojans, 
But  as  the  fiery  eagle  comes  rushing  down  on  his  quarry,       (690) 
Scatt'ring  dismay  through  the  nations  of  widewing'd  birds  that  assemble, 
Geese,  or  cranes,  or  long-neck'd  swans,  on  the  banks  of  a  river: 
Hector  thus,  with  a  swoop  on  the  dark-pro  wed  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Rushing  advanced,  for  Zeus  with  a  mighty  hand  and  with  power 
Drove  him  along,  and  inspired  his  troops  with  courage  to  follow. 
Then  was  the  fight  renewed  in  all  its  rage  round  the  vessels, 
Such  and  so  fierce  that,  newly  armed  mid  unwearied  with  warfare, 
One  looking  on  might  deem  them  but  just  engaging  in  battle. 
These  were  the  thoughts  of  either  host :  despairing,  the  Grecians 
Fancied  that  all  was  lost — that  nought  remained  but  to  perish.     (700) 
Confident  hope  in  each  Trojan  breast  prevailed  that  the  vessels 
Now  they  should  surely  burn,  anal  slay  ev'ry  man  of  the  Argives. 
Such  were  their  hopes  and  fears  as  they  closed  once  more  in  the 

struggle. 
Hector,  advancing  in  front,  had  seized  on  the  stern  of  a  vessel 


Book  XV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  337 

Beauteous  and  swift;  the  same  which  hapless  Protesilaiis 
Bore  to  the  Ilian  shore:  not  fated  to  Greece  to  restore  him. 
Round  it  gathered  the  Trojans  and  Greeks  in  furious  encounter. 
Hand  to  hand  they  engaged;  and  the  flying  spear  and  the  arrow, 
Now  no  longer  at  distance  awaiting,  closed  with  each  other, 
All  alike  with  one  eager  desire  for  mutual  slaughter  (710) 

Burning.     With  axes  heavy  and  keen  they  fought,  and  with  hatchets, 
Wielding  enormous  swords,  and  thrusting  with  two-edged  lances. 
Many  a  good  blade,  darkhilted,  with  guard  of  proof,  bright  gleaming, 
Struck  from  the  hand  that  bore  it,  or  lopped  with  its  arm  from  the 

shoulder, 
Glittered  in  dust,  and  with  streaming  blood  the  ground  was  impurpled. 
Hector  when  now  he  had  reached  the  ship,  with  the  grasp  of  a  viclor 
Seizing  its  stern,  held  on,  and  thus  exhorted  the  Trojans : 
"Now  bring  fire!  and  raise,  one  and  all,  the  shout  of  destruction ! 
Now  is  the  day  of  days  arrived,  which  Zeus  hath  vouchsafed  us! 
Now   shall   we   take   these    ships   which   such   countless    evils  have 

brought  us,  (72°) 

Not  by  heav'n's  will,  but  the  craven  fears  of  the  dotards  in  Troia, 
Who  to  this  hour  have  withheld  me  and  damped  the  zeal  of  my 

warriors, 
Longing  to  close  with  the  Greeks,  and  attack  them  here  at  their  vessels. 
Or,  if  the  will  of  Zeus  then  blinded  our  sense  and  deceived  us, 
This  day  at  least  he  adopts  our  cause,  and  leads  us  to  conquest." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  they  all  more  fiercely  rushed  on  the  Argives. 
Aias  himself  gave  back,  o'erwhelmed  with  darts  and  with  lances, 
Some  small  space  he  retreated;  for  death  he  thought  was  approaching. 
Quitting  the  deck,  on  the  sev'n-foot  step  he  stood,  and  around  him 
Watchful  gazed,  with  his  spear  keeping  off  each  daring  assailant  (730) 
Who  with  devouring  fire  approached  the  ship,  and  unceasing 
Thus  in  a  terrible  voice  adjured  the  sons  of  Achaia : 
"Friends  and  heroes  of  Greece  !  ye  valiant  servants  of  Ares  ! 
Shew  yourselves  men,  and  forget  not  your  ancient  prowess  and  virtue  ! 
"Where  can  we  look  behind  for  aid  or  friends  to  assist  us? 
Where  in  our  front  is  rampart  or  wall  to  afford  us  protection? 
City  or  fortress  with  tow'rs  begirt  have  we  none  to  retreat  to, 


338  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XV. 

Where  we  may  look  for  the  aid  of  faithful  allies  to  support  us. 
Far  from  our  native  land  we  hold  but  this  beach,  and  in  Troia 
Nought  we  behold  but  banded  foes,  in  arms  to  oppose  us ;  (740) 

And  to  ourselves  alone  must  look,  nor  flinch  from  the  struggle." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  with  might  and  main  he  charged  with  his  jav'lin 
All.     Whosoe'er  approached  with  blazing  brands  or  with  torches 
Armed,  to  consume  the  ships  and  accomplish  the  orders  of  Hector, 
Rushed  upon  certain  death  from  the  long,  sharp  weapon  of  Aias ; 
Twelve   on   the   spot   thus  slain   lay  stretched  at  the  stern  of  his 
vessel.

Argument. 


Patroclus  obtains  permission  to  lead  the  Myrmidons  to  the  aid  of 
the  Greeks,  and  to  appear  at  their  head  in  the  arms  of  Achilles,  o?i 
condition  of  contenting  himself  with  repulsing  the  enemy  from  the  ships 
and  abstaining  frojjt  pursuing  the7n  beyond  the  walls.  Achilles  offers  a 
libation,  and  harangues  the  Myr?nidons,  who  march  to  battle,  just  in  time 
to  prevent  the  coiiflagration  of  the  fleet.  The  Trojans  taking  Patrochis 
for  Achilles  fly  in  dismay.  He  pursties  them  with  great  slaughter.  He 
slays  Sarpedoji,  whose  body  is  rescued  by  Heclor  and  Glducus,  and  borne 
away  by  Sleep  and  Death  to  Lycia.  Patroclus  forgetful  of  his  promise, 
pursues  the  Trojans  to  their  walls,  which  he  attempts  to  scale,  but  is  driven 
back  by  Apollo.  He  engages  Heclor  and  slays  Cebriones  his  charioteer. 
In  the  fight  over  his  body  Apollo  strikes  and  disarms  Patroclus,  who  is 
first  wounded  by  Euphorbus  and  then  slain  by  Heclor. 


ILIAD.     BOOK   XVI. 


PHUS  round  the  Grecian  ships  was  the  fight  maintained.     But 
A  Patroclus, 

Quitting  their  camp,  had  reached  the  tent  of  royal  Achilles. 
Tears  from  his  eyes  fell  warm,  like  some  dark  fountain,  whose  waters 
Trickle  in  shadow  and  gloom  down  a  beetling  cliff  in  the  desert. 
Pitying,  godlike  Achilles  beheld  the  grief  of  his  comrade, 
And  in  compassionate  words  of  anxious  enquiry  addressed  him  : 
"Why  dost  thou  weep,  my  friend?  like  an  infant  girl  by  her  mother 
Running,  who  cries  to  be  taken  up,  and  clings  to  her  garments, 
Holding  them  fast  as  she  runs,  and  her  steps  detains ;  to  her  mother 
Still  looking  up  with  streaming  eyes,  and  begs  to  be  carried?        (10) 
Such,  and  so  piteous,  Patroclus  !  the  tears  that  pour  down  thy  features. 
Bear'st  thou  tidings  of  ill  to  myself  or  my  Myrmidon  warriors  ? 
Or  to  thy  private  ear  hath  a  mournful  message  from  Phthia 
Reached  ?     Thy  father  Mencetius  survives,  great  offspring  of  Actor : 
So  they  report:  and  Peleus,  ^Eacus'  son,  in  his  kingdom. 
Much  should  we  grieve  to  learn  the  decease  of  one  or  the  other. 
Or,  for  those  hateful  Greeks  dost  thou  mourn,  who  are  falling  by 

thousands 
There  at  their  hollow  ships ;  fit  meed  for  their  pride  and  injustice  ? 
Speak !  let  me  know  the  cause.     Be  there  no  concealment  between 

us." 
Deep   was   the   sigh,  Patroclus !     that    burst    from    thy   bosom   in 

answer:  (20)

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XVI. 


"Noblest  by  far  of  the  Greeks,  O  Achilles,  Peleiis'  offspring! 
Be  not  thus  wroth.     So  heavy  a  blow  hath  fall'n  on  the  Grecians  ! 
All  their  best  and  bravest  chiefs  lie  smitten  disabled, 
Wounded  with  spears  and  darts,  and  forced  to  retire  to  their  vessels. 
Brave  Diomedes,  Tydeus'  son,  hath  been  struck  by  an  arrow, 
Pierced  by  a  spear  Agamemnon  groans,  and  mighty  Odysseus, 
And  from  Eurypylus'  thigh  the  shaft  with  these  hands  I  extracled. 
These  with  their  healing  arts  may  physicians  cure,  or  their  torments 
Soothe  and  assuage.     Thy  wrath  admits  no  soothing,  Achilles  ! 
Oh  !  may  such  anger  ne'er  invade  my  heart  as  thou  harbour'st,      (30) 
Cruel,  though  brave  !   Who  henceforth  will  take  delight  to  behold  thee 
If  thou  refuse  thine  aid  to  Greece  in  the  hour  of  her  trouble  ? 
Pitiless  man !  'tis  false  to  say  that  Peleus  begot  thee. 
Thetis  was  never  thy  mother  !     The  stormy  ocean  produced  thee, 
Rude  inaccessible  crags  were  thy  parents — like  thee  in  nature. 
Yet  if  some  oracle  deep  in  thy  mind  have  sunk,  and  withhold  thee, 
Or  if  thy  mother  august  from  Zeus  have  brought  thee  a  warning, 
Send  me  forth  in  thy  stead  with  all  thy  Myrmidon  warriors, 
So '  shall  I  come  like  a  beam  of  light  to  the  hopeless  Achaians. 
Clad  in  thine  own  refulgent  arms  let  me  lead  them  to  battle :  (40) 
Thus,  by  thy  semblance  deceived,  will  the  Trojans  shrink  from  the 

combat, 
And  to  the  wearied  Greeks  some  breathing  time  be  accorded, 
Brief  though  it  be ;  and  a  respite  gained  from  war  and  its  horrors. 
Fresh  as  we  are  'twill  be  no  hard  task  to  drive  back  the  Trojans, 
Wearied,  and  worn  with  toil,  from  the  ships  and  tents  to  their  city." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  ended  his  earnest  prayer :  but  foresaw  not, 
Rash  as  he  was,  that  he  prayed  for  death  and  courted  destruction. 
Deeply  disturbed  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles  : 
"Noble  Patroclus,  what  words,  alas!  are  these  thou  hast  uttered ? 
Think  not  that  oracles  hold  me  back,  or  thoughts  of  the  future.  (50) 
Thetis,  my  mother  august,  from  Zeus  no  warning  hath  brought  me. 
'Tis  but  the  deep-corroding  pang  that  gnaws  at  my  heart-strings, 
When  I  remember  the  wretch  who,  secure  in  the  pride  of  his  power, 
Dared  to  amerce  and  rob  of  his  prize  his  equal  in  merit: 
This  is  my  grief.     It  weighs  on  my  soul,  and  embitters  my  spirit : 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  343 

This !    that   the    damsel   whom    Greece    bestowed   as   the   prize    of 

my  valour, 
Her  whom  I  won  by  my  own  good  spear  in  the  sack  of  her  city, 
He,  Agamemnon — sovereign  of  Greece  ! — descendant  of  Atreus  l-8- 
Forced  from  my  arms,  as  from  those  of  some  base  alien  hireling. 
These    are    things    of    the    past.      Be   it   so.      'Twas    ne'er  my 

intention,  (60) 

Anger  for  ever  to  cherish.  Now  close  to  my  ships  are  approaching 
Hostile  shouts  and  the  clang  of  war.  Now  behold  we  the  moment, 
Well  foreseen,  when  my  wrath  must  be  laid  aside  and  forgotten. 
Brace    then    around    thee   my   arms,    to   the   foe   well   known   and 

conspicuous : 
Lead  to  the  fight  our  Myrmidon  host  who  are  panting  for  battle. 
Great  is  the  need  I  for  lo  !  how  the  Trojans,  gath'ring  around  them, 
Wrap,  like  a  low'ring  cloud,  the  ships  :  how,  cooped  on  the  sea-beach, 
Hemmed  in  on  all  sides,  hardly  a  strip  of  land  to  the  Grecians 
Now  remains.     Embolden'd  all  Troy  comes  pouring  upon  them, 
Since  that  her  armies  have  ceased  to  behold  the  front  of  my  helmet  (70) 
Gleaming  at  hand.     Ere  now  had  they  filled  yon  trench  with  their 

corpses, 
Flying  in  wild  dismay,  had  that  tyrant  prince,  Agamemnon, 
Borne  himself  mildly.     Now  their  battle  thickens  around  him : 
Now  hath  the  idle  spear  in  the  hands  of  mighty  Tydeides 
Ceased  to  rage,  and  to  sweep  from  the  earth  the  foes  of  Achaia — 
Now  no  more  in  mine  ears  from  the  hateful  lips  of  Atreides, 
Rings  the  resounding  shout.    'Tis  the  voice  of  death-dealing  Hector 
Rises  o'er  all  the  clamour,  exhorting  his  troops.     And  the  Trojans 
Fill  with  their  war-cries  wild  the  plain,  and  scatter  his  Argives. 
Fall  on  them  then,  Patroclus  !  in  all  thy  might,  and  the  vessels    *(^°) 
Rescue  from  hostile  attack;  nor  suffer  the  flames  to  consume  them, 
Thus  destroying  for  ever  our  hopes  of  return  to  our  country. 
Hear  now  my  last  injunction,  my  parting  word,  and  respect  it : 
So  for  thy  friend  shalt  thou  win  from  all  the  hosts  of  Achaia 
Glory  and  honour  due  ;  and  the  beauteous  maid  shall  they  render 
Back  to  my  arms,  and  with  costly  gifts  deserve  ray  forgiveness. 
Drive  from  the  ships  the  Trojans,  and  then  return.     But  however 


344  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 


Glory  may  tempt  thee,  and  aid  from  the  thund'ring  consort  of  Here  j 
Press  not  too  hard,  apart  from  me,  on  the  host  of  the  Trojans. 
Hold   thy   conquering   hand   lest   thou    plunge    me    in    deeper   dis- 
honour. (90) 
[Slay  whom  thou  wilt  beside,  but  lay  not  thy  hands  upon  Hector ;] 
Nor  let  the  joy  of  success,  or  the  rage  of  conquest  and  slaughter, 
Hurry  thee  on  in  pursuit  to  fight  at  the  walls  of  their  city,       (92) 
Lest  some  one  of  th'  immortal  gods  who  dwell  in  Olympus, 
Come  to  their  aid.    Far-darting  Phcebus  loves  and  protects  them. 
Therefore  so  soon  as  the  ships  stand  clear  of  the  foe  and  in  safety, 
Hither  return.     In  the  open  held  let  them  fight  unmolested. 
Would  that — O  Father  Zeus,  and  Apollo,  and  Pallas  Athene ! — 
Would    that    not    one    out    of  both  their  hosts   might   escape  from 

destruction, 
Trojan  or  Greek ;  that  we  two  alone  might  survive,  to  accomplish 
Ilion's  ruin,  and  trample  in  dust  her  sacred  defences."  (IO°) 

Such  was  the  conference  held  in  Achilles'  tent  by  the  chieftains. 
Aias,  the  while,  with  darts  oppressed,  but  faintly  resisted. 
Crushed  by  the  adverse  will  of  Zeus,  o'er-borne  by  the  Trojans, 
Feebly  he  fought.     The  shining  helm  that  protected  his  temples 
Rang  with  sharp  and  repeated  blows.    Crest,  cheek-piece,  and  vizor, 
Battered  alike,  resounded.    The  pond'rous  shield  from  his  shoulder 
Wearily  hung.    Yet  all  their  force  availed  not  to  move  him, 
Pressing    around    with    their   darts   and    spears.       Meanwhile   from 

his  bosom, 
Lab'ring,  the  breath  came  thick,  and  from  ev'ry  limb  in  a  torrent 
Poured    down   the   sweat.     Not  a  moment  to  rest  or  breathe   was 
he  suffered,  (IIQ) 

Danger  on  danger,  woes  on  woes,  came  thick'ning  around  him. 

Tell  me,  ye  Muses  !  ye  who  the  halls  of  Olympus  inhabit, 
How  the  consuming  flames  first  reached  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
Hector,  as  Aias  wielded  his  ashen  spear,  on  the  weapon 
Dealt  with  his  mighty  sword  a  stroke,  which  sheer  at  the  socket 
Severed  the  wood,  and  the  blade  flew  off.     Telamonian  Aias 
Brandished  in  vain  the  headless  spear,  while  its  point  at  a  distance 
Fell,  with  a  brazen  clang  to  the  ground.    Then  shuddered  the  hero  ; 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  345 

For  as  the  act  of  heav'n  his  soul  accepted  the  omen. 
Thundering  Zeus,  he  believed,  cut  off  all  hope  of  resistance,         (I2°) 
Warning  him  thus,  that  Troy  at  length  must  prevail  in  the  contest. 
So  from  the  tempest  of  darts  he  retired.     Then  show'r'd  on  the  vessels 
Torches,  and  burning  brands,  and  the  flame  burst  forth  unextinguished. 
High  o'er  the  tow'ring  stern  soon  rose  the  blaze.     Then  Achilles 
Smote  with  his  hand  on  his  thigh,  and  thus  accosted  Patroclus  : 
"  Up  !  and  be  doing,  Patroclus.    My  steeds  shall  bear  thee  to  conquest. 
Now  from  the  ships  I  behold  the  flames  in  their  fury  ascending. 
Let  them  not  burn  our  fleet,  and  cut  off  the  return  of  our  armies, 
On  with  my  arms  at  once !     Myself  will  assemble  our  warriors." 

Thus  he  spake :  and  Patroclus  in  arms  refulgent  arrayed  him;     (130) 
First  to  his  manly  legs  the  rich-wrought  greaves  he  adjusted, 
Beauteous  with  silver  hasps,  and  clasped  round  the  ankles  with  silver : 
Next  o'er  his  breast  the  corslet  he  braced  of  mighty  Achilles, 
Bright  as  a  star,  and  gleaming  with  rainbow  hues  intermingling ; 
Slung  o'er  his  shoulder  his  sword  of  bronze,  bright  hilted  with  silver  \ 
Slung  too,  ready  for  use,  his  broad  and  ponderous  buckler, 
Placed  on  his  stately  head  his  helmet  of  proof,  with  a  horsetail 
Crested,  and  dreadfully  nodded  the  waving  plume  to  his  movements, 
While  with  familiar  hand  he  grasped  two  quivering  javlins. 
Only  the  mighty  spear,  which  ^Eacus'  peerless  descendant        (M0) 
Wielded,  heavy  and  strong,  he  bore  not.     Saving  Achilles, 
None  among  all  the  Greeks  might  avail  that  weapon  to  brandish  • 
Formed  from  an  ash,  upon  Pelion's  summit  hewn,  and  by  Chiron 
Giv'n  to  his  father,  to  end  the  days  of  many  a  hero. 
Next  by  Automedon's  hand  were  the  coursers  yoked,  by  Patroclus 
After  his  death-dealing  lord  most  held  its.  friendship  and  honour, 
Faithful  beyond  all  other,  and  trustiest  supporter  in  battle. 
He,  at  his  friend's  command,  the  noble  steeds  to  his  chariot, 
Xanthus  and  Balius,  yoked,  outstripping  the  winds  in  their  fleetness ; 
Whom,  by  the  blast  of  Zephyr  engender' d,  the  harpy  Podarge      (150) 
Bore,  where  the  mead  she  cropped,  on  the  utmost  verge  of  the  ocean. 
Stainless  of  race,  though  a  mortal  steed,  yet  matched  with  immortals. 
Loosely  attached  by  their  side  ran  Pedasus,  won  by  Achilles, 
When  triumphant  he  gathered  the  spoils  of  Eetion's  city. 


346  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 

Meanwhile  Achilles  in  all  their  tents  his  Myrmidon  warriors 
Sought,  and  in  arms  complete  arrayed.     Like  wolves  they  assembled, 
Raw-devouring,  immense  in  strength  and  unspeakable  fierceness ; 
Which,  on  some  antlered  stag  having  made  their  meal,  in  the  mountains 
Seiz'd  and  devour' d,  and  all  their  jaws  still  dripping  with  carnage, 
Rush  in  a  pack  to  some  gloomy  pool,  and  crowding  about  it,       (160) 
Lap  the  black  flood,  with  their  long  thin  tongues;   wide  scattering 

around  them 
Gory  foam  from  their  murd'rous  jaws:  while  their  maws  are  distended, 
Hungry,  though  full;  fire  burns  in  their  eyes  and  rage  in  their  bosoms  : 
Thus  round  the  brave  companion  of  ^Eacus'  mighty  descendant 
Crowded  in  eager  haste  the  Myrmidon  host  and  their  leaders. 
Full  in  the  midst  of  the  gathering  bands  stood  warlike  Achilles, 
Marshalling  all,  both  chariots  and  bucklered  men  in  their  order. 

Fifty  swift  ships  from  the  Phthian  shore  were  launched  by  Achilles, 
Fav'rite  of  Zeus,  when  for  Troia's  land  he  embarked.     In  each  vessel 
Rowed  at  the  bench  full  fifty  companions  inarms  and  in  labour.    (170) 
Five  were  the  leaders  appointed,  whom  all  should  obey :  but  Achilles, 
Held  the  supreme  command,  and  directed  all,  as  their  sov'reign. 
One  of  the  troops,  by  Menesthius,  mail-clad  chief,  was  commanded, 
Sprung  from  the  river-god,  Spercheius,  heaven-descended. 
Whom  to  Spercheius  fair  Polydora,  Peleiis'  daughter 
Bore,  to  a  mortal  race  immortal  vigour  imparting. 
Borus  howbeit,  Perieres'  son,  was  reputed  his  father, 
Who  by  a  splendid  dow'r  from  Peleus  obtained,  and  espoused  her. 

Next  of  the  Myrmidon  bands  was  that  by  Eudorus  commanded, 
Son  of  a  virgin  (so  me?i  believed).     Him  fair  Polymela,  (I8o) 

Daughter  of  Phylas,  bore  whom   the  mighty  slayer  of  Argus 
Dancing  beheld  and  loved,  as  she  gracefully  moved,  and  in  chorus 
Chanted  harmonious  hymns  to  the  huntress  Queen  in  her  temple. 
So  to  her  chamber  fair  beneath  the  roof  he  ascended, 
Where  to  the  secret  vows  of  the  gentle  god  she  consented. 
Thence  sprang  Eudorus,  swift  in  the  race  and  fierce  in  the  combat. 
But  when  th'  Ilythiae,  torturing  pow'rs  presiding  o'er  child-birth, 
Gave  him  at  length  to  the  day,  and  he  saw  the  light  of  the  sunbeam, 
Mighty  Echecleus,  Actor's  offspring,  sought  her  in  marriage, 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  347 

Wooed    her    with    countless    gifts,    and   led   her   as    bride    to    his 
palace,  i1^) 

Phylas  her  father  received  the  child,  and  cherished  and  nursed  him, 
Dotingly  fond,  and  reared  him  with  all  the  cares  of  a  parent. 
Chief  of  the  third  brave  band  was  the  warlike  hero  Pisander, 
Msemalus'  son  ;  renowned  through  the  Myrmidon  host  as  a  spearman. 
All  he  excelled,  save  one,  Peleides'  friend  and  companion. 
Phcenix,  experienced  knight,  commanded  the  fourth.     The  remainder 
Peerless  Alcimedon,  son  of  Laerceus,  led  to  the  battle. 

Now  had  Achilles  in  just  array  each  band  with  its  leaders 
Marshalled;  and  thus  he  spake,  giving  forth  his  parting  injunctions  : 
••  Myrmidons !       now    forget    not    the    threats    ye    hurled    at    the 
Trojans  (200) 

Here  at  your  ships  while  idle  ye  lay  : — how  ye  murmured  against  me 
Those  long  days  when  I  cherished  my  wrath : — how  ye  blamed  my 

retirement. 
These  were  your  words.     'Perverse  Peleides  !   surely  thy  mother 
Nursed  thee  in  wrath,  who  with  cruel  constraint  detain st  us  from  battle. 
Better  it  were  to  dismiss  us  at  once  in  our  ships  o'er  the  waters 
Than  to  consume  thyself  and  us  with  thy  moody  resentment.' 
Such  were  your  constant  complaints.     But  now  lies  op'ning  before  you 
All  that  glorious  work  of  war  your  spirits  rejoice  in. 
On  then  !  and  bravely  fight,  to  your  hearts'  content,  with  the  Trojans." 
Thus  he  spake,  in  each  bosom  resolve  and  courage  inspiring.    (210) 
Closer  they  pressed  in  their  ranks  when  they  heard  the  words  of  their 

so  v"  reign. 
Firm  as  the  close  compacted  stones  which  the  builder  arranges, 
Forming  the  wall  of  some  lofty  mansion,  proof  against  tempests, 
Clung  together  the  bossy  shields  and  casques  of  the  warriors, 
Buckler  to  buckler,  man  to  man,  and  helmet  to  helmet, 
Thick  intermingling  the  horsetail  crests  that  floated  above  them. 
Helm  touching  helm,  as  wedged  in  a  mass  they  supported  each  other  : 
While  in  the  front  of  all  Automedon  stood  and  Patroclus, 
Armed  at  all points ;  one  soul,  one  thought,  both  heroes  inspiring 
Bravely  to  lead  into  battle  the  Myrmidon  host.     But  Achilles      (220) 
Now  to  his  tent  retired  :  there  opened  the  lid  of  a  coffer 


348  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 

Fair,  with  carving  adorned,  which  Thetis  the  silvery-footed 
Stowed  in  his  ship  for  use,  well  stored  with  tunics  and  mantles 
Proof  against  wind  and  rain,   and   with  thick  fleeced  cov'rings   of 

tap'stry. 
There  lay  a  rich  wrought  bowl,  from  which  no  lips  of  a  mortal 
Ever  had  drained  the  dark  red  wine,  nor  holy  libation 
Ever  been  poured,  save  Father  Zeus,  to  one  of  th'  immortals. 
This  from  the   chest   he  took,    and   with  sulphurous  fumes   having 

cleansed  it, 
Rinsed  it  with  copious  streams  of  water,  fresh  from  the  fountain 
Next   his   own   hands   he   laved,    and   with   sparkling   wine   having 
filled  it,  (23°) 

Stood  in  the  midst  of  the  sacred  precinct ;  his  eyes  to  the  heavens 
Raising,  and  prayed :   nor   ascended   his   prayer   unmarked   by  the 

Tkund'rer. 
"  Zeus  supreme  !     Dodonian  !  Pelasgian  !  in  lofty  remoteness 
Dwelling  !   in  chill  Dodona's  mystic  groves,  where  the  Selli 
Sleeping  on  earth,  with  unwash'd  feet,  thy  visions  interpret! 
Now  thou,  indeed,  hast  bent  thine  ear  to  the  prayer  of  thy  suppliant, 
Granting  me  honour  and  fame,  and  inflicting  woes  on  the  Argives. 
Yet  once  more  be  propitious,  and  grant  this  further  petition  : — 
While  I  remain,  myself,  confined  to  my  ships ;  and  inactive, 
Send  to  the  fight  my  friend  with  many  a  Myrmidon  warrior,         (240) 
Watch  der  him,  all-beholding  Zeus  !     Bid  glory  attend  him. 
Fill  with  undaunted  courage  and  strength  his  heart,  and  let  Hector 
Learn  what  Achilles'  friend  alone  can  do  : — that  his  valour 
Needs  not  the  aid  of  my  own  unconquered  might,  through  the  combat 
Raging  in  all  the  pomp  of  war,  to  confound  and  defeat  him. 
Grant  that,  the  foe  from  the  Grecian  ships  having  driv'n,   and  the 

tumult 
Cleared  from  their  camp,  he  may  back  return  unscathed,  with  his  armour 
Whole  and  complete,  and  his  comrades  brave  collected  around  him." 
Such  was  his  prayer :  and  Zeus,  disposer  of  all  in  his  wisdom, 
Heard,  yet  granted  but  half  the  request;  refusing  the  other.  .      (250) 
This  he  accorded — to  rescue  the  ships  from  war  and  destruction. 
Safe  return  for  his  friend  with  his  comrades  brave  he  refused  him.

Thus  having  prayed  his  prayer,  and  poured  unto  Zeus  his  libation, 
Back  to  his  tent  he  returned  and  replaced  the  bowl  in  its  coffer. 
Thence  advancing,  in  front  of  the  tent  he  stood,  and  intently 
Gazed,  for  he  longed  once  more  to  behold  his  Myrmidons  fighting. 
These  in  complete  array  and  refulgent  arms,  by  Patroclus 
Marshalled,  exulting  in  hope,  rushed  on,  and  closed  with  the  Trojans, 
Aclive  and  swift  as  wasps  that  in  swarms  pour  forth  in  a  pathway 
Out  of  their  way-side  nests ;  whom  wanton  boys  in  their  folly       (260) 
Irritate  more  and  more ;   till  they  fill  the  air,   and  in  a?iger 
Fly  upon  all  alike  with  enve?iomed  sting;  nor  the  traveller 
Spare,  who  unmeaning  harm  their  rage  excites  as  he  passes  : 
Fierce  on  the  wing,  with  courageous  hearts,  and  reckless  of  danger, 
All  rush  forth  to  the  fight  in  defence  of  their  homes  and  their  offspring  : 
Xot  with  less  ardent  souls  poured  forth  in  a  swarm  from  their  vessels 
All  the  brave  Myrmidon  host.     Loud  swelled  the  roar;  and  Patroclus, 
Raising  his  powerful  voice  above  all  the  tumult,  addressed  them  : 
"Myrmidons!  brave  companions  in  arms  of  glorious  Achilles, 
Shew     yourselves     men;    remember    your     ancient     prowess    and 
valour!  -  (27°) 

So  shall  ye  worthily  honour  your  mighty  master  Peieides, 
First  of  the  Greeks,  whom  ye  serve  with  the  ?ioble  devotion  of  heroes  ; 
So  shall  ye  prove  to  their  king  Agamemnon  his  madness  and  folly, 
When  he  so  foully  disgraced  the  best  and  bravest  among  them.*' 

Thus  as  he  spake,  fresh  courage  and  strength  arose  in  their  bosoms ; 
All  at  once,  in  a  mass,  on  the  Trojans  they  fell ;  and  the  vessels 
Dreadfully  echoed  the  warcries  fierce  of  the  shouting  Achaians. 
But  when  the  Trojans  beheld  the  valiant  son  of  Menoetius 
Shining  in  glittering  arms,  and  Autornedon  guiding  his   chariot, 
Sank   their   hearts  in  dismay.     Their  wavering  ranks  in  their  onset 
Faltered:  for  all  believed  that  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles,         (281) 
Casting  aside  his  wrath,  with  the  Greeks  had  renewed  his  alliance. 
Each  looked  anxious  around  for  means  to  escape  from  destruction. 

First  of  the  Greeks,  Patroclus  hurled  his  glittering  jav'lin 
Right  in  their  midst,  where  closest  the  foe,  where  thickest  the  tumult 
E.aged,  round  the  lofty  ship  of  the  hapless  Protesilaiis. 
Full  on  Pvrsechmes  it  fell,  who  the  crested  Paeonian  warriors 


350  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 

Led  from  Amydon's  plain,  on  the  banks  of  wide-flowing  Axius. 
Through  the  right  shoulder  pierced,  supine  he  fell ;  in  his  death-pang 
Utt'ring  a  piercing  cry  as  he  rolled  in  the  dust.    His  companions   (290) 
Fled,  to  a  man;  for  Patroclus  had  filled  each  bosom  with  terror, 
Thus  having  slain  their  leader,  the  bravest  warrior  among  them. 

Now  from  the  fleet  had  he  driv'n  them  all,  and  the  flames  were 
extinguished. 
Leaving  the  bark  half  burned,  in  headlong  flight  and  confusion 
Fled  forth  the  Trojans  with  hideous  cries.     Out  poured  from  their 

vessels 
All  the  Greeks,  and  an  uproar  wild  resounded  on  all  sides. 
As  when  from  some  vast  mountain's  lofty  summit  the  Thund'rer 
Drifts  off  the  dense  and  low'ring  clouds,  that  wrapped  it  in  darkness, 
Shine  forth  the  rocks  in  light :  each  buttressed  peak,  and  each  valley 
Glows,  as  the  rending  veil  discloses  the  measureless  aether :     (300) 
So  for  a  while  the  Greeks,  their  fleet  now  rescued  from  burning, 
Freely  respired.     Yet  ceased  not  thus  the  fray :  for  the  Trojans, 
Fled  not  in  utter  rout,  from  the  dark  array  of  the  vessels, 
Leaving  the  Greeks  an  open  field.     Reluctantly  yielding, 
Pressed,  they  resisted  still,  and  only  retired  on  compulsion. 

Thus  o'er  a  wider  space  was  the  combat  spread.     Of  the  leaders 
Man  slew  man.     Then  first  the  redoubted  son  of  Mencetius, 
Smote  Areilochus,  turning  him  round,  on  the  thigh,  with  his  jav'lin 
Brazen  and  sharp.     Straight  through  went  the  spear,  and  the  bone  in 

its  passage 
Shattered,  and  prone  on  his  face  to  the  ground  he  sank.  Menelaus  (31c) 
Thoas  assailed.     Where  his  breast  was  exposed  o'er  the  rim  of  his 

buckler 
Entered  the  spear.     To  the  ground  he  fell,  and  his  spirit  departed. 
Phyleus'  son,  Amphiclus  observing  advancing  to  meet  him, 
Darted  his  lance  with  dext'rous  aim,  and  just  where  the  muscles 
Swell  to  their  fullest  curve  in  the  midst  of  the  leg,  he  transfixed  him, 
Sev'ring  each  tendon  and  nerve.     He  fell,  and  darkness  involved  him. 

Next  came  Nestor's  sons.     Antilochus  first,  with  his  jav'lin 
Wounded  Atymnius.    Deep  in  his  flank  infixed  was  the  weapon, 
Down  at  his  feet  he  sank.     Then  Maris  rushed  on  the  victor, 


Book  XVI.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


35i 


Eager  to  guard  the  dead,  and  avenge  the  fall  of  his  brother.  (320) 

Close  he  approached,  but  before  he  could  hurl  his  spear,  Thrasymedes 
Marked  him  for  death,  with  a  sharp,  clear  aim :  nor  in  vain  flew  his 

jav'lin, 
Full  on  his  shoulder  it  lighted,  and  tearing  the  bone  from  its  socket, 
Severed  the  limb,  clean  cutting  athwart  the  muscles  and  sinews ; 
Down  with  a  crash  he  fell,  and  darkness  gathered  around  him. 
Thus  by  the  hands  of  brothers,  dispatched  to  the  mansion  of  Hades, 
Perished  a  noble  pair,  Sarpedon's  heroic  companions, 
Sons  of  Amisodarus,  the  same  who  bred  the  Chimgera, 
Pest  untameable,  hateful  to  Gods,  and  deadly  to  mortals. 

While  through  the  crowd  Cleobulus  pushed,  Oilean  Aias      (330) 
Seized  him  alive,  but  spared  him  not :  for  a  stroke  of  his  falchion 
Severed  at  once  his  head  from  the  bleeding  neck,  and  the  weapon,  . 
Warmed  in  his  blood,  from   hilt   to   point,  dripped  gore  :   and  his 

eyelids, 
Purple  death  weighed  down,  and  fate's  irresistible  pressure. 
Peneleus  next,  and  Lycon  closed.     They  had  darted  their  lances, 
Each  at  the  other  in  vain,  for  each  flew  wide  of  its  object : 
So  on  each  other  with  swords  they  rushed.     Then  Lycon  delivered 
First  on  his  foeman's  horse-tail  crest  a  blow;   but  the  weapon, 
Striking  the  cone,  broke  short.     More  true,  the  sword  of  the  Grecian, 
Entered  his  neck  beneath  the  ear.     Deep  gashing,  it  severed  (340) 
All  but  a  shred,  whence  hung  the  head ;  and  he  sank  overpowered. 
Acamas,  hotly  by  Merion  pursued  as  he  mounted  his  chariot, 
Through  the  right  shoulder  received  the  piercing  point  of  his  jav'lin : 
Down  from  the  car  he  rolled,  and  darkness  closed  o'er  his  eyelids. 
Erymas  fell  to  Idomeneus'  spear.     The  pitiless  weapon 
Entered  his  mouth,  and  forced  its  way  through  the  back  of  his  helmet, 
Passing  beneath  the  brain,  and  crushed  the  white  bones  in  its  passage, 
Dashing  his  teeth  aside.     Blood  filled  his  eyes.     From  his  nostrils, 
And  from  his  gaping  jaws,  the  sanguine  stream  in  a  torrent 
Poured  with  a  gurgling  sound,  while  death's  black  shadow  enwrapped 
him.  (350) 

Thus  did  each  Grecian  chief  from  the  Trojans  choose  forth  a  victim : 
Falling  upon  them,  as  rav'nous  wolves  on  lambs,  or  on  kidlings, 


352  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 


Suffered   by  negligent   shepherds   to    stray  with  the   flock  o'er   the 

mountains, 
Which  when  they  see,  they  snatch  them  off,  and  tear  them  to  pieces ; 
Taking  their  choice  from  the  helpless  flock,  unused  to  resistance : 
Thus  fell  the  Greeks  on  the  Troian  host,  who  now  but  of  safety 
Thought,  and  -of  flight,  forgetting  their  former  prowess  and  valour. 

Aias,  the  giant  chief,  still  sought  with  his  spear  to  encounter 
Hector,  the  brazen-helmed.     But  he,  too  wary  and  skilful, 
Cov'ring  his  shoulders  broad  with  the  tough  bull-hide  of  his  buck- 
ler, (36o) 
Heard,  secure,  the  hiss  of  the  darts,  and  the  shock  of  the  jav'lins. 
All  too  well  he  perceived  that  fate  that  day  was  against  him, 
Yet  he  remained,  resolved  to  save  his  friends  and  companions. 

As  from  Olympus'  heights  a  cloud  spreads  forth  o'er  the  heavens, 
Blotting  the  clear  bright  sky,  when  Zeus  is  preparing  a  tempest ; 
Thus  from  the  ships  spread  forth  wild  flight,  confusion,  and  clamour. 
Order  no  more  prevailed  as  they  fled.     The  horses  of  Hector 
Bore  him  away,  with  his  arms,  at  speed.     There  left  he  the  Trojans, 
Struggling  to  pass  the  trench,  which  hemmed  their  way  and  confined 

them. 
Fiery  steeds,  with  frantic  plunge,  broke  loose  front  their  harness,     (370) 
Leaving  the  cars  of  their  lords,  with  broken  poles,  in  its  hollows. 
After  them  flew  Patroclus,  and  loudly  cheered  on  the  Grecians, 
Thirsting  for  Trojan  blood  :  while  those  with  confusion  and  clamour, 
Flying  in  all  directions,  blocked  the  paths.     In  a  whirlwind 
Mounted  the  dust  to  the  clouds,  as  the  trampling  hoofs  of  the  horses 
Hurried  away  from  the  tents  and  ships  to  the  walls  of  the  city. 

Still,  where  the  rout  was  thickest,  and  loudest  the  clamour,  Patroclus 
Urged  on  his  steeds  with  impatient  cries,  while  under  his  axles, 
Headlong  dashed  from  their  shattered  cars,  rolled  many  a  hero. 
Nor  did  the  trench  oppose.    With  a  bound  the  coursers  immortal,  (380) 
Glorious  gifts  of  the  gods  above  to  the  sire  of  Achilles, 
Cleared  it,  from  side  to  side.    Then  turned  his  thoughts  upon  Hector, 
Longing   to  slay  him.     In   vain :   for  his  steeds  out  of  reach  had 

conveyed  him. 
As  when  athwart  the  black'ning  earth  the  gloom  of  the  tempest 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  353 

Drearily  sweeps,  when  autumnal  rains  pour  down  at  their  fiercest 
(Sent  by  Almighty  Zeus  as  a  sign  of  his  heavy  displeasure, 
When  by  perverse  decrees,  by  force  obtain'd,  in  th'  assembly, 
Bad  men  trample  on  justice,  and  brave  the  vengeance  of  heaven), 
Full  to  o'erflowing  is  ev'ry  stream.     Deep  cleaving,  the  torrents 
Furrow  the  mountain  slopes  with  yawning  ravines.    To  the  ocean  (390) 
Wild  they  rush  with  impetuous  roar,  and  fling  themselves  headlong 
Down  from  the  crags  ;  and  the  labours  of  man  disappear  in  a  moment. 
Such  was  the  roar  and  rush  of  the  panting  steeds  and  the  chariots. 

Now  of  the  fugitive  host  intercepting  the  nearest,  Patroclus 
Drove  them  towards  the  ships ;  nor  allowed  them  to  make  for  the  city, 
Much  as  they  longed  to  reach  it :  and  there,  in  the  space  that  extended 
'Twixt  the  ships  and  the  lofty  walls  and  the  course  of  the  river, 
Hemmed  them,  and  numbers  slew,  exacting  a  terrible  vengeance. 
Pronoiis  first  on  the  breast  he  smote  with  his  glittering  jav'lin, 
Where  by  his  shield  uncovered  left,  and  cut  short  his  existence.    (400) 
Down  with  a  crash  he  fell.     Then  Thestor,  offspring  of  Enops, 
Next  he  attacked ;  who  crouching,  all  panic-stricken  and  helpless, 
Sate  in  his  polished  car.    From  his  hands,  unable  to  hold  them, 
Dropped  the  reins.     Patroclus  approached,  and  rushing  upon  him 
Drove  through  his  cheek  the  spear,  which  shattered  the  teeth  in 

its  passage. 
Then  o'er  the  rail  of  his  car  he  dragged  him  out :  as  a  fisher, 
Sitting  on  some  projecting  crag  overlooking  the  ocean, 
Draws  a  huge  fish  with  his  line  and  brazen  hook  from  the  water, 
Hideously  gaping  thus  was  Thestor  dragged  from  his  chariot.  (409) 
Hurled  to  the  ground,  on  his  face  he  fell,  and  his  spirit  forsook  him. 
Next  Eryalus  he  smote  with  a  stone,  who  came  rushing  against  him, 
Full  on  his  head  it  fell,  which  in  twain  it  split;  nor  his  helmet 
Aught   could   avail,  though   strong,  to   protect   him.     Prostrate   he 

tumbled, 
Rolled  in  the  dust,  and  the  hand  of  death  weighed  heavy  upon  him. 
Then  Erymantas  he  slew,  Amphoterus,  Echius,  Epaltes, 
Brave  Tlepolemus,  son  of  Damastor,  Ipheus,  and  Pyres, 
Argeas'  son  Polymelus,  Evippus : — one  on  the  other, 
Heaped  in  a  dreadful  pile,  encumbered  the  ground  with  their  corses.

154  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 


Now,  when  Sarpedon  beheld  his  companions  falling  around  him, 
Swept  from  the  field  by  the  ruthless  hand  of  the  son  of  Menoetius,  (420) 
Thus  in  upbraiding  words  he  accosted  the  Lycian  warriors : 
"  Shame  on  ye,  Lycians  !  where  are  ye  flying  ?  Put  forth  your  vigour  ! 
I  myself  will  confront  this  conquering  hero  and  test  him, 
If  he  be  mortal  ma?i  who  rages  thus  on  the  Trojans, 
Heaping  such  countless  woes,  and  making  such  havoc  among  us." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  leaped  to  the  ground  full  armed  from  his  chariot. 
Down  sprang  Patroclus  too,  and  at  once  both  heroes  encountered, 
Closing,  like  angry  vultures  on  some  high  rock,  who  contending, 
Buffet,  and  scream,  and  tear  with  their  crooked  beaks  and  their  talons. 
Thus  with  resounding  shouts  those  chieftains  rushed  on  each  other. 

Grieving,  beheld  their  meeting  the  son  of  mysterious  Kronos.  (431) 
Turning   to   Hera,    his   sister   and   spouse,    in   these  words   he  ad- 
dressed her : 
"Woe  to  my  soul!     Sarpedon,  my  son,  the  dearest  of  mortals, 
Now  by  the  fates'  decree  must  succumb  to  the  son  of  Menoetius. 
Sorely  with  doubts  is  my  heart  perplexed,  my  councils  divided  ! 
Can  I  not  snatch  him  away  from  this  wretched  struggle,  and  place  him 
Living  and  safe  once  more  in  his  wealthy  and  prosperous  Lycia ! 
Or  must  I  now  resign  him  to  fall  by  the  hand  of  Patroclus?" 

Turning  upon  him  her  radiant  eyes  thus  Hera  responded, 
"Offspring    of    Kronos    dread !    what   words    are    these   thou   hast 
spoken  ?  (44c) 

Wouldst  thou  then  snatch  from  gloomy  death,  the  portion  of  all  men , 
One,  though  a  hero,  mortal,  and  long  since  marked  for  destruction  ? 
Do  as  thou  wilt — but  all  the  Gods  will  blame  thy  decision. 
This,  moreover,  I  tell  thee,  and  well  shalt  thou  do  to  observe  it : 
Think !    shouldst    thou    rescue    Sarpedon    and   send   him   back   to 

his  kingdom, 
Will  not  some  other  God,  by  an  equal  claim,  from  the  combat 
Rescue  his  dear-lov'd  son  whom  he  sees  in  danger  to  perish? 
Gods  not  a  few  have  sons  round  the  lofty  city  of  Priam 
Fighting.     That  claim  refuse^  and  all  will  resent  thy  injustice. 
Is  he  so  dear  to  thy  soul?     Does  thine  heart  thus  yearn  to  thine 
offspring?  (450) 


Book  XV I.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  355 

Still  be  the  fates  fulfilled.     Let  him  fall  by  the  hand  of  Patroclus, 
Meeting  a  glorious  death  in  the  fierce  encounter  impending. 
But,  when  the  struggle  is  o'er,  when  his  soul  and  life  have  departed, 
Lay  thy  commands  on  gentle  Sleep  and  Death  to  convey  him 
Softly  back  to  his  own  wide  realm  and  his  Lycian  people. 
There  let  his  brethren  and  friends  fit  rites  perform,  and  the  honours 
Due  to  the  dead  bestow :  the  memorial  mound  and  the  column." 
Thus  she  spake  :  and  the  sire  of  Gods  and  mortals  assented, 
Show'ring  albeit  on  the  field  great  drops  of  blood  from  the  heavens, 
Mourning  his  son,  now  ready  to  fall  by  the  hand  of  Patroclus,      (460) 
Far  from  his  native  land,  in  the  fruitful  region  of  Troia. 

Now  were  the  heroes  met.    But  a  trifling  space  was  between  them, 
When  Patroclus  his  spear  dismissed,  and  the  brave  Thrasymelus 
Smote ;  of  Sarpedon  his  sov'reign  the  trusty  friend  and  attendant. 
Pierced   through   the   groin,   to  the   ground   he  fell,   and   his  spirit 

forsook  him. 
Then  flew  Sarpedon's  lance,  but  it  missed  the  mark  it  was  aimed  at, 
And  upon  Pedasus  lighted,  the  mortal  steed  of  Achilles. 
Which  through  the  shoulder  it  pierced.     With  a  yell  he  breathed  forth 

his  spirit, 
While  in  the  dust  he  rolled  and  moaning  lay.     But  his  fellows 
Started     asunder,    crashed     their    yoke,   and    the   reins    were    en- 
tangled, (470) 
Twining  about  the  prostrate  form  of  their  struggling  companion. 
This  when  Automedon  saw,  with  prompt  and  ready  decision 
Drawing  his  long  sharp  sword  from  his  stalwart  thigh,  he  dissevered 
All  that  bound  them  together,  and  soon  cast  loose  the  encumbrance. 
Then  to  the  pole  they  closed,  and  again  drew  straight  in  the  traces. 
Once  more  the  chiefs  prepared  to  renew  their  deadly  encounter. 
Once  more  Sarpedon  in  vain  dismissed  his  glittering  jav'lin. 
Erring,  above  Patroclus'  shoulder  it  flew;  and  unwounded 
Still  he  remained.     Not  so  the  spear  of  the  son  of  Mencetius, 
Not  thus  vainly  and  erring  it  flew  from  the  hand  of  its  master.      (480) 
Under  his  firm-knit  heart  it  passed,  through  the  fold  of  the  midriff. 
Prostrate  he  fell,  as  falls  a  gigantic  oak,  or  a  poplar, 
Or  as  some  lofty  pine  on  the  mountain-side,  which  the  shipwrights

356  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 

Hew  for  a  timber,  or  mast,  of  some  mighty  ship  with  their  axes. 
Thus  lay  the  Prince,  outstretched  beside  his  steeds  and  his  chariot, 
Grinding  his  teeth,  and  the  bloody  dust  convulsively  grasping. 
As  when  a  lion  hath  seized  some  lordly  bull  in  the  pasture, 
Tawny  and  huge,  from  the  trampling  herds  which  fly  from  his  presence, 
Bellowing  he  lies  beneath  the  devouring  jaws  of  the  monster  : 
Thus,  indignant  at  falling  beneath  the  hand  of  Patroclus,  (490) 

Lycia's  chief  in  groans  bespake  his  friend  and  companion  : 
"Glaucus  !   friend  of  my  heart !   most  brave  of  the  brave !  it  behoves 

thee 
Now  to   surpass  thyself,  and  shew  thyself  mighty  in  battle: 
Summon  up  all  thy  strength,  and  nerve  thy  heart  for  the  trial. 
Call  on  my  Lycian  warriors,  one  and  all,  to  assemble 
Round  the  corse  of  their  prince,  and  defend  the  remains  of  Sarpedon. 
Fight  thyself  for  thy  friend,  and  ply  thy  spear  to  protect  him  : 
For,  if  thou  fail  in  this — if  thou  suffer  the  Greeks  to  despoil  me, 
Leaving  me  here  among  their  ships, — henceforth  and  for  ever     (499) 
Shame  on  thy  front  will  sit,  and  bitter  reproach  will  pursue  thee. 
Hold  out  bravely,  and  fight  like  men,  both  thou  and  thy  comrades." 
Thus  while  he  spake,  the  shadow  of  death  drew  round,  and  his  eye- 
sight 
Failed,  and  his  breathing  ceased.     Then  Patroclus  his  heel  on  his 

bosom 
Planted,  and  drew  forth  the  spear,  its  point  entwined  with  his  heart- 
strings; 
Issued  the  life  with  the  gushing  blood,  and  followed  the  weapon ; 
While  by  the  Myrmidon  warriors  seized,  his  fiery  coursers 
Breaking  away  from  the  chariot  in  wild  affright  were  arrested. 
Dire  was  the  anguish  of  heart  which  on  Glaucus  fell  when  he  heard 
him, 
Knowing  himself  disabled,  and  all  unfit  for  the  struggle. 
Grasping  his  wounded  arm  he  pressed  it  hard,  for  he  suffered       (510) 
Grievous  pangs  from  the  hurt  which  Teucer's  shaft  had  inflicted 
When  in  defence  of  the  lofty  wall  he  resisted  his  onset. 
Then  in  his  anguish  he  prayed  to  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo  : 
"Hear  me,  O  King  !  whether  Lycia's . fertile  realm  with  thy  presence 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  357 

Gladdening,  or  Troia's  plains :  alike  thou  hear'st  the  afflicted 
Wheresoever  thou  art,  when  distress  like  mine  is  upon  them. 
Lo !  what  a  wound  I  bear !  what  piercing  torment  I  suffer 
Here  in  this  useless  arm  !  unstanched,  my  life-blood  is  streaming 
Still  from  its  open  wound,  while  helpless  it  hangs  from  my  shoulder. 
Nor  can  I  grasp  my  spear,  nor  meet  my  foe  in  the  battle,  (52°) 

Now,  too,  hath  perished  a  mighty  chief,  our  prince  and  our  leader, 
Brave  Sarpedon,  the  son  of  Zeus,  who  helped  not  his  offspring. 
Hear  me,  O  King  1  and  heal  this  unhappy  wound,  and  my  torments 
Bitter  assuage ;  and  restore  my  strength  that,  my  Lycian  comrades 
Once  more  gath'ring  in  arms,  I  may  cheer  them  on  to  the  combat : 
Fighting  myself  in  defence  of  the  mighty  dead,  as  becomes  me" 
Thus  in  his  anguish  he  prayed,   and  his  prayer  reached  Phoebus 

Apollo. 
Forthwith  the  raging  pain  he  allayed,  and  the  blood  from  his  elbow 
Black-distilling  he  stanched,  and  restored  him  to  soundness  and  vigour. 
Inly  conscious  of  pain  relieved  and  vigour  returning,  (530) 

Glaucus  rejoiced  in  his  soul,  for  his  prayer  he  knew  had  been  granted. 
First  to  the  Lycian  chiefs  he  went  his  rounds,  and  excited 
All  to.  collect,  and  fight  round  the  prostrate  form  0/"  Sarpedon. 
Then  to  the  Trojans  he  hasted  away  long-striding,  and  summoned 
Brave  Polydamas,  Panthoiis'  son,  and  godlike  Agenor, 
Then  unto  Hector,  lord  of  the  brazen  helm,  and  ^Eneas, 
Passed ;  and  taking  his  stand  at  Hector'  side,  he  addressed  him : 
"  Hector  !  thy  faithful  allies  may  justly  complain  of  thy  conduct, 
Who  for  thy  sake,  afar  from  their  friends,  afar  from  their  country, 
Pour   forth  their  lives    unstinting,  and  thou   dost  nought  to   assist 

them.  (54°) 

Now  is  Sarpedon  fall'n,  the  chief  of  our  Lycian  warriors, 
He  who  the  sceptre  of  Lycia  swayed  in  might  and  in  justice, 
Slain  by  Patroclus'  spear,  whom  bronze-mail'd  Ares  hath  aided. 
Come,   then,  my  friends !   stand  by  me.     Let  grief  and  vengeance 

inspire  you ; 
Let  them  not  spoil  his  arms,  nor  suffer  the  Myrmidon  warriors, 
Bearing  in  mind  the  Greeks  who  have  fall'n, — the  chiefs  without 

number 


358  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 

Who  by  his  lance  have  bled, — to  insult  the  remains  of  Sarpedon." 
Thus  he  spake ;  and  grief  unendurable  seized  on  the  Trojans, 
Bitter  and  deep :  for  a  tower  of  strength  had  he  been  to  their  city, 
Stranger  indeed,  yet  by  all  belov'd;  and  num'rous  his  forces,  (550) 

Many  the  heroes  he  led,  himself  the  bravest  among  them. 
Straight  at  the  Greeks  they  rushed  with  impetuous  fury,  and  Hector, 
Burning  with  rage  at  Sarpedon's  death,  at  their  head.    But  Patroclus, 
Valiant  and  stern  of  heart,  pushed  on  the  Grecians  to  meet  them, 
Thus  th'  Aiantes  addressing,  who  longed  like  himself  for  the  onset : 
"Noble  Aiantes!    Behold  the  joe  I    Be  it  yours  to  repel  him. 
Heroes  ye  always  were.     Be  now  more  heroic  than  ever! 
There  lies  the  chief,  Sarpedon,  who  first  surmounted  your  rampart. 
Now  is  the  time  to  dishonour  his  corse,  and  strip  from  his  shoulders 
All  those  glitt'ring  and  gorgeous  arms,  and  slay  without  mercy     (560) 
All  of  his  Trojan  friends  who  dare  approach  to  protect  him." 
Thus  he  spake.     Right  ready  were  both  to  lend  their  assistance. 

Now  upon  either  side  were  the  ranks  reinforced  for  the  struggle ; 
Trojans  with  Lycians  here,  there  Achaians  with  Myrmidons  joining. 
Closing,  with  dreadful  cries,  o'er  the  corse  they  fought ;  and  around  it 
Tumult  arose  ;  the  shout  of  the  troops,  and  clash  of  their  armour. 
Zeus  over  all  thick  darkness  stretched,  augmenting  the  horror, 
Deep'ning   the   fight   round   his   much-lov'd   son,  and   swelling   the 
carnage. 
Troy's  was  the  first  success.     The  first  who  fell  was  a  Grecian, 
One  not  last  nor  feeblest  of  all  the  Myrmidon  warriors,  (57°) 

Noble  Epeigeus,  valiant  son  of  the  mighty  Agacles, 
Who  in  Budaeum  ruled,  a  town  well-peopled  and  wealthy ; 
Thence  was  Epeigeus  chased,  having  caused  the  death  of  a  kinsman, 
And  unto  Peleus  came  and  Thetis  the  silvery-footed : 
Thence  dispatched  with  the  troops  to  swell  the  ranks  of  Achilles, 
Troia,  famed  for  its  steeds,  to  visit,  and  war  against  Ilium. 
Scarce   had   he   touched   the  dead,  when  a  stone  came  thund'ring 

from  Heel  or, 
Full  on  his  head  it  fell,  which  in  twain  it  split ;  nor  his  helmet 
Aught   could   avail,   though   strong,   to   protect   him.     Prostrate   he 
tumbled, 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  359 

Stretched   on  the   corpse,  and  the    hand    of  Death  weighed   heavy 

upon  him.  (580) 

Deep  was  the  grief  for  his  comrade  slain  which  seized  on  Patroclus, 
Straight    through    the    fray   he    dashed    like   the    swift-wing'd   hawk 

which  disperses 
Starlings  and  chaff  ring  daws  which  fly  before  him  in  terror. 
Such  was  thy  rush,  Patroclus  bold,  on  the  Trojans  and  Lycians, 
Such  was    the  wrath   in    thine   heart  when  thou  saw'st  the  fall  of 

thy  comrade. 
Full  on  the  neck  Sthenelaiis  he  smote,  Ithsemenes'  offspring, 
With  an  enormous  crag  which  tore  the  tendons  asunder. 
Fear  on  the  Trojans  seized  a?id  they  fled.    Ev'n  Hector  retreated, 
Far  as  the  flight  of  some  mighty  lance,  by  the  hand  of  a  spearman 
Hurled,  for  a  trial  of  strength,  in  peaceful  sport,  or  in  battle     (590) 
Aimed  at  some  distant  foe  in  the  deadly  struggle  of  heroes. 
So  far  the  Trojans  withdrew,  and  abandoned  the  field  to  the  Argives. 
Glaucus,  the  Lycian  chief,  was  the  first  to  turn,  and  advancing, 
Great  Bathyclaeus  encountered  and  slew,  brave  offspring  of  Chalcon, 
Who  in  the  region  of  Hellas  fair  in  wealth  and  abundance 
Dwelt  at  his  ease,  distinguished  among  the  Myrmidon  nobles, — 
Glaucus,  turning  him  suddenly  round,  when  just  overtaken, 
Lifted  his  shining  spear  and  pierced  to  the  heart  his  pursuer. 
Down  with  a  crash  he  fell.     Full  sore  was  the  grief  of  the  Argives, 
Seeing  a  chief  so  brave  struck  down,  while  the  Trojans  exulted.   (600) 
Rallying  around  in  crowds  they  stood  :  but  the  Grecians  advancing, 
Proud  of  their  ancient  prowess  and  strength,  came  rushing  upon  them. 

Merion  now  struck  down  a  crested  chief  of  the  Trojans, 
Mighty  and  fierce  in  fight,  Laogonus,  son  of  Onetor, 
Priest  of  Idaean  Zeus;  like  a  god  by  the  people  respected. 
Under  the  ear  and  beneath  the  jaw  the  blow  was  delivered. 
Life   fled   at   once  from  his  limbs,   and  darkness  gathered  around 

him. 
Then  at  Meriones,  lifting  aloft  his  shield  and  advancing, 
Mighty  yEneas  hurled  his  lance,  in  hopes  to  destroy  him; 
Not  unperceived  :  for  the  wary  chief  stooped  forward,  avoiding     (610) 
Death,  and  the  long  sharp  spear  passed  harmless  on,  and  behind  him

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XVI. 


Fixed  in  the  ground,  and  quivering  stood  from  the  point  to  the  handle, 
Guiltless  of  blood,  and  expended  its  mighty  force  in  its  tremors. 
[Vainly  the  weapon  had  fled  from  the  powerful  hand  of  its  master, 
Quivering  there  in  the  earth  it  stood,  deep-rooted  and  harmless.] 
Then  was  ^neas  wrath,  and  thus  he  vented  his  anger : 
"None  but  a  dancer  expert  could  have  thus  eluded  my  weapon. 
Merion  !  had  it  but   touched  thee  there  soon  were  an  end  of  thy 

gambols." 
Thus  to  his  taunt  rejoined  that  brave  and  redoubtable  spearman : 
"Brave  as  thou  art,  vEneas,  thy  task  methinks  were  a  hard  one,  (620) 
All  to  destroy  who  against  thee  in  arms  shall  come.    Thou  art  mortal, 
This  remember,  and  wait  thine  hour,  which  sure  will  overtake  thee. 
And  if,  exulting  in  pride  as  thou  stand'st,  on  thy  valour  relying, 
Merion's  spear  (as  well  it  may)  should  light  on  thy  bosom, 
Mine  were  the  boast,  but  thine  the  downward  journey  to  Hades." 

Thus  he  spake,  but  the  valiant  son  of  Mencetius  rebuked  him  : 
"Merion!  why  these  words,  so  ill  beseeming  thy  valour? 
Think  not  sarcastic  words,  my  friend,  will  scatter  the  Trojans 
Crowding  around  yon  corse  !    They  must  take  their  places  beside  it. 
Deeds  are  the  one  thing  needful  in  war,  and  words  in  the  council;  (630) 
Here  men  come  not  together  to  talk.    Our  bus'ness  is  fighting." 

Speaking  thus  he  advanced,  and  the  godlike  Merion  followed. 
Then,  as  within  some  mountain  dell  the  crash  of  the  forests, 
Falling  beneath  the  woodman's  axe,  uprouses  the  echoes, 
So  through  that  wide-expanded  plain  the  clash  of  their  weapons 
Echoed,  from  brass,  from  tough  bull-hide,  from  breastplate  and  buckler, 
Battered,  and  hacked  with  swords,  and  pierced  with  two-edged  lances. 

Now  not  his  nearest  friend  would  have  known  the  form  of  Sarpedon, 
Covered  from  head  to  foot  with  dust  and  blood ;  and  with  lances 
Pierced    and    disfigured,  from    many  a  hand  in  the  combat  around 
him.  (640) 

Still  round  his  corse  they  gathered  in  crowds,  like  flies  which  by  myriads 
Gather  and  hum  in  the  stalls  round  the  milking  pails  in  the  spring-tide, 
What  time  the  milk  is  sweet  and  rich  and  the  pails  overflowing. 
Thus  round  the  corse  they  gathered  in  crowds ;  wfcile  not  for  an  instant 
Zeus  from  the  fight  his  radiant  eyes  averted,  but  kept  them 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  361 

On  the  contending  heroes  fixed,  in  his  bosom  revolving 
All  the  impending  fates  of  Patroclus  brave :  for  he  doubted 
Whether   the   mighty  Hedlor   should  conquer  at  once  and  should 

stretch  him 
Lifeless  on  godlike  Sarpedon's  remains,  and  strip  from  his  shoulders 
All  his  resplendent  arms,  or,  prolonging  the  arduous  struggle,       (650) 
Deaths  he  should  heap  on  deaths,  and  swell  the  number  of  viclims. 
This  he  at  length  resolved,  as  the  better  course;  that  Patroclus, 
[Servant  brave  of  the  mighty  Achilles,  offspring  of  Peleus,] 
Once  more  should  turn  to  flight  the  Trojans  and  crest-waving  Hector, 
Drive  them  back  to  the  city,  and  strew  the  plain  with  their  corses. 
Therefore  he  chilled  the  heart  and  enfeebled  the  courage  of  Hector. 
First  of  the  host  to  his  car  he  sprang,  and  called  on  the  Trojans 
All  to  follow  his  flight,  for  fate,  he  perceived,  was  against  him. 
Then  resisted  no  longer  the  Lycian  host;  but  in  terror  (659) 

All  of  them  turned  and  fled ;  for  they  saw  the  form  of  their  sov'reign 
Pierced  to  the  heart,  and  o'erwhelmed  with  the  pile  of  dead;  for 

upon  him 
Many  had  fall'n,  crushed  down  by  the  stern  control  of  Kronion. 
Then  did  the  Greeks  from  Sarpedon  his  brazen  and  glittering  armour 
Tear,  and  Mencetius'  valiant  son  to  his  friends  and  companions 
Gave  it  in  charge,  from  the  field  to  the  hollow  ships  to  convey  it, 

Now  to  Apollo  spake  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion : 
"  Haste  thee  !  Phoebus  belov'd.    Draw  forth  the  corse  of  Sarpedon 
Out  from  the  spears  and  darts,  and  his  limbs  from  the  gore  that 

defiles  them 
Cleanse ;  and  far  from  the  field  with  copious  streams  from  the  river 
Lave;    with    ambrosia    anoint;    and    clothe    them  with    garments 

immortal.  '  (670) 

Then  to  my  messengers,  Sleep  and  Death,  twin  brothers,  consign  him, 
Silent  and  swift,  who  will  bear  him  away,  and  gently  restore  him 
Back  to  his  native  realm,  his  wide  and  prosperous  Lycia; 
There  shall  his  brethren  and  friends  fit  rites  perform,  and  the  honours 
Due  to  the  dead  bestow :  the  funereal  mound  and  the  column. 
Thus  he  spake,  and  Phoebus  obeyed  the  command  of  his  Parent. 
Darting  at  once  from  Ida's  height  to  the  midst  of  the  combat, 


362  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 


Forth  from  the  weapons  the  corse  he  drew  of  mighty  Sarpedon ; 
Far  from  the  field  then  bore  it,  with  plenteous  streams  from  the  river 
Laved  ;  with  ambrosia  anointed  ;  and  clothed  it  in  raiment  immortal. 
Then  to  the  messengers,  Sleep  and  Death,  twin-brothers,  consigned  it, 
Silent  and  swift,  who  bore  him  away,  and  gently  restored  him 
Back  to  his  native  earth,  his  wide  and  prosperous  Lycia. 

Eagerly  now  Patroclus,  his  steeds  Automedon  cheering, 
Dashed   in   pursuit   of    the   Lycians   and   Trojans,    and   rushed   on 

destruction. 
Rash,  and  misled !    Had  he  called  to  mind  the  command  of  Achilles, 
Surely  that  fatal  hour  and  the  blackness  of  death  had  been  spared  him. 
Higher  however  than  mortal  man's  are  the  thoughts  of  the  Father, 
He,  when  he  will,  discomfits  the  brave — in  the  moment  of  conquest 
Snatches   the   palm   from    hands   which   himself  hath   strengthened 
to  win  it :  (690) 

So  did  he  strengthen  Mencetius'  son,  and  filled  him  with  courage. 

Say,  Patroclus  !  whom  first,  whom  last,  didst  thou  hurl  into  Orcus, 
Urged  on,  thyself,  by  fate,  and  called  by  the  Gods  to  destruction. 
First  Adrestus,  Autonous  next,  and  mighty  Echeclus, 
Perimus,  then  great  Megas'  son,  Melanippus,  Epistor, 
Elasus  next,  then  Mulius  fell,  then  valiant  Pylartes. 
Fall'n,  their  fellows  dispersed  in  flight,  each  seeking  his  safety. 

Then  had  the-  lofty  gates  of  Troy  to  the  sons  of  Achaia 
Bowed,  and  to  raging  Patroclus'  brandish'd  spear,  and  his  prowess, 
Had  not  Apollo  himself  interposed,  and  high  on  the  rampart     (700) 
Taken  his  stand,  with  wrathful  intent,  and  assisted  the  Trojans. 
Thrice  did  Patroclus  a  buttress  attempt  to  scale,  but  Apollo 
Thrice  repelled  the  assault,  and  thrust  him  back  as  he  mounted, 
Striking  his  beaming  shield  with  the  hand  of  a  God.    But  a  fourth  time, 
When  he  renewed  the  attempt  with  unearthly  courage  and  vigour, 
Broke  forth,  in  threat'ning  tone,  these  warning  words  from  the  godhead : 
"Heav'n-born  Patroclus  !  retire  !  nor  vainly  deem  to  thy  weapon 
Fate  hath  decreed  the  fall  of  the  lofty  city  of  Ilion. 
Not  to  Achilles  himself  will  it  yield,  though  far  thy  superior." 
Thus  he  spake.    Then  far  from  the  wall  Patroclus  retreated,   (710) 
Dreading  the  wrath  to  provoke  of  the  bright  far-darting  Apollo. 


Book  XVI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  363 

Hector  the  while  at  the  Scsean  gate  remained  in  his  chariot, 
Doubtful  whether  again  in  the  fight  to  mix,  or,  retreating, 
Gather  the  people  in  safety  within  the  walls  of  the  city. 
This  in  his  mind  debating,  beside  him  Phoebus  Apollo 
Stood;  assuming  the  shape  of  a  hero,  valiant  and  youthful, 
Asius :  uncle  was  he  of  Hector,  tamer  of  horses, 
Hecuba's  own  dear  brother;  to  Dymas  his  father  in  Phrygia 
Born,  where  he  dwelt  in  his  wealth,  on  the  fertile  bank  of  Sangarius. 
Taking  his  form,  to  Hector  Apollo  addressed  his  remonstrance  :  (720) 
"  Hector !  ill  it  beseems  thee  to  stand  aloof  from  the  combat. 
Were  but  our  ranks  reversed,  and  I  thy  superior  in  station, 
Soon  wouidst  thou  learn  to  repent  having  left  thy  post  in  the  battle. 
Up,  then,   and    charge    with  the  might   of  thy  powerful  steeds  on 

Patroclus, 
Not  without  hope  to  slay  him,  should  Phoebus  lead  thee  to  glory." 
Thus  spake  the  God,  and  left  him,  and  plunged  in  the  thick  of 

the  conflict. 
Hector  then  unto  valiant  Cebriones  turned,  and  commanded 
Into  the  battle  his  bounding  steeds  to  lash :  and  Apollo 
Passed  on  before  him  and  entered  the  crowd,  and  spread  through 

the  Argives 
Dread  and  confusion ;  glory  preparing  for  Troy  and  for  Hector.    (730) 
He,  neglecting  the  rest  of  the  Greeks,  nor  staying  to  slay  them, 
Charged  on  Patroclus  direct  with  all  the  speed  of  his  horses; 
Who  when  he  saw  him  approach  at  once  sprang  down  from  his  chariot. 
Holding  his  spear  in  his  left,  in  his  right  hand  grasped  he  a  fragment, 
Heavy  and  rugged,  of  marble  white,  which  hardly  it  closed  on. 
Putting  forth  all  his  might,  he  hurled  the  stone,  and  it  missed  not, 
Nor  was  it  slow  in  its  flight.    On  Cebriones'  forehead  it  lighted, 
Hector's  charioteer  (the  offspring  of  glorious  Priam, 
Though  from  unwedded  love),  who  held  the  reins  of  his  horses. 
Crushing  his  brows  it  fell :  nor  the  solid  bone  of  his  forehead       (740) 
Aught  availed  to  resist  it.     His  eyes,  forced  out  from  their  orbits, 
Dropped  at  his  feet  in  the  dust ;  and  headlong  down  like  a  diver 
Forward   he   plunged    from   the   rich-wrought   seat ;    and   his    spirit 

forsook  him. 


364  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVI. 

Bitterly  mocking  arose  thy  derisive  taunt,  O  Patroclus ! 
"Gods!   how   expertly   he   dives!   what  a  nimble   and   clever  per- 
former ! 
Had  he  this  feat  performed  in  the  fishy  sea,  we  had  seen  him, 
Bringing  up  oysters  enough  to  feast  us  all.     He  might  safely 
Plunge  from  the  side  of  a  ship,  let  the  sea  be  never  so  stormy. 
Here  he  exhibits  his  skill  by  a  plunge  from  the  seat  of  his  chariot. 
One   thing    is    sure :    the    Trojans    have    excellent    divers    among 
them."  (75°) 

Thus  he  spake,  and  rushed  on  the  prostrate  chief,  as  a  lion 
Fierce,   who    the    fold    having    ravaged,    at    length    receiving    his 

death-wound, 
Falls  to  his  own  impetuous  force  and  courage  a  victim. 
Eagerly  thus  thou  sprang'st  on  the  prostrate  hero,  Patroclus ! 

Hector  beheld,  and  leaped  to  the  ground  at  once  from  his  chariot, 
Then,  as  above  some  slaughtered  stag  in  the  mountain  recesses 
Two  fierce  lions  in  deadly  struggle  contend  for  the  carcase, 
Burning  with  equal  rage,  and  by  equal  hunger  incited; 
So  did  these  two  great  lords  of  the  fight  o'er  Cebriones  prostrate, 
Mighty  Patroclus,  Mencetius'  son,  and  illustrious  Hector,  (760) 

Aim  at  each  other  in  deadly  hate  their  pitiless  weapons. 

Hector   the   head   of  the   corpse   had  seized,  and   his  grasp  he 
relaxed  not; 
Brave  Patroclus  the  feet  held  fast ;  and  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans 
Crowded  around  them  both)  and  engaged  in  desperate  conflict. 
As  when  within  some  mountain-gorge,  "dense-wooded  and  gloomy, 
Eurus  and  Notus  contend  which  most  shall  shatter  the  forest; 
Clashing  together,  the  beech,  the  ash,  and  the  wide-spreading  cornel, 
Rude  intermingle  their  struggling  boughs,  and  the  roar  of  the  branches 
Deepens  around,  and  the  mingling  crash  of  the  prostrated  thicket : 
Thus  did  the  Trojans  and  thus  the  Greeks  in  mutual  slaughter     (770) 
Close  with  a  rush,  all  thoughts  of  flight  or  safety  dismissing. 
Many  a  pointed  spear  round  the  falPn  Cebriones  bristled  ; 
Many  a  winged  shaft  leapt  swift  and  sharp  from  the  bowstring ; 
Many  a  weighty  stone  came  thund'ring  on  shield  and  on  buckler 
There  as  they  fought :  and  a  whirlwind  of  dust  fell  thick  on  the  hero, 


Book  XVI.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


365 


Wide  outstretched  as  he  lay,  all  his  charioteering  forgotten. 

Now  while  the  sun  in  his  daily  course  mid-heav'n  was  ascending, 
So  long  alike  in  either  host  were  the  wounds  and  the  slaughter, 
But  when  his  noon  was  passed,  and  his  path  to  the  west  was  declining, 
Greece  had  the  best  of  the  fight,  and  in  fate's  despite  was  triumphant. 
Forth    from   the   weapons   the   corpse    they   drew    from    the   press 

of  the  Trojans,  (7 Si) 

And  from  its  shoulders  tore  the  bright  and  glittering  armour. 
Then  on  the  Trojans  Patroclus  rushed,  dire  thoughts  in  his  bosom 
Harbouring.     Thrice  he  charged  with  the  might  of  infuriate  Ares, 
Dreadfully  shouting  :  and  thrice  did  he  strike  down  nine  of  his  foemen. 
But  when  with  more  than  mortal  force  he  rushed  on,  a  fourth  time, 
Then,  O  Patroclus  I  drew  to  its  close  the  career  of  thy  glory. 
Phoebus    approached   thee,   forcing  his   way  through   the   thick   of 

the  conflict, 
Dreadful !  Him  through  the  tumult  advancing  Patroclus  perceived  not, 
Such,  and  so  dense  the  mist  that  his  form  and  features surrounded :  (790) 
Standing  behind  him,  a  blow  on  his  back  he  dealt,  and  his  shoulders 
Broad,  with  the  flat  of  his  hand.     Then  his  eyes  swam  giddy  and 

dazzling; 
Off  from  his  head  the  helmet  flew,  by  Phoebus  Apollo 
Smitten ;  and  clatt'ring  it  rolled  beneath  the  feet  of  the  horses. 
Soiled  in  the  dust  and  blood  was  that  lofty  crest,  which  aforetime 
Never  had  known  the  touch  of  earth,  which  dust  and  defilement 
Never  before  disgraced :  for  o'er  mighty  Achilles  its  plumage 
Waved,  and  the  godlike  head  and  beauteous  face  of  the  hero 
Shaded  :  henceforward  on  Hector's  head  to  wave  and  to  glisten,  (799) 
Granted  by  Zeus  for  a  while,  till  a  speedy  death  should  overtake  him. 
Flew  from  his  hand  in  shivers  the  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin, 
Heavy,   and    stubborn,   and    huge,   and    brazen-tipp'd.     From    his 

shoulders 
Glided  to  earth  his  all-protecting  shield  with  its  baldric. 
Down  fell  his  breastplate  too,  stript  off  by  Phoebus  Apollo. 

Then  was  his  soul  disturbed.    His  knees  'gan  tremble  beneath  him. 
Dazed  and   astound    he    stood.      Then    approached   a   Dardanian 

warrior,

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XVI. 


And  in  his  back,  his  shoulders  betwixt,  a  wound  he  inflicted. 
This  was  Euphorbus,  Panthous'  son,  who  his  youthful  companions 
Far  surpassed,  as  a  spearman,  a  runner  swift,  and  a  rider,       (809) 
One  who  already  full  twenty  warriors  had  hurled  from  their  chariots, 
New  to  the  use  of  his  own,  yet  learning  the  practice  of  warfare. 
Such  was  the  man  who  smote  thee  first  with  his  lance,  O  Patroclus  ! 
Yet  he  subdued  thee  not :  and  he  slunk  away  to  his  comrades, 
First  having  plucked  from  the  wound  his  ashen  spear  :  for  Patroclus, 
All  unarmed  as  he  stood  and  naked,  he  feared  to  encounter. 

Wounded,   disarmed   by   the    God,   Patroclus  withdrew  from   the 

combat, 
Back  to  the  ranks  of  his  friends,  in  sore  distress  and  confusion. 
Hector,  when  this  he  marked,  when  he  saw  the  godlike  Patroclus 
Out  of  the  fight  to  his  friends  retiring,  wounded  and  bleeding, 
Pushed  through  the   crowd,  approached  him  close,   and  lifting  his 

jav'lin  (820) 

Drove  it  beneath  his  ribs  through  the  flank,  and  it  issued  behind  him  : 
Down  with  a  crash  he  fell,  while  horror  seized  on  the  Grecians. 
As  when  a  lion  and  savage  boar  contend  for  the  mast'ry, 
High  on  a  mountain  slope  when,  burning  with  thirst,  they  encounter 
Close  to  the  edge  of  some  small  rill,  both  longing  to  taste  it; 
Triumphs  at  length  o'er  his  panting  foe  the  might  of  the  lion : 
Thus,  after  many  a  warrior  slain,  the  son  of  Mencetius 
Yielded  his  life  at  length  to  the  conqu'ring  jav'lin  of  Hector, 
Who  in  exulting  tones  his  prostrate  foeman  accosted : 
"Where  is  thy  boast,  Patroclus  !  insulter  vain  !  that  our  city        (830) 
Soon  thou  wouldst  overwhelm,  and  carry  the  matrons  of  Troia 
Bond-slaves,  torn  from  their  homes,  in  your  ships  to  the  land  of 

your  fathers? 
Here  are  the  steeds  of  Hector,  who  bear  their  lord  to  the  battle, 
Swift  of  foot,  to  defend  them; — and  Hector  himself  with  his  jav'lin, 
First  of  the  warriors  of  Troy,  who  hath  saved  them  now,  and  will 

save  them 
Still,  from  that  evil  day :  while  thou  shalt  fatten  the  vultures. 
Little,  unhappy  wretch !  hath  the  might  of  Achilles  availed  thee, 
Much  he  enjoined,  no  doubt,  when  himself  inactive,  he  sent  thee

Forth  to  the  fight.     'Return  not/  (methi?iks  I  hear  him)  'Patroclus  ! 
Back  to  my  hollow  ships,  till  the  arms  of  death-dealing  Hector,    (840) 
Torn  from  his  bleeding  breast,  thou  bring  me  back  as  thy  trophy.'' 
Such,  perchance,  were  his  words.     And  thou,  in  thy  folly,  believ'dst 
them." 

Thus,  with  feeble  and  fainting  voice  responded  Patroclus  : 
"  Hector !    boast  if  thou  wilt.     To  almighty  Zeus  and  Apollo 
Ow'st  thou  this  easy  success.    'Tis  they  who  have  conquered  Patroclus, 
Who  from  my  shoulders  stripped  my  arms,  and  exposed  me  defenceless. 
Twenty  such  men  as  thou  might  have  striv'n  in  vain  to  oppose  me ; 
All  had  I  conquered, — all  beneath  my  spear  would  have  perished. 
Fate  was  against  me  : — fate  and  the  vengeful  offspring  of  Leto, 
And    among   men,   Euphorbus.     Thy   part   wras   the   third,    and  the 
meanest.  (850) 

One  more  word  may  I  speak  ;  and  well  wilt  thou  do  to  observe  it. 
Brief  is  the  term  which  remains  of  thine  own  career :  for  already 
Fate  unsparing,  and  gloomy  death,  stand  close  at  thy  elbow, 
Doomed  as  thou  art  to  fall  by  the  hand  of  peerless  Achilles." 

Thus  while  he  spake  the  shadow  of  death  came  gath'ring  around 
him, 
Quitting  its  mortal  abode,  his  soul  passed  downward  to  Hades, 
Wailing  its  lot,  relinquishing  youth,  and  beauty,  and  manhood. 
Hector  awhile  stood  o'er  him,  and  thus  addressed  the  departed  : 
"  Wherefore  this  dismal  announcement  of  coming  death  ?    O  Patroclus ! 
May  not  Achilles  himself,  though  znighty,  and  born  of  a  Goddess,  (860) 
Yield  up  his  life  as  well,  beneath  my  conquering  jav'lin?" 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  brazen  spear  from  the  wound  he  extracted, 
Planting  his  heel  on  his  bosom,  and  spurning  the  corse  from  the  weapon : 
Then,  with  recovered  lance,  on  Automedon  rushed,  in  the  chariot 
Seated,  and  guiding  the  steeds  of  iEacus'  mighty  descendant, 
Eager  to  slay  him.     But  him  th'  immortal  coursers  of  Peleus 
(Gift  of  the  gods)  bore  far  away,  disappointing  his  purpose.

A/TIGHTY  Patroclus'  fall,  by  the  hostile  spears  of  the  Trojans, 
•*■         Passed  not  unmarked  by  Atreus'  warlike  son  Menelaiis. 
Sheathed  in  refulgent  brass,  to  the  front  he  advanced,  and  around  him 
Stalked,  with  protecting  stride;   as  a  heifer,  newly  a  mother, 
Paces  around  her  first-born  calf,  with  piteous  lowing. 
Thus  round  Patroclus  strode  the  fair-hair'd  chief  Menelaiis, 
Holding  before  him  his  lance,  and  the  smooth  round  orb  of  his  buckler, 
Ready  and  eager  to  slay  whoe'er  might  advance  to  attack  him. 
Neither  did  Panthus'  valiant  son,  the  spearman  Euphorbus, 
Cease   to   remember   Patroclus    slain ;    but   approached,    and   before 
him  (10) 

Stood,  while  thus  he  addressed  Menelaiis,  favour'd  of  Ares : 
"  Atreus'  heaven-born  son,  Menelaiis,  prince  of  thy  nation  ! 
Off  with  thee  !  quit  yon  corse  !  and  relinquish  its  spoils  to  their  owner. 
None  of  our  Trojan  host  or  brave  auxiliar  forces 
Wounded  Patroclus,  before  with  my  spear  I  smote  him  in  battle. 
Seek  not  to  rob  me  then  of  my  glory,  due  from  the  Trojans, 
Lest  with  another  stroke  of  my  spear  I  dispatch  thee  to  join  him" 

Thus  then,  indignant,  replied  the  fair-hair'd  chief  Menelaiis  : 
"Father  Zeus  !  and  ye  PowWs  of  Heaven  I  what  insolent  boasting  ! 
Why  !  not  a  panther  with  half  such  unbridled  wrath,  not  a  lion,      (20) 
Not  an  untameable,  fierce,  and  destructive  boar,  in  whose  bosom 
Fury,  and  wild  outbursting  rage  unceasingly  harbour, 
Swells,  as  these  sons  of  Panthus  display,  these  marvellous  spearmen  !

372  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Yet  not  long  withstood  me  the  might  of  proud  Hyperenor, 
Whom  in  the  bloom  of  his  youth  I  slew ;  who  attacked,  and  provoked 

me, 
Calling  me  coward,  and  feeblest  of  all  our  Danaan  warriors. 
Borne  on  no  feet  of  his  own,  /  ween,  he  returned  to  his  parents 
Honoured,  and  loving  wife,  to  rejoice  their  hearts  with  his  triu?nphf 
So  will  I  treat  thee  too,  if  thou  tempt  my  might,  and  oppose  me, 
Standing  thy  ground.     Be  advised.     Retreat;  and  among  thy  com- 
panions (30) 
Skulk,  and  be  lost  in  the  crowd  ;  lest  evil  and  mischief  befall  thee. 
Warnings  the  wise  receive,  but  mishap  is  the  teacher  of  folly." 

Thus  he  spake,  but  in  vain :    for  thus  responded  Euphorbus : 
"  Now  for  this  act,  Menelaiis,  my  vengeful  spear  shall  requite  thee  ; 
Thee,  who  hast  slain  my  brother,  and  thus  canst  boast  of  his  slaughter; 
Widowed  his  new-wed  bride,  and  sent  her  to  weep  in  her  chamber ; 
Heaping  unspeakable  grief  on  the  hearts  of  his  agonized  parents. 
This  shall  afford  some  solace,  some  small  relief  to  their  sorrow, 
When,  having  stripped  thine  arms,  and  struck  thine  head  from  thy 

shoulders, 
Home,  as  an  off'ring  to  Panthusand  noble  Phrontis,  I  bear  them.   (40) 
Now  must  we  fight  it  out  to  the  bitter  end,  and  the  question, 
If  thou  be  coward  or  brave,  shall  thus  full  soon  be  decided." 

Thus  as  he  spake  he  thrust  at  the  smooth  round  orb  of  his  buckler : 
Thrust,  but  pierced  not  the  polished  brass  :  for  the  point  of  his  weapon 
Turned  on  the  mighty  shield.     Next,  Atreus'  son,  Menelaiis, 
First  having  prayed  to  Zeus,  rushed  on,  uplifting  his  jav'lin. 
Just  in  the  act  of  receding  a  step,  the  spear  through  his  gullet 
Pierced.     Urged  on  from  behind,  by  the  forceful  hand  of  Atreides, 
Out  through  the  tender  neck  stood  forth  the  point  of  the  weapon. 
Down  he  fell  with  a  crash,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him.        (50) 
Dabbled  in  blood  were  his  beauteous  locks,  which  the  Graces  might 

envy, 
Each  fair  curl  with  circlets  of  gold  entwined,  and  of  silver, 
As  when  in  some  sequestered  vale,  all  gurgling  with  fountains, 
Grows  a  young  olive,  nursed  with  care  by  the  hand  of  the  planter ; 
Waving  in  every  breeze  its  graceful  and  silvery  tresses,

Beauteous  it  stands  and  gay,  with  its  snowy  profusion  of  blossom, 

Till  with  a  sudden  wrench,  the  ruthless  force  of  the  tempest 

Tears  it  away,  and  stretches  its  prostrate  form  on  the  furrow  : 

Thus  lay  Euphorbus,  Panthus'  son,  by  stern  Menelaus, 

Atreus'  offspring,  slain :  and  the  victor  stripped  off  his  armour.  (60) 

As  when  a  lion,  exulting  in  might,  from  his  lair  in  the  mountains 

Springs  on"  the  pasturing  herd  and  seizes  the  best  of  the  heifers  : 

First  with  his  monstrous  fangs  he  breaks  the  neck  of  his  victim, 

Then  o'er  the  carcase  stands  and  laps  up  the  blood  and  the  entrails, 

Tearing  his  flesh ;  while  dogs  and  herdsmen  stand  at  a  distance 

Shouting  and  barking  with  all  their  might :  nor  dare  to  approach  him 

Near,   or  disturb  his  horrid  meal,  all  pallid  with  terror; 

Thus  not  one  of  his  Trojan  friends  could  summon  the  courage 

Boldly  to  face  Menelaus,  and  rescue  the  corse  of  their  comrade. 

Then  had  he  lightly  borne  those  spoils  away,   but  Apollo,        (70) 

Pitying  his  hapless  fate,  to  Atreides  grudged  their  possession ; 

Hector  he  sought,  and  aroused  the  martial  fire  of  his  nature. 

Taking  the  form  of  Mentes,  the  brave  Ciconian  leader, 

Near  him  he  stood,  and  in  hasty  and  urgent  Avords  he  addressed  him  : 

"  Cease  to  pursue,  O  Hector,  an  unattainable  object : 

Chasing  Achilles'  steeds  thou  but  wasfst  thy  force.      Couldst  thou  take 

them, 
They  by  no  hand  of  mortal  man  will  submit  to  be  guided  : 
None  but  Achilles,  goddess-born,  may  hope  to  control  them. 
Atreus'  warlike  son  meanwhile,  the  prince  Menelaus, 
Guarding  Patroclus'  corse%  has  encountered  valiant  Euphorbus,      (80) 
One  of  our  noblest  Trojan  chiefs,  and  slain  him  in  battle." 

Thus  spake  the  God ;  and  departing  was  lost  in  the  crowd  of  the 

warriors. 
Deep  fell  the  shadow  of  grief  on  the  saddened  spirit  of  Hector ; 
Casting  around  him  a  searching  glance,   he  perceived  through  the 

tumult, 
Here,  Menelaus  bearing  the  spoils,  there,  hapless  Euphorbus 
Stretched  on  the  plain,  and  the  gore  from  his  wound  still  streaming 

around  him. 
Sheathed  in  refulgent  brass  to  the  rescue  he  rushed,  and  before  him 


374  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Sent  forth  a  fearful  shout.     Like  the  raging  fires  of  Hephaestus, 
Fierce,  unextinguished,  he  flew.     Menelaiis  warned  by  his  outcry, 
Sore  disturbed,  communed  with  his  heart  as  he  saw  him  approach- 
ing :  (90) 
"  What  must  I  do  ?     If  I  quit  these  beauteous  arms,  and  Patroclus 
Leave  undefended,  whose  blood  in  my  cause  has  been  shed — for  my 

honour — 
Will  not  each  Greek  who  beholds  \tfor  ever  hate  and  despise  me  ? 
But,  if,  constrained  by  sense  of  shame  I  remain,  and  the  Trojans 
All,  with  Hector,  encounter,  alone  I  shall  stand  and  surrounded  1 
For  with  their  whole  array,  lo  !  crest-waving  Hector  advances. 
Yet  what  need  of  debate  ?  and  why  this  conflict  within  me  ? 
Surely  when  mortal  man  against  fate  shall  strive,  and  in  battle 
Stand,  against  one  whom  the  Gods  support,  dire  ills  will  o'erwhelm 

him  : 
Therefore  let  none  of  the  Greeks  too  harshly  deem,  who  shall  see 
me  (IO°) 

Yielding  to  Hector's  might,  whom  a  God  leads  onward  to  conquest. 
Could  I  but  hear  great  Aias'  voice  o'er  the  roar  of  the  battle, 
Back  with  him  would  I  come  and  renew  the  struggle,  regardless 
Ev'n  of  a  God's  opposing  pow'r,  and  bear  to  Achilles 
Sad  Patroclus'  remains.     'Tis  the  best  we  can  hope  to  accomplish." 

Thus  while  he  stood  but  half  resolved,  and  inly  debating, 
On  came  the  Trojan  force,  great  Hector  leading  their  onset, 
Then  reluctant  he  turned  him  round,  and  the  dead  he  abandoned, 
Slowly  retiring  :  ev'n  as  a  lion,  bearded  and  shaggy, 
Who  from  the  stalls  retreats,  when  dogs  around  him  and  hunters 
Gather,  and  press  him  with  clamour  and  spears,  till  his  courage  is 
shaken,  (XI1) 

And  from  the  midst  of  the  fold  he  retires,  indignant  and  sullen; 
Thus  from  Patroclus  withdrew  the  fair-haired  chief  Menelaiis. 
Turning  at  length,  when  in  safety  he  reached  the  ranks  of  his  comrades, 
Anxious  he  gazed  around  for  the  great  Telamonian  hero ; 
Soon  he  perceived  him,  far  remote,  on  the  left  of  the  battle 
Rallying  his  troops ;  for  Phoebus  Apollo  had  scattered  among  them 
Panic  and  wild  dismay — till  their  chief  resto?-ed  them  to  order. 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  375 

Quickly  he  ran  to  the  place,  and  arriving,  thus  he  addressed  him  : 
"  Aias  !    hither,  my  friend  !    Let  us  hasten  to  rescue  Patroclus       (120) 
Slain ;  if  at  least  his  naked  corse  we  may  bear  to  Achilles ; 
Naked — for  crest-waving  Hector  already  possesses  his  armour." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  aroused  the  martial  spirit  of  Aias. 
Forth  they  sped,  and  made  for  the  spot  where  Patroclus  was  lying. 
Hector    they  found   with    the   corpse   despoiled   of   its   beauteous 

armour, 
Dragging  it  off :  for  he  meant  to  strike  the  head  from  its  shoulders, 
And  to  the  dogs  of  Troy  as  a  prey  to  cast  forth  the  body. 
Just  then  Aias  arrived,  his  tow'r-like  buckler  advancing : 
Hector  at  once  retired,  and  back  to  the  ranks  of  his  comrades 
Hasted,  and  into  his  chariot  sprang.     But  the  glorious  trophies   (130) 
First  to  his  followers'  care  he  consigned,  to  bear  to  the  city. 
Aias  the  while  o'er  the  dead  the  broad  expanse  of  his  buckler 
Spread,  and  around  him  stalked,  as  about  his  whelps  doth  a  lion, 
Whom  in  the  forest,  leading  them  forth,  the  hunters  encounter, 
When  he  collects  his  might,  and  in  all  his  grimness  of  feature, 
Deep  o'er  his  glaring  eyes  contracts  the  gloom  of  his  eyebrows : 
Thus  did  great  Aias  stalk  round  the  prostrate  form  of  Patroclus. 
Atreus'  son,  by  his  side,  the  warlike  chief  Menelaiis, 
Stood  j  by  a  load  of  grief  his  heart  oppressed  and  embittered. 

Glaucus  now,  Hippolochus'  son,  the  brave  Lycian  leader,     (140) 
Frowning  on  Hector,  addressed  him  in  words  severe  and  reproachful : 
" Hector!  a  hero  in  outward  show,  thou  art  wanting  in  courage. 
How  didst  thou  win  thy  fame  ?    Not,  surely,  by  always  retreating  ! 
Henceforth,  how  to  defend  thy  city  'twere  well  thou  consider, 
With  thy  own  native  Trojan  troops,  alone  and  unaided ; 
For,  be  assured,  not  a  Lycian  now  will  fight  with  the  Grecians, 
Or  for  the  city  strike  one  blow.     'Tis  thankless,  for  ever, 
Thus  unsupported,  to  waste  our  strength  in  perpetual  conflict. 
How  can  we  ever  expect  that  a  meaner  man  thou  wilt  living        (149) 
Aid,  or  defend  when  dead,  when  Sarpedon,  thy  guest  and  companion, 
Recreant!  thou  left'st  to  the  Argive  spoilers,  a  prey  and  a  booty : 
Whom,  while  living,  to  thee  and  thy  nation  a  stay  and  a  bulwark, 
Dead,  thou  hast  suffered  the  Grecian  dogs  to  tear  and  disfigure. 


376  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

If  there  be  one  then,  who  heeds  my  words,  of  our  Lycian  warriors, 
Home  let  him  haste  and  abandon  Troy  to  impending  destruction. 
Now,  ev'n  now,  if  the  Trojans  had  spirit  or  valour  within  them, 
Aught  of  that  dauntless  force  which  heroes  who  fight  for  their  country 
Feel  in  their  hearts  when  they  meet  their  foes  in  desperate  conflict, 
Yet  might  we  easily  bear  Patroclus'  corse  into  Ilion. 
Him  could  we  drag  from  the  fight  to  the  lofty  city  of  Priam —     (J6o) 
Once  could  we  carry  him  off  from  the  field  and  secure  his  possession — 
Soon  would  the  Greeks  surrender  the  beauteous  arms  of  Sarpedon, 
Soon  should  we  see  restored  his  lov'd  remains,  as  a  ransom ; 
This  might  we  do,  having  slain  the  companion  and  friend  of  a  hero, 
Bravest  of  all  the  Greeks,  whose  troops  are  the  best  of  their  warriors. 
But  in  the  presence  of  Aias  the  noble-hearted,  thy  spirit 
Quails,  and  to  stand  before  him  and  face  to  face  in  the  battle, 
Meet  him,  thou  dar'st  not  attempt.     He  is  braver  than  thou,  and 
thou  know'st  it." 
Frowning,  the  lord  of  the  waving  crest,  great  Hector,  responded : 
"  Glaucus !  methinks  from  one  like  thee  such  words  are  o'erweening.(  1 70) 
Ever,  my  friend  !  till  now,  I  believed  thee  discreet,  and  in  wisdom 
Far  surpassing  the  dwellers  in  fertile  Lycia's  region. 
Now  must  I  deem  thee  beside  thyself,  such  a  word  to  have  uttered, 
As  that  I  dread  to  encounter  the  huge  proportions  of  Aias. 
War  and  the  thunder  of  chariots  have  nothing  appalling  to  Hector. 
Higher  however  than  mortal  man's  is  the  will  of  Kronion, 
He  at  his  pleasure  confounds  the  brave  : — in  the  moment  of  triumph 
Snatches  the  palm  from  hands  which  himself  has  strengthened  to  win  it. 
Come  with  me,  friend  !  stand  by,  and  judge  for  thyself  of  my  conduct, 
So  shalt  thou  call  me  for  ever  disg?-aced,  for  ever  a  recreant,   (180) 
If  some  few  of  the  Greeks,  who  defend  the  corse  of  Patroclus, 
Learn  not  to  rue  the  day,  how  boldly  soever  they  bear  them." 
Thus  having  spoken,  he  shouted  a  mighty  shout  to  his  foll'wers  : 
"Trojans  and  Lycians  all,  and  ye  brave  Dardanian  warriors, 
Shew  yourselves   men,   my  friends !    Remember   your  prowess  and 

valour. 
Soon  shall  ye  see  me,  arrayed  in  the  arms  of  peerless  Achilles, 
Arms  which  I  stripped  myself  from  the  prostrate  form  of  Patroclus." 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  377 

Crest-waving  Hector,  thus  having  spoken,  quitted  the  combat, 
Hast'ning  away  to  o'ertake  his  train,  who  to  Ilion  were  bearing 
Mighty  Peleides'  arms.    With  speed  he  ran  and  o'ertook  them,    (190) 
Light  of  foot,  ere  far  they  had  passed  on  their  Avay,  and  detained  them. 
There,  from  the  murd'rous  fight  apart,  exchanging  his  armour, 
Back  to  the  sacred  city  his  own  he  dispatched,  with  an  escort, 
Chosen,  of  warlike  men  ;  while  himself  in  the  arms  of  Peleides, 
Blazing,  celestial,  he  decked : — those  arms  to  Peleus  his  father, 
Giv'n  by  th'  immortal  gods.     From  the  aged  king  to  Achilles 
Next  they  came  :  but  the  son  grew  not  old  in  the  arms  of  the  father. 

Him  beholding  afar,  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion, 
Thus  in  the  shining  arms  of  divine  Peleides  accoutred, 
Sadly  his  head  he  shook,  and  thus  communed  with  his  spirit :      (200) 
"Ill-fated  Prince !    No  thought  of  death  o'ershadows  thy  triumph, 
Near  as  thine  end  approaches.     In  arms  celestial  I  see  thee, 
Worn  by  the  bravest  of  mortals,  the  scourge  and  terror  of  all  men  : 
Him,    whose  friend  and  companion,    the   gentle    and   brave,    thou 

hast  slaughtered, 
Stripping  his  arms  in  unseemly  guise  from  his  head  and  his  shoulders. 
Yet  will  I  give  thee  fame,  and  augment  thy  strength  for  a  moment. 
Some  compensation  granting  for  this,  that,  returning  from  battle, 
Ne'er  shall  Andromache  take  from  thy  hands  the  arms  of  Achilles." 

Forward  his  dark  and  awful  brows  he  bent,  and  inclining, 
Nodded.     The  arms  then  closed  round  the  limbs,   and  the  spirit 
of  Ares  (2I°) 

Rushed  on  the  soul  of  Heel  or.     His  form  dilated,  with  vigour 
Swelling,  and  force  immense.     Then  through  th'  auxiliar  squadrons, 
Shouting  aloud  he  passed :    and  all  might  trace  a  resemblance, 
Bright  as  he  beamed,  in  the  glorious  arms  of  mighty  Peleides. 
While,  as  he  went  through  the  ranks,  he  exhorted  each  of  their  leaders — 
Mesthles,  Glaucus  himself,  Thersilochus,  Asteropseus, 
Medon  and  brave  Deisenor,  Hippothous,  Chromius,  Phorcys, 
Ennomus  too,  for  his  augury  famed.     Not  one  he  omitted, 
As  in  these  rapid  a7id  soul-inspiring  words  he  addressed  them  : 
"  Hear  me  !  ye  countless  tribes  of  brave  allies  from  our  frontiers!  (220) 
'Twas  not  to  gather  around  me  a  crowd  of  idle  retainers, 


378  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

That  from  your  several  cities  and  states  I  summoned  you  hither ; 
'Twas  to  defend  with  hearty  zeal,  from  the  warlike  Achaians, 
Troy's  high  state,  and  our  Trojan  wives,  and  innocent  children. 
Looking  to  this,  have  I  lavished  upon  you  our  wealth  and  resources, 
Strait'ning  our  own  supplies,  and  maintaining  you  all  in  abundance ; 
Now  then  be  brave  !  face  round,  and  fight  to  the  death,  or  by  vicYry 
Rescue  your  lives  :  for  such  are  the  stakes  and  chances  of  warfare. 
Whoso  shall  seize  on  the  corse  of  Patroclus  dead,  and  shall  bear  it 
Out  of  the  fight,  to  Troy,  despite  the  resistance  of  Aias,  (23°) 

Him  will  I  grace  with  half  our  spoil,  retaining  the  other; 
So  shall  he  stand,  my  equal  in  gain,  my  equal  in  glory." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  at  once  in  a  mass  they  rushed  on  the  Grecians, 
High  uplifting  their  spears.     Each  warrior  burned  with  impatience, 
Hoping  to  snatch  the  dead  from  the  great  Telamonian  Aias. 
Fools  !  full  many  a  life  o'er  that  prostrate  form  was  relinquished ! 

Aias  then  Menelaiis  addressed,  the  mighty  in  battle  : 
"  Brave  Menelaus  !  my  godlike  friend  !  full  small  is  the  prospect 
Now  that  we  both  shall  escape  alive  from  this  desperate  struggle. 
'Tis  not  so  much  that  I  dread  the  impending  loss  of  Patroclus,    (240) 
Who  to  the  dogs  and  vultures  of  Troy  must  soon  be  abandoned, 
But  for  thy  life  and  my  own  I  fear,  since  both  are  in  danger. 
Lo  !   what  a  whelming  cloud  of  war  comes  gath'ring  around  us. 
Hector  is  there,  and  swift  destruction  waits  on  his  footsteps, 
Call  then  !   shout  for  our  Grecian  chiefs,  if  any  can  hear  thee." 

Brave  Menelaus,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  complying, 
Raised  a  tremendous  shout,  and  thus  he  called  on  the  Argives  : 
"Friends  and  heroes  of  Greece  !  ye  leaders  in  war,  and  in  council ! 
Ye,  who  with  Atreus'  sons,  Menelaus  and  great  Agamemnon, 
Drink  choice  wine  at  the  public  cost,  and  issue  your  orders,         (25°) 
Each  to  his  own  brave  troops — to  whom  Zeus  gives  glory  and  worship — 
111  may  mine  eyes  discern  your  forms,  or  distinguish  the  stations, 
Where  each  one  of  you  fights :    so  wildly  rages  the  battle. 
Some  of  you  come  to  our  aid,  and,  indignant,  lend  your  assistance, 
Dead  Patroclus  to  save  from  the  dogs  and  vultures  of  Ilion." 

Sharp  rang  the  cry  in  the  ears  of  swift  Oilean  Aias, 
And  through  the  fight  in  haste  he  ran ;  coming  first  to  the  rescue. 


Book  XVI L] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.

After  him  mighty  Idomeneus  came,  and  his  faithful  attendant 

Merion,  hardly  inferior  to  death-dealing  Ares  in  combat. 

Who  may  recount  the  names  and  the  number  of  those  who  behind 

them  (260) 

Followed,  and  swelled  the  Grecian  ranks,  restoring  the  battle? 
On  rushed  the  Trojans  in  one  close  phalanx,  headed  by  Hector. 
As  when  a  river,  fed  by  the  rains  of  Zeus,  to  the  ocean 
Hurrying,  meets  at  its  mouth  the  opposing  wave,  which  in  thunder 
Breaking,  recoils,  and  the  echoing  cliffs  a?id  caveims  rebellow, 
Burst  forth  the  roar  of  the  Trojan  assault.     Undaunted  the  Grecians 
Closed  round  Mencetius'  son,  one  thought  their  bosoms  inspiring, 
And  by  their  brazen  shields  protected.     Mighty  Krom'on 
Poured  meanwhile  round  their  heads,  and  round  their  glittering  helmets, 
Darkness  and  mist :  for  while  he  lived,  the  gattaiit  Patroclus,    (270) 
Hated  he  not,  that  faithful  friend  of  mighty  Peleides ; 
Wherefore  he  left  him  not  for  a  prey  to  the  dogs  of  the  Trojans  : 
That  he  abhorred ;  and  urged  on  his  friends  to  fight  and  protect  him. 
At  the  first  onset  recoiled  the  Greeks  from  the  shock  of  the  Trojans ; 
Back  they  withdrew,  and  left  the  dead ;  but  none  of  their  number 
Sank  by  the  Trojan  spears  opprest.     Yet,  unable  to  slay  them, 
Still  they  succeeded  in  dragging  the  corpse ;  though  but  for  a  moment. 
Soon  they  returned  in  force,  for  Aias  quick  to  the  rescue 
Flew,  and  restored  the  battle,  who,  next  to  peerless  Achilles, 
Far  surpassed  the  rest  of  the  Greeks  in  person  and  prowess.   (280) 
Straight  through  the  press  he   charged,   as   some  wild  boar   in  the 

mountain, 
Rushing  among  the  dogs,  and  the  youthful  band  of  the  hunters, 
Easily  scatters  them  all,  and  drives  them  back  through  the  thicket : 
Thus  did  the  mighty  Telamon's  offspring,  glorious  Aias, 
Dashing  among  them,  with  ease  disperse  the  ranks  of  the  Trojans ; 
Where  round  Patroclus  swarming  they  clung,  all  eagerly  longing 
Glory  and  triumph  to  win,  and  to  drag  him  away  to  the  city. 

Foremost  of  all  Hippothoiis,   son  of  Pelasgian  Lethus, 
Seized  on  the  corpse,  and  was  dragging  it  off  through  the  thick  of  the 

combat. 
He  to  its  ankles  had  fastened  a  leathern  thong,  and  had  tied  it    (290) 


380  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Tight  round  the  sinews.     The  Trojans  and  Hector  beheld  it  exulting. 
Fate,  however,  which  nought  might  avert,  came  swiftly  upon  him. 
Telamon's  valiant  son  was  nigh.     Through  the  press  and  the  tumult 
Rushing,  he  drove  his  spear  through  the  brazen  cheeks  of  his  helmet. 
Burst  was  the  casque  in  sunder,  around  the  blade  of  the  weapon, 
Rent  by  the  mighty  spear,  and  the  strong  right  hand  that  impelled  it, 
Mingled  with  blood,  out  poured  his  brains  through  the  cleft ;  and  the 

warrior 
Sank,  and  his  limbs  collapsed.     From  his  grasp  the  feet  of  Patroclus 
Dropped  to  the  ground,  as  his  fingers  relaxed  their  hold,  and  aban- 
doned 
Lay;  and  his  prostrate  form  fell  stretched  in  death  on  the  body,  (300) 
Far  from  Larissa's  fertile  fields;  nor  repaid  to  his  parents 
All  their  nurture  and  tender  care, — for  his  life  was  a  short  one, 
Cropped  in  his  opening  bloom  by  the  ruthless  weapon  of  Aias. 

Hector  in  turn  advanced,  and  at  Aias  darted  his  jav'lin, 
Who,  when  he  saw  the  coming  spear,  inclined,  and  escaped  it 
Barely :  but  Schedius  it  struck,  illustrious  Iphytus'  offspring, 
Bravest  of  all  the  Phocaeans.     In  Panope  famed  he  resided, 
There  was  his  palace ;  there  he  ruled  o'er  a  populous  nation. 
Under  his  collar-bone  was  he  stricken,  and  straight  through  his  bosom 
Piercing,  the  brazen  point  stood  forth  behind  from  his  shoulder;  (310) 
Down  he  fell  with  a  crash,  and  his  armour  rattled  around  him. 
Phorcys,  the  son  of  Phcenops,  Hippothous  bravely  defending, 
Pierced  by  great  Aias'  spear,  resigned  his  life.     On  the  navel 
Lighting,  it  burst  its  way  through  the  brazen  plates  of  his  armour, 
Rending  his  entrails.     He  fell,  and  clutched  the  dust  with  his  fingers. 

Now  were  the  foremost  foes  repulsed.     Ev'n  Hector  retreated. 
Shouted  the  Greeks  in  triumph,  and  rushing  at  once  on  the  corses, 
Phorcys,  Hippothous,  dragged    them    away,  and    stripped  off  their 

armour. 
Then  had  the  Trojans  again  to  the  city  retired,  by  the  Grecians 
Chased  from  the  plain,  and  driv'n  in  cowardly  flight  and co?ifusion  ;  (320) 
Then  had  the  Greeks  by  their  stubborn  strength  and  desperate  valour 
Glory  achieved  in  despite  of  Zeus  himself:  but  Apollo 
Stirred  the  soul  of  iEneas ;  old  Periphas'  features  assuming, 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  381 

Epytis'  son,  the  herald ;  now  stricken  in  years ;  to  his  father 
Well  performing  a  herald's  part;  both  courteous  and  prudent: 
Him  resembling,  Apollo  bespake  the  son  of  Anchises : 
"How  canst  thou  hope,  ^Eneas  !  'gainst  adverse  fortune  to  struggle, 
Ilion's  lofty  city  to  save — (yet  others  have  done  so, 
Firm  in  their  strength,  their  determined  will ; — on  their  valour  relying, 
And  on  the  endless  resource  of  a  brave  and  populous  nation) —  (330) 
If,  while  the  favour  of  Zeus  is  yours,  and  he  aids  not  the  Grecians, 
Trembling  thus  and inaclive  ye  stand,  nor  join  in  the  conflict?" 
Thus  he  spake,  but  ^Eneas  at  once  perceiving  the  Godhead, 
And  of  his  presence  aware,  thus  loudly  shouted  to  Hector : 
"  Hector !  ye  Trojan  chiefs  and  brave  auxiliar  leaders  ! 
Shameful  it  is  to  retreat  from  the  Greeks,  be  they  never  so  warlike, 
Seeking  inglorious  safety  behind  the,  walls  of  the  city. 
Now,  ev'n  now,  some  pow'r  divine  stood  nigh,  and  assured  me 
That  in  all-pow'rful  Zeus  our  cause  hath  a  friend  and  supporter. 
On  then!  again,  to  the  charge;  nor  suffer  the  Greeks  unmolested  (340) 
Back  to  their  tents  and  ships  to  bear  the  remains  of  Patroclus." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  sprang  to  the  front  in  advance  of  his  comrades; 
Soon  were  they  rallied,  and  down  on  the  Greeks  they  poured  in  a  body, 

First  of  the  Greeks,  Leocritus  fell  to  the  spear  of  ./Eneas, 
Son  of  Arisbas,  companion  in  arms  of  brave  Lycomedes. 
Grieving  beheld  Lycomedes  his  comrade's  death;  and  approaching 
Close  to  the  Trojan  ranks,  in  vengeance  sent  forth  his  jav'lin; 
Hippasis'  son,  Apisaon,  it  struck,  a  prince  of  his  nation  : 
Fix'd  in  his  liver  it  stood.     Then  strength  and  vigour  forsook  him. 
He  from  Paeonia's  fertile  realm,  the  best  and  the  bravest        (350) 
Next  to  his  chief  was  reckoned,  the  warlike  Asteropseus. 
Grieving  beheld  that  chief  his  comrade's  fall,  and  advancing 
Rushed  at  once  on  the  Greeks,  with  an  eager  longing  for  vengeance. 
Vain  was  the  effort.     The  Greeks  stood  close  conjoined,  with  their 

bucklers 
Fenced  in  on  every  side,  round  the  corse,  protending  their  lances. 
Aias  among  them  went  and  came,  and  gave  forth  his  orders ; 
None  of  the  Greeks  he  suffered  to  pass  to  the  rear  and  desert  it, 
None  to  advance  beyond  their  line  and  fight  for  distinction: 


382  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

But  in  a  close  compacted  mass  stand  firm  and  defend  it.        (359) 
Such  were  his  orders,  and  well  obeyed.      But  the  carnage  around  them 
Swelled,  and  the  earth  ran  red  with  gore,  as,  heaped  up  together, 
Trojans  and  brave  allies  were  piled,   with  many  a  Grecian. 
Not  without  Grecian  blood  was  that  battle  fought;  though  on  their 

side 
Fewer  by  far  were  slain :  for  with  mutual  aid  and  protection 
All  stood  stoutly  together,  and  each  supported  his  comrade. 
Thus,  like  a  blazing  fire,  the  conflict  raged.     In  the  heavens 
Seemed  as  if  hardly  the  sun  were  safe,  or  the  moon  :  for  a  darkness 
Deep,  as  of  gath'ring  cloud  or  mist,  had  covered  the  warriors 
All,  who  fought  round  the  lifeless  corse  of  the  son  of  Mencetius. 
Ev'ry where  else  the  Trojans  and  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia 
Fought  unembarrassed  and  free  in  the  light  of  day :   and  the  sun- 
beams (37 1) 
Glowing  and  bright  o'er  the  plain  were  poured.     Not  a  cloud  on  the 

mountains 
Hung  in  the  clear  blue  sky,  or  o'ershadowed  the  field,  where  the  armies 
Fought  with  less  fury,  and  paused  for  rest,  or  retired  to  a  distance 
Shunning  each  other's  spears.     But.there,  in  the  centre,  was  darkness 
Deep'ning  the  horrors  of  war.     There  the  cruel  sword  and  the  jav'lin 
Reeked  with  the  blood  of  the  brave.    Two  only,  chiefs  of  distinction, 
Fought  ?iot  there.     Thrasymedes  and  bold  Antilochus  knew  not 
Yet  that  the  peerless  Patroclus  had  fall'n  in  fight.     They  believed  him 
Still  in  the  battle's  front  victorious,  routing  the  Trojans.  (380) 

These  now  saw  with  amaze  their  comrades  slain,  and  the  Argives 
Turning  to  flight — for  they  fought  apart ;  so  Nestor  commanded, 
When  from  the  sable  ships  he  sent  them  forth  to  the  battle; 
All  the  rest,  through  the  live-long  day,  o'er  the  friend  of  Achilles 
Wrestled,  with  ceaseless  toil.     Down  poured  the  sweat  from  their 

features 
Grimed  with  dust.     Each  stalwart  limb  was  strained  with  exertion. 
Feet,  legs,  arms,  half-blinded  eyes  in  that  desperate  struggle 
Hardly  endured  its  stress,  and  reeled,  and  swam  with  exhaustion. 
As  when  some  slaughtered  bull's  tough  hide  to  the  curriers  is  handed, 
Skilled  to  extend  its  folds  and  with  oil  to  supple  and  dress  it,      (390) 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  383 

Round  in  a  ring  they  stand ;  they  tug,  they  strain,  till  the  moisture 
Dries,  and  the  skin  with  the  oil  rubbed  in  grows  supple  and  pliant, 
Stretched  at  all  points  it  yields,  and  expands,  to  the  force  of  the 

dressers : 
Thus  in  small  space,  by  many  surrounded,  hither  and  thither 
Dragged,  lay  Patroclus'  corse  :  the  Trojans  longing  to  bear  it 
Far  away  within  Ilion's  walls,  the  Greeks  to  their  vessels. 
Round  it  arose  a  fierce  and  savage  cry,  and  a  struggle 
Bitter  and  keen.     Not  Ares'  self — not  Pallas  Athene 
Aught  to  reprove  had  found,  were  her  wrath  inflamed  to  the  utmost. 
Such  and  so  dire  a  work  of  death,  with  men,  and  with  horses      (400) 
Mingled,  had  Zeus  ordained  o'er  Patroclus  dead.     But  Achilles 
Nought  of  the  death  of  his  friend  had  heard  as  yet ;  from  the  vessels 
Far  remote,  beneath  Ilion's  walls  the  battle  was  raging : 
Little  he  ever  supposed  he  would  fall !    Alive  and  victorious 
Looked  he  to  see  him  return  having  reached  the  gates  of  the  city. 
Nor  had  he  thought,  for  a  moment,  that  Troy  would  fall  to  Patroclus. 
Not  for  his  friend ; — no  !  not  for  himself  that  triumph  was  destined. 
This  from  his  mother  he  oft  had  heard,  imparted  in  private. 
So  much  of  Jove's  high  will  to  her  son  she  revealed.     The  misfortune 
Now  befall'n   she   kindly   concealed.     This    grief  she   had    spared 
him;  (4IG) 

Hiding,  with  motherly  care,  the  fate  of  his  dearest  companion. 

Still  round  the  corse  the  battle  raged.  Sharp  spears  were  protended ; 
Heroes  met  heroes  in  ceaseless  charge,  and  slew  one  another; 
While  in  such  words  as  these  each  Greek  his  comrades  encouraged  : 
"  Keep  your  ground,  dear  friends  !  'Twere  shame  to  retreat  and  be- 
take us 
Back  to  our  hollow  ships.  Let  the  dark  earth  yawn  and  engulph  us 
(Rather  than   such   disgrace)  one  and  all.     Such  an  end  would  be 

better 
Than  to  allow  these  Trojans  to  gain  their  point  and  to  drag  him 
Into  their  city  walls,  and  secure  the  prize  and  the  glory."        (419) 
Then  might  the  Trojans  too  have  been  heard,  exhorting  each  other: 
" Friends!     Though  we   all   should   be  stretched  beside  yon  corse 
that  we  fight  for, 


384  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Stand  to  your  arms  I  Fight  on  !  and  let  no  man  think  of  retreating." 
Such  were  the  words  of  both.     Thus  each  encouraged  the  other. 
So  continued  the  fight,  and  the  steely  clash  of  their  weapons 
Up  to  the  brazen  arch  of  heav'n  was  borne  by  the  breezes. 

Standing  aloof  from  the  fight,  with  their  car,  the  steeds  of  Achilles 
Wept,   when    they   heard    the   fall   of    the   chief  whose   hand   had 

controlled  them, 
Prostrate  stretched  in  the  dust  by  the  spear  of  death-dealing  Hector. 
Nor,  though  Automedon  brave,  the  noble  son  of  Diores, 
Plied,  as  a  last  resource,  the  biting  lash  to  excite  them,  (430) 

(First    having    tried    them   with   soothing   words,   then   threats   and 

reproaches,) 
Unto  the  Hellespont  wide  would  they  shape  their  course  and  the 

vessels ; 
Nor  with  the  Grecian  array  would  mix,  and  join  in  the  battle. 
But,  as  above  some  tomb,  the  fixed  memorial  column, 
Marks  where  a  hero's  remains  or  a  noble  dame's  are  reposing, 
Motionless  thus  they  stood,  before  that  beauteous  chariot, 
Drooping  low  to  the  ground  their  heads ;  while  warm  from  their  eyelids 
Rolled  on  the  earth  their  tears;  for  they  grieved  for  the  chief  who 

had  loved  them, 
And  whom  they   loved.     Their   luxuriant   manes   flowed   loose   and 

dishevelled, 
Down  from  their  collars  on  either  side,  all  soiled,  and  entangled.  (440) 
Zeus,  looking  down  from  above,  their  grief  beheld,  and  in  pity 
Sadly  his  head  he  shook,  and  thus  communed  with  his  spirit : 
"Hapless  pair!  Ah!  why  to  a  mortal  prince  did  we  give  you? 
Was  it  for  nought  but  to  bear  your  part,  unchanging,  immortal, 
In  the  long  ceaseless  round  of  human  toil  and  misfortune  ? 
Surely  of  creatures  that  breathe,  and  crawl  upon  earth  in  their  mis'ry, 
Man,  the  most  wretched  of  all,  drags  on  the  saddest  existence ! 
Hector  however,  in  yonder  rich-wrought  car  shall  ye  never 
Bear,  as  your  master  and  lord,  in  his  triumph.    That  I  permit  not. 
Is't  not  enough  that  he  wears  those  spoils  and  boasts  of  his  vict'ry  ? 
Therefore  I  grant  you  strength  of  limb  and  freshness  of  spirit,     (351) 
So  shall  ye  bear  your  driver  Automedon  safe  from  the  battle, 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  385 

Back  to  the  hollow  ships  :  for  yet  must  I  give  to  the  Trojans 
Glory,  and  poufr  to  slay,  till  they  reach  the  ships,  and  in  darkness 
Sunk  be  the  sun,  and  the  sacred  night  shall  have  covered  the  slaughter." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  coursers  inspired  with  fleetness  and  vigour. 
They,  from  their  manes  at  once  shaking  off  the  dust  that  defiled  them, 
Swiftly  bore  off  the  car  through  the  midst  of  the  Trojans  and  Argives. 
While  from  its  seat,  Automedon,  mourning  the  fate  of  his  comrade, 
Scattered  the  Trojan  foes  like  geese  that  fly  from  the  vulture,       (460) 
Easily  forced  they  their  way  through  the  tumult  and  rout  of  the  Trojans, 
Easily  then  returned  to  the  charge,  and  dashed  in  among  them. 
Pow'rless  to  slay,  though  he  chased  them  far  and  wide  :  for  unaided, 
Standing  alone  in  that  proud  car,  one  warrior  sufficed  not, 
Both  with  the  jav'lin  to  fight,  and  to  guide  the  reins  of  the  coursers. 
Him  when  Alcimedon,  son  of  Laerces,  grandson  of  ^Eraon, 
One  of  the  friends  he  loved,  beheld  thus  wildly  careering, 
Thus,  as  the  chariot  passed,  he  shouted  aloud  and  addressed  him : 
"  Which,  O  Automedon  !  which  of  the  gods  deprives  thee  of  reason, 
Urging  thee  on  to  vain  attempts  and  bootless  exertion  ?  (47°) 

How  canst  thou  fight  alone  from  the  car  in  the  front  of  the  battle  ? 
Think,  for  a  moment!    Thy  chief  lies  slain,  and  insolent  Hector 
Vaunts  his  conquest,  and  bears  on  his  shoulders  the  arms  of  Achilles." 
Thus  then  replied  in  turn  Automedon,  son  of  Diores  : 
"None  of  the  Greeks,  O  my  friend  !  is  half  so  able  as  thou  art 
These  fierce  steeds  of  immortal  strain  to  control,  or  to  guide  them, 
Saving  Patroclus,  to  whom  the  gods  that  gift  had  imparted, 
Long  as  he  lived.    Now  vain  his  skill:  for  death  has  o'erta'en  him. 
Mount  then,  thyself,   and   the   scourge   and   embroidered    reins   of 

the  coursers 
Take  from  my  hands,  while  I  dismount  and  join  in  the  battle  !"  (480) 
Thus  he  spake.    Then  Alcimedon  sprang  to  the  car  and  expertly 
Handled  the  reins,  and  guided  the  steeds  with  the  skill  of  a  master. 
Down  leap'd  Automedon.     Him  perceiving,  illustrious  Hector, 
Called  to  JEneas,  who  near  him  stood,  and  thus  he  addressed  him  : 
"Leader  sage  of  the  bronze-mailed  Trojans!  glorious  ^Eneas ! 
See'st  thou  not  there  the  steeds  of  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles, 
Wildly  careering,  guided  by  hands  unfit  to  control  them? 


386  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

These,  if  thou  lend  thine  aid,  and  wilt  heartily  join  to  support  me, 
Easily  might  we  secure  :  for  scarce  will  they  dare  to  resist  us,      (489) 
When  they  behold  us  advancing  at  once,  and  rushing  upon  them." 
Thus  he  spake:  and  the  son  of  Anchises  readily  joined  him; 
Onward  they  rushed,  huge  bulls'-hide  shields  uplifting  before  them, 
Solid,  and  stiff,  with  plates  of  brass  o'erlaid  and  protected. 
Chromius  too  came  on,  and  the  godlike  form  of  Aretus, 
Joined  the  attack,  expecting  to  slay  them  with  ease,  and  the  chariot 
Seize,  and  the  steeds,  high  tossing  their  floating  manes  on  the  breezes: 
Fools  that  they  were  !  not  destined  Automedon's  force  to  encounter, 
And  to  escape  unscathed !     He,  profiting  to  Zeus  his  petition, 
Felt  in  the  depths  of  his  gloomy  soul  fresh  strength  and  assurance ; 
And  to  Alcimedon  thus  he  spake,  his  trusty  companion :  (5°°) 

"Hold  not  the  horses,  Alcimedon  !  far  aloof;  but  behind  me, 
Close,   let    them   stand,   that   their   breath  on  my  back  may  play : 

for  approaching, 
Hector  the  son  of  Priam  I  see,  who  ne'er  fro?n  his  purpose 
Swerves,  and  will  never  desist  till  we  both  are  slain,  and  the  chariot 
Mounting,  he   guides   the   long-maned   steeds,   and   scours   through 

the  battle, 
Putting  the  Greeks  to  flight :  or  himself  shall  be  slain  in  the  contest." 
Thus  having  said,  Menelaiis  he  called  to  his  aid  and  th'  Aiantes : 
"Brave  Menelaiis!  noble  Aiantes!  best  of  the  Argives, 
Leave  ye  the  corse  awhile,  there  are  valiant  chiefs  who  will  guard  it, 
Keeping  the  ground  around  it,  and  driving  away  their  assailants,  (510) 
Come  to  the  aid  of  the  living :  avert  the  fate  that  awaits  us. 
Hither  come  Hector,  JEneas,  and  all  the  first  of  the  Trojans, 
Bursting  upon  us,  forcing  their  way,  through  the  thick  of  the  combat. 
Yet  be  it  so !     To  the  Gods  belong  the  fortunes  of  battle. 
Guide  then  my  spear,  Almighty  Zeus  !     To  thy  will  I  commend  it." 
Ending,  he  hurled  with  a  sweep  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin, 
Which  on  the  smooth  round  orb  of  Aretus'  buckler  alighting, 
All  unimpeded  forced  its  way,  and  the  point  of  the  weapon 
Pierced  through  the  shield  and  the  belt,  and  fixed  itself  in  his  entrails ; 
Then,  as  behind  the  horns  of  some  mighty  bull  in  the  shambles  (520) 
Falls  the  sharp  axe,  impelled  by  the  brawny  arm  of  the  butcher, 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  387 

Cutting  the  tendons — forward  he  springs,  and  sinks  in  his  death-pang: 
So  springing  forward,  Aretus  fell.     Deep  rooted  and  quiv'ring, 
Plunged  in  his  entrails  stood  the  spear,  and  cut  short  his  existence. 
Hector  then  at  Automedon  aimed,  but  the  glittering  weapon 
Marked,  as  it  flew,  the  chief,  and  forward  bent,  and  the  jav'lin 
Passed  o'er  his  head,  and  deep  in  the  soil  stood  rooted  behind  him. 
Trembling   it  stood,  for  the  shaft  still   shook  with  the   might   that 

impelled  it; 
Quiv'ring  from  butt  to  point  through  its  length,    till  its  force  was 

exhausted. 
Drawing    their    swords,    now    rushed    they    together    in    desperate 

conflia;  (530) 

When  interposing  th'  Aiantes  arrived,  who,  from  far,  through   the 

tumult, 
Forcing  their  way,  had  come  to  his  aid,  at  the  call  of  their  comrade. 
Them,  when  those  three  beheld,  great  Hector,  ^Eneas,  and  Chromius, 
Back  they  retreated  at  once  in  haste,  not  daring  to  face  them, 
Leaving  Aretus  pierced  through  the  heart,  on  the  ground  undefended. 
Him  then  Automedon  stripped,  and  despoiled  his  glittering  armour, 
And  with  a  loud  exulting  shout,  thus  vaunted  his  conquest : 
"This  for  Patroclus  slain,  shall  afford  some  poor  consolation, 
Though  but  a  chief  of  inferior  note  hath  fall'n  to  my  prowess." 
Thus,  having   spoken,   and   placing  the  blood-stained  spoils  in  the 

chariot,  (54°) 

Up  he  sprang,  with  his  feet  all  splashed  with  blood,  and  his  fingers 
Reeking — as  quits  some  lion  the  mangled  remains  of  a  heifer. 

Once  more  around  Patroclus  the  chiefs  in  desperate  conflict 
Fierce,  unrelenting,  closed.     And  Athene  now,  from  Olympus 
Hastening,  stirred  it  to  tenfold  rage.     She,  sent  by  the  Thund'rer, 
Now,  that  his  mind  was  changed,  the  Greeks  encouraged  and  aided. 
And  as  when  Zeus,  in  the  clouds  his  purple  bow  unto  mortals 
Holds  forth  on  high,  for  a  sign  of  approaching  war,  or  a  warning 
Sure,  of  the  coming  storm,  when  man  must  cease  from  his  labours, 
Helpless,  and  mourn   o'er   the  waste  of  his   ruined   crops,  and   his 

cattle :  (550) 

Thus  did  the  Goddess,  shrouded  in  purple  mist,  with  the  Grecians 


25- 


388  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Mix,  and  excite  their  host,  and  arouse  each  heart  for  the  combat. 
Atreus'  son  she  first  addressed,  the  brave  Menelaiis, 
Close  to  his  side  approaching,  and  thus  she  awakened  his  courage, 
Taking  the  aged  form,  and  resounding  accents  of  Phoenix : 
"Endless  shame,  and  deserved  disgrace  will  be  thine,  Menelaiis, 
If  thou  shalt  suffer  the  Trojan  dogs,  at  the  wall  of  their  city, 
Noble  Achilles'  faithful  friend  and  companion  to  mangle : 
Therefore  be  bold,  renew  the  fight,  and  rouse  up  thy  warriors." 
Then  Menelaiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle,  responded :  (560) 

"  Father  Phoenix ;   old  and  revered,  what  more  can  I  wish  for, 
(Would  but  Athene'  grant  me  strength,  and  ward  off  their  weapons,) 
Than  to  stand  stoutly  in  arms,  and  defend  the  remains  of  Patroclus. 
None  with  a  deeper  grief  beheld  him  perish.     But  He 61  or 
Rages  with  fiery  force,  and  with  ceaseless  fury  his  jav'lin 
Wields ;  and  the  mighty  hand  of  Zeus  is  outstretched  to  exalt  him." 

Pleased  to  be  first  invoked  of  all  the  blessed  immortals, 
Blue-eyed  Athene  heard  and  approved  his  words ;  and  with  vigour 
Filled  him,  and  strength  infused  into  all  his  limbs,  and  his  shoulders. 
Courage   she   gave  him,  like  that   of  the  venomous  fly,  which  per- 
sisting, (570) 
Ever  renews  its  sharp  attacks  though  repelled;  and  rejoicing, 
Pierces  the  flesh  of  man,  and  drains  the  sweet  blood  of  his  victim. 
Such  was  the  angry  and  vengeful  spirit  she  roused  in  his  bosom, 
As  o'er  Patroclus  standing,  his  gleaming  weapon  he  brandished, 

Podes,  Eetion's  son,  was  among  the  first  of  the  Trojans, 
Valiant,  noble,  and  rich;  belov'd  and  respected  by  Hector, 
Far  o'er  the  rest :  at  the  genial  board  his  frequent  companion. 
Him,  as  he  turned  him  to  shun  the  coming  foe,  Menelaus, 
Pierced  through  the  belt  with  his  lance,  and  the  point  passed  straight 

through  his  body. 
Down  with  a  crash  he  fell :  and  from  out  the  host  of  his  comrades  (580) 
Dragged  Menelaus  the  dead  within  the  lines  of  the  Grecians. 
Forthwith  Apollo,  Hector  approaching,  roused  him  to  vengeance: 
Phaenops,  Asias'  son,  he  seemed,  who  in  distant  Abydos 
Dwelt,  and  as  Hector's  favoured  guest  was  honoured  and  welcomed. 
Such  was  the  shape  by  Phoebus  assumed,  when  thus  he  addressed  him ; 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  389 

"Which  of  the  Greeks  henceforth  will  dread  the  prowess  of  Hector, 
Who  but  to  meet   Menelaus  fears?     A  redoubtable  warrior 
Never  accounted:  yet  now  hath  he  slain  thy  trusted  companion, 
Podes  the  brave,  Eetion's  son,  in  the  front  of  the  battle, 
And  by  his  single  might  now  drags  the  corse  from  amongst  us."  (590) 

Thus  as  he  spake,  deep  grief  o'erclouded  the  spirit  of  Hector, 
Sheathed  in  refulgent  bronze,  he  rushed  at  once  to  the  vanguard. 
Then  around  Ida's  peaks  collected  the  clouds;  and  Kronion, 
Rearing  aloft  his  ^Egis  fring'd  and  bright,  through  the  darkness 
Flashed   forth   his    lightning.     Loud   the   thunder  roared,   and  the 

mountain 
Shook :  to  the  Trojans  a  signal  of  triumph — woe  to  the  Argives. 
Pe'neleus  first,  the  Boeotian  chief,  was  smitten  with  panic; 
Ever,  till  then,  had  he  faced  his  foes ;  but  now  on  the  shoulder, 
Wounded,  though  not  to  death,  he  fled.     Polydamus'  jav'lin 
Singling  him  out  from  afar  had  grazed  the  bone  in  its  passage.      (600) 
Leitus,  mighty  Alectryon's  son,  by  the  jav'lin  of  Hector 
Struck  through  the  wrist,  retired  from  the  fight  disabled  and  trembling 
When  he  beheld  the  warriors  of  Troia  closing  around  him, 
All  unable  himself  to  grasp  his  spear  and  oppose  them. 
Hector  rushed  on  in  pursuit :  but  Idomeneus  full  on  his  corslet 
Smote,  with  his  long-protended  spear.     O'er  the  pap  it  alighted, 
There  broke  short,  nor  pierced  that  armour  of  proof ;  but  the  Trojans 
Shouted  aloud.     Him  Hector  in  turn  attacked,  in  his  chariot, 
Proudly  erecl  as  he  stood,  and  the  sharp  spear  narrowly  missed  him; 
Cceranus,  Merion's  charioteer,  it  struck,  his  attendant,  (610) 

Who  from  fair  Lyctos,  his  native  town,  had  followed  his  master. 
(Merion  on  foot  from  his  shapely  ships  had  gone  forth  to  battle 
And  by  his  fall  that  day  would  have  swelled  the  glory  of  Hector, 
But  that  with  thoughtful  care  in  his  chariot  Cceranus  followed, 
Warding  the  evil  hour,  and  providing  the  means  of  escaping; 
Destined  himself  to  fall  by  the  death-dealing  spear  of  the  victor.) 
Him  through  the  jaws  he  smote,  beneath  the  ear,  and  the  weapon, 
Cleaving  his  tongue,  forced  out  his  teeth,  and  he  dropped  from  the 

chariot 
Prone  in  the  dust.    His  fingers  relaxed  and  the  reins  they  abandoned. 


390  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Merion  stooped  and  snatched  them  up  from  the  ground, — to   the 
chariot  (620) 

Springing  in  haste,  and  loudly  thus  to  Idomeneus  shouted: 
"  Spare  not  the  scourge,  but  make,  with  all  thy  speed,  for  the  vessels, 
Victory  now,  thyself  must  see,  forsakes  the  Achaians." 
Thus  he  spake.     Idomeneus  heard,  and  lashed  on  his  horses, 
Off  for  the  ships,  in  full  career;  for  panic  had  seized  him. 

Now  nor  the  lofty  spirit  of  Aias,  nor  brave  Menelaiis, 
Failed  to  perceive  that  Zeus  had  decreed  success  to  the  Trojans. 
Thus  then,  in  words  of  despair  broke  forth  Telamonian  Aias : 
"  Gods !  What  an  hour  for  Greece  /    Now  a  fool  may  see  that   the 

Trojans, 
Favoured  by  Zeus,  in  this  day's  fight  are  destined  to  triumph.      (630) 
Every  spear  they  throw  strikes  home,  no  matter  who  hurls  it, 
Coward  or  valiant  chief.     Zeus  speeds  it  straight  to  its  object, 
While  from  our  hands  each  dart  falls  short,  unwounding  and  harmless. 
Now  must  we  well  bethink  us,  if  haply  forth  from  the  struggle 
Yet  we  may  draw  the  dead,  and  ourselves  retiring  in  safety 
Glad  the  hearts   of  our   comrades   and   friends,  who   with   anxious 

foreboding 
Wait  the  result,  looking  on;  and  hardly  expect  our  deliv'rance 
From  the  destroying  hands  and  the  might  of  death-dealing  Hector, 
And  at  the  best  but  hope  at  our  shelt'ring  ships  to  behold  us. 
Would  that  some  chief  could  be  found  this  news  to  bear  to  Peleides. 
Hardly,  methinks,  the  mournful  tidings  yet  can  have  reached  him.  (641) 
Scarce  can  he  yet  have  learned  the  fate  of  his  friend  and  companion. 
Darkness  however  is  all  around;  nor  my  sight  can  distinguish 
One  to  dispatch:  o'er  horse  and  man  so  deep  is  the  shadow. 
Father  Zeus !     Lift  off  this  cloud  from  the  sons  of  Achaia ! 
Give  us  to  see  with  our  eyes — let  the  sky  look  down  on  our  efforts ! 
If  'tis  thy  will  we  die,  in  the  light  of  day  let  us  perish." 

Weepi?ig  he  spake :  and  the  Father  beheld  his  tears  with  compassion, 
And  on  the  instant  cleft  the  cloud  and  scattered  the  darkness. 
Forth  broke  the  sun  at  once,  and  displayed  the  scene  of  the  combat. 
Thus  then  Aias  addressed  the  warlike  Prince,  Menelaiis:         (651) 
"Cast  thine  eyes,  Menelaus,  around;  and  try  to  discover 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  391 

Valiant  Antilochus,  Nestor's  son,  if  he  yet  be  surviving; 
Bid  him  repair  at  his  utmost  speed  to  Achilles,  and  tell  him 
This  sad  news — the  death  of  his  best-loved  friend  and  companion." 
Thus  he  spake.    Menelaus  complied,  and  set  forth  on  his  errand. 
Forth  he  went,  as  retreats  some  lion,  who  jaded  and  weary, 
Quits   with   the    dawn    of  day  the   fold,   where    the    dogs    and   the 

herdsmen 
All  night  long  he  has  kept  in  alarm,  in  defence  of  their  cattle, 
SurT'ring  him  not  to  approach  their  charge,  though  maddened  with 

hunger  (660) 

Oft  he  attempts  it,  but  spears  and  shafts  come  show'ring  upon  him, 
Darted  by  rude  and  sturdy  hands ;  and  the  blaze  of  the  torches, 
Which  above  all  he  dreads,  and  the  brands,  bewilder  and  scare  him. 
Baffled  and  surly  he  yields  at  length,  and  retreats  to  the  thicket. 
Thus  from  Patroclus'  corse,  reluctant,  brave  Menelaus 
Sadly  withdrew  :  for  much  he  feared  that  perchance  the  Achaians, 
Seized  with  a  panic  fear,  might  leave  it  a  prize  to  their  foemen. 
Merion  and  both  Aiantes  he  thus  exhorted  at  parting : 
"Merion  !  and  you,  Aiantes ;  ye  valiant  chiefs  of  the  Argives  ! 
Think,  oh !  think,  how  gentle  and  kind,  how  mild  in  his  bearing, 
Ever,  to  all,  while  he  lived,  was  our  friend,  the  hapless  Patroclus.  (671) 
Living,    you    loved    him.      Defend   his    remains,    now    death    hath 

o'erta'en  him." 
Thus  having  spoken,  departed  the  fair-hair'd  chief  Menelaus, 
Looking  around  as  he  went  with  the  piercing  glance  which  an  eagle, 
Keenest  sighted  of  birds  that  wing  th'  expanse  of  the  aether, 
Darts  from  her  airy  height  on  the  hare  that  fain  would  conceal  him 
Under  the  thicket's  shade  :  in  vain ;  for,  pouncing  upon  him, 
Swift,  with  a  deadly  swoop,  she  bears  him  aloft  in  her  talons. 
Thus,  Menelaus,  thy  keen  bright  eyes  ranged  wide  through  the  armies, 
Scanning  with  care  each  friendly  band,  in  hope  to  discover  (680) 

Valiant  Antilochus,  Nestor's  son,  surviving  the  slaughter. 
Him  on  the  left  of  the  field  he  soon  perceived,  in  the  combat, 
Cheering  his  warriors  on  to  fight:  and,  closely  approaching, 
Thus  did  the  fair-hair'd  chief  Menelaus  deliver  his  message : 
"Hither!  Antilochus,  cherished  of  Zeus!  and  list  to  my  tidings — 


392  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Tidings  of  woe : — alas  !  that  e'er  I  should  have  to  report  them. 
Surely  thyself,  methinks,  and  all,  must  perceive  and  acknowledge 
Some  more  than  mortal  pow'r  which  heaps  such  woes  on  the  Argives, 
Victory  granting  to  Troy.    He  is  fall'n !  our  bravest  Achaian. 
Mighty  Patroclus  is  dead!  to  the  grief  and  despair  of  the  Grecians.  (690) 
Run,  my  friend,  to  the  ships,  and  the  tidings  bear  to  Achilles, 
Who,  if  he  haste,  may  yet  preserve  the  corse  of  his  comrade, 
Naked  and  stript  as  it  lies :  for  his  arms  are  the  trophies  of  Hector." 

Thus  he  spake.    But  Antilochus,  horror-struck  for  a  long  time, 
Stood,  when  he  heard,  nor  a  word  could  speak,  while  under  his  eyelids 
Gathered  the  blindi?ig  tears,  and  his  voice  was  choked  in  its  utt'rance. 
Yet  he  neglected  not  Menelaiis'  command,  but  departed, 
Running  with  speed,  and  his  arms  to  Laodocus  gave,  his  attendant, 
Valiant  and  faithful,  who  waited  near  with  his  chariot  and  horses. 
Weeping  he  left  the  field,  and  shaped  his  course  to  Achilles,        (700) 
Dreading  to  think  of  his  grief  at  the  mournful  news  he  must  tell  him. 
Then,  Menelaiis  divine  !  thy  thoughts  returned  to  Patroclus, 
Nor  wouldst  thou  linger  there  to  aid  the  Pylian  warriors, 
Sore  bested,  and  murm'ring,  albeit,  at  their  leader's  departure. 
These  to  command  Thrasymedes  bold  he  deputed,  and  hastened 
Back  to  his  post  once  more,  to  protect  the  remains  of  the  hero. 
Quickly  he  reached  th'  Aiantes  again,  and  thus  he  addressed  them : 
"  On  to  the  hollow  ships  yon  chief  have  I  sent,  as  thou  bad'st  me, 
Bearing  sad  tidings  of  war,  to  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles: 
Not  that  I  think  he  will  come,  though  burning  with  rage  against 
Hector,  (7IQ) 

How  can  he  leave  his  tent  unarmed  to  fight  with  the  Trojans? 
Now  then  the  time  is  come,  for  a  last  and  desperate  effort, 
Now  from  the  press  must  we  tear  the  corse  away,  and  bethink  us 
How  to  escape,  ourselves,  with  life  from  the  rage  of  the  Trojans." 

Thus  he  spake ;   and  thus  replied  Telamonian  Aias  : 
"  Wise  are  thy  words,  and  true,  most  noble  Prince,  Menelaiis  ! 
Come  then  !     Do  thou  thyself,  and  Meriones,  lift  up  the  body, 
Placing  yourselves  beneath  it,  and  bear  it  off: — while  behind  you, 
We  two,  alike  in  name,  alike  in  valour  and  prowess, 
Used  to  support  each  other,  in  many  a  desperate  conflict,      (720) 


Book  XVII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  393 

Beat  off  the  foe,  and  secure  your  retreat  from  the  Trojans  and  Hector." 
Thus  he  spake ;  and  the  chiefs,  with  united  exertion  upheaving, 
Raised  in  their  arms  the  corse,  and  bore  it  off :  while  the  Trojans 
Sent  forth  a  yell  of  despite  and  rage,  when  they  saw  them  retiring. 
On  they  rushed,  like  dogs  which  far  in  advance  of  the  hunters 
Fly  in  a  pack  on  a  wounded  boar  retreating  before  them. 
On,  in  full  cry,  they  come,  all  eager  and  longing  to  tear  him, 
Till,  on  his  strength  relying,  he  turns  to  face  his  pursuers; 
Back  they  recoil,  and  scatter  in  wild  dismay  and  confusion. 
Thus  came  the  Trojans  on,  still  following  them  up  in  a  body,        (730) 
Hacking  with  swords,  and  thrusting  with  two-edg'd  lances  behind 

them. 
But  when  th'Aiantes  faced  about,  and  stood  to  oppose  them, 
Pale  with  fear  they  became,  nor  had  one  the  face,  or  the  daring, 
Forward  to  press,  lay  ha?ids  on  the  corse,  or  fight  for  its  capture. 
Thus  from  the  fight,  with  all  the  strength  and  speed  they  could  summon, 
Bore  they  the  dead  away  to  the  hollow  ships,  and  behind  them 
Raged  the  war,  like  a  fire  which,  seizing  some  populous  city, 
Suddenly  blazes  forth :    down  sink  the  houses,  and  dwindle 
In  the  devouring  glare,  and  a  whirlwind  roars  through  the  ruins. 
Thus,  as  they  went,  an  incessant  rattle  of  horses  and  chariots  (740) 
Followed  them  up,  with  the  clash  of  arms,  and  shouting  of  warriors ; 
And  as  when  mules,  who  put  forth  their  strength  to  the  work,  with 

exertion, 
Drag  some  enormous  beam  down  a  rugged  path  in  the  mountains, 
Some  huge  mast  for  a  ship ;  with  the  strain  and  wearisome  labour 
Pours  down  the  sweat  from  their  toilworn  limbs ;  yet  slack  not  their 

efforts : 
Thus  with  determined  spirit  they  bore  the  corse :  and  th'  Aiantes 
Flung  themselves  on  the  foe.     As  some  wood-clothed  mound,  which 

projecting, 
Far  on  the  plain,  like  a  dam,  diverts  the  rush  of  the  waters, 
Stemming  the  headlong  course  of  the  mountain  streams  and  the  torrents; 
Dashing  them  off  to  some  distant  vale,  while  to  break  its  resist- 
ance, (750) 
All  unavailing,  they  pour,  with  ceaseless  rage,  on  the  barrier : 


394  1HE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVII. 

Thus  did  th'  Aiantes  twain  hurl  back  the  assaults  of  the  Trojans. 
Yet  came  they  on,  and  renewed  the  charge,  two  heroes  among  them 
Leading:  ^Eneas,  Anchises'  son,  and  magnanimous  Hector. 
And,  as  a  cloud  of  starlings  or  daws,  with  shrieking  and  clamour 
Fly  for  their  lives,  when  they  see  the  hawk  come  pouncing  upon  them, 
(Deadly  foe  of  each  smaller  bird,  who  dreads  a?id  avoids  him), 
So  fled  the  sons  of  Achaia  before  ^Eneas  and  Hector. 
Shrieking  they  fled,  in  clamorous  rout;   their  prowess  forgotten. 
In  and  around  the  trench  lay  thick  their  spoils,  and  the  armour,  (760) 
Costly  and  rich,  of  the  flying  Greeks :  yet  ceased  not  the  battle.

Argument. 

Achilles  receives  the  news  of  the  death  of  Patroclus.  His  grief 
Thetis  comes  to  comfort  him  and  promises  to  procure  for  him  new  armour 
from  Hephaestus.  Hera  sends  Iris  to  Achilles,  bidding  him  shew  himself 
unarmed  at  the  trench.  A  t  sight  of  him  the  Trojans  retire,  panic-struck, 
and  the  body  of  Patroclus  is  brought  to  his  tent.  Night  coming  on,  the 
Trojans  call  a  council.  Polydamas  advises  their  retreat  within  the  walls 
of  Troy.  Heclor  refuses,  and  they  remain  encamped.  The  body  of 
Patroclus  is  prepared  for  sepulture,  and  Achilles  watches  it.  Thetis 
repairs  to  the  palace  of  Hephaestus,  who  at  her  prayer  prepares  for  Achilles 
a  new  suit  of  armour.  Description  of  it  and  especially  that  of  the  shield. 
Before  daybreak  it  is  completed,  and  Thetis  carries  it  to  the  tent  of 
Achilles,

n^HUS,  like  the  blaze  of  devouring  fire  continued  the  combat, 
•^    While  to  Achilles  Antilochus  swiftly  sped  with  his  message. 
Watchful  he  found  him,  in  front  of  the  lofty  prows  of  his  vessels, 
Filled  with  foreboding  of  ills,  alas  !    already  accomplished. 
Sore  disturbed,  such  thoughts  as  these  he  revolved  in  his  bosom: 

"  What  do  I  see  ?    Why  hurry  the  crested  Greeks  to  their  vessels, 
Thus  in  disordered  rout  ?    Why  quit  they  the  field  in  confusion  ? 
Has  then,  at  length,  that  threaten'd,  that  worst  misfortune  befall'n  me, 
Long  foretold  by  my  mother  in  words  of  ominous  warning, 
When  she  declared  that  the  bravest  of  all  my  Myrmidon  warriors   (10) 
Here  before  Troy  should  fall,  and  I  remain  to  lament  him  ? 
Has  then  the  valiant  son  of  great  Mencetius  perished  ? 
Rash  that  he  was  !     I  bade  him  return,  from  the  fires  of  the  Trojans 
First  having  saved  the  ships,  and  avoid  the  encounter  of  Hector." 

Thus  while  he  stood  with  his  prescient  soul  communing  and  anxious, 
Close  approaching  arrived  the  son  of  illustrious  Nestor, 
Tears  flowing  warm  from  his  eyes;  and  thus  the  sad  news  he  delivered : 
"  Grievous,  alas  !  are  the  tidings  I  bear,  great  Peleus'  offspring ! 
Which  thou  must  hear :  and  woe  is  me  !  who  am  here  to  announce 

them. 
Dead  is  Patroclus.     Around  his  corse  the  battle  is  raging.         (20) 
Naked  he  lies,  and  crest-waving  Hector  possesses  his  armour." 

Thus  as  he  spake,  dark  sank  the  shadow  of  grief  on  Achilles. 
Grasping  with  both  his  hands  the  scorching  dust  of  the  embers, 
Thick  on  his  head  he  heaped  it,  defiling  his  beauteous  features. 


398  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

Black  fell  the  mournful  stain  on  his  rich  ambrosial  mantle. 
Dashed  on  the  ground,  his  tow'ring  form  in  the  dust  lay  extended 
Grov'ling,  — his  hair  from  the  roots  he  tore  and  scattered  by  handfuls. 
Forth  from  the  tent  came  running  the  handmaids  all,  whom  Achilles 
Won,  and  Patroclus,  in  war ;  and  shrieking  with  grief  and  with  horror, 
Gathered  around  the  prostrate  prince  :  some  fainted,  and  others    (30) 
Mourning,  and  drowned  in  tears,  stood  beating  their  beauteous  bosoms. 
Down  by  his  side  Antilochus  knelt,  all  bitterly  weeping, 
Holding  his  arms,  yet  groaning  with  anguish  the  while,  for  he  dreaded 
Lest,  in  his  grief  and  despair  he  should  seek  some  means  of  destruction : 
Then  in  loud  sobs  and  moans  his  grief  broke  forth.     And  his  mother 
Heard  him  afar,  in  the  depths  of  the  sea,  where  she  sate  with  her 

father, 
Ancient  of  days  :  and  she  too  moaned — while,  assembled  around  her, 
All  the  young  Nereids,  who  dwell  in  the  green  recesses  of  ocean, 
Came  at  her  cries.     Thaleia  the  fair,  Cymodoce,  Glauce, 
Halia  with  large  resple?ident  eyes,  Nersea  and  Speio,  (40) 

Thoe,  Cymothoe  too,  and  Actasa,  and  Lymnorsea, 
Melita  fair,  and  Isera,  Amphithoe  bright,  and  Agave 
There  too  assembled  Doto,  Pherusa,  Dynamene',  Proto, 
Thither  Amphinome  came,  Dexamene,  Callianeira, 
Doris,  Nemertes,  and  she  who  outshone  them  all,  Galatea, 
Panope  sleek,  and  truthful  Apseudes,  Callianassa, 
Clymene  graceful,  dark  Ianira,  fair  Ianassa, 
Soft  Amathaea  with  waving  locks,  Orithuia  and  Maera. 
Gathered  each  Nereid  about  their  Queen,  in  her  cave  of  the  ocean, 
Filling  the  silvery-gleaming  grot :   each  beating  her  bosom,         (50) 
Bearing  a  part  in  Thetis'  woe,  while  thus  she  lamented : 
"Listen,  ye  sister  Nereids  all!   Give  ear  to  my  sorrows, 
So  shall  ye  learn,  how  sad  my  state,  how  deep  is  my  anguish. 
Wretched  mother !  ill-fated  son  !  though  the  bravest  of  mortals. 
Why  did  I  bear  thee  ?     Stainless  of  soul !     unconquered  in  battle  ! 
Noblest  of  heroes  !     As  some  fair  tree  shoots  up  from  a  sapling, 
Planted  in  fertile  soil,  in  grace  he  grew  and  in  vigour. 
Grown  up  to  man's  estate,  in  his  ships  to  Ilion  I  sent  him, 
There  with  the  Trojans  to  fight.     Ah !  never  again  to  revisit 


Book  XVIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  399 

Home,  or  reenter  the  ancient  halls  of  Peleus  his  father.  (60) 

Still  with  corroding  grief  are  his  days  consumed,  and  in  sorrow 
Passes  his  life  away  :    nor  can  I  do  aught  to  assist  him. 
Yet  will  I  go.     I  shall  see  my  son ;  and  at  least  he  will  tell  me, 
Since  from  the  war  he  retired,  what  fresh  distress  hath  o'erta'en  him." 

Thus  giving  way  to  her  grief,  she  left  the  cave  :  and  the  Nereids 
Followed  in  tears.     And  they  cleft  the  briny  wave ;  and  the  ocean 
Opened ;   and  soon  they  beheld  the  fertile  region  of  Troia. 
Soon  they  ascended  the  beach  in  long  array,  where  Achilles 
Camped,  and  the  ships  on  the  strand  were  moored  of  the  Myrmidon 

warriors. 
Groaning  with  anguish  Achilles  lay,  and  his  mother  approaching    (70) 
Uttered  a  piteous  cry,  as,  raising  his  head  she  caressed  it. 
Then  in  compassionate  words  of  heartfelt  grief  she  addressed  him : 
"  Why  dost  thou  weep,  my  son  ?     What  grief  hath  fall'n  on  thy  spirit  ? 
Tell  me.     Conceal  it  not.     Now  Zeus  hath  fulfilled  thy  petition, 
All  thy  prayer,  with  uplifted  hands  preferred,  that  the  Grecians, 
Cooped  up  before  their  ships,  to  their  own  resources  abandoned, 
Driv'n  by  defeat  and  disgrace,  at  length  thy  worth  should  acknowledge." 

Deeply  sighing,  responded  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles  : 
"  True,  my  mother  ;  Olympian  Zeus  all  this  hath  accomplished. 
Yet  what  boots  it  to  me,  now  my  friend  is  torn  from  my  bosom,    (80) 
Whom  like  a  second  self  I  loved,  and  beyond  his  companions 
Honoured  ?  Patroclus  is  dead  !  And,  decked  with  his  beauteous  armour, 
He 61  or,  his  murderer,  yet  survives :  those  arms  which  to  Peleus, 
Wondrous  to  view — a  priceless  gift — the  Gods  at  his  marriage 
Gave,  when  immortal  charms  they  consigned  to  a  mortal's  embraces. 
Oh  !  hadst  thou  still  remained  with  thy  sister  nymphs  of  the  ocean, 
Peleus  had  wedded  a  mortal  bride !     Henceforth  in  thy  bosom 
Countless  and  ceaseless  woes  must  dwell  for  the  fate  of  thine  offspring, 
Whom  thou  shalt  never  receive  in  his  home,  returning  in  triumph. 
Now  have  I  no  desire  to  live,  or  in  aught  that  concerns  them        (90) 
Mix  with  my  fellow-men.      Upon  Hector  alone  are  conce?itered 
All  my  thoughts — till  he  pour  forth  his  life,  transfixed  by  my  jav'lin, 
Yielding  me  full  revenge  for  the  slaughter  and  spoil  of  Patroclus." 

Fast  flowed  the  tears  of  Thetis  again,  while  thus  she  responded : 


400  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

"  Short  will  indeed  be  thy  life,  my  son  if  such  be  thy  purpose. 
Hector  dead,  thy  fall  is  at  hand.     Thou  must  follow  him  quickly !" 
Moodily  then  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"  Then  let  me  quickly  perish,  whose  arms  while  living  availed  not 
Death  from  my  friend  to  avert.     There  lies  he,  far  from  his  country 
Slain :    and  when   fate   approached,  he  longed   for   me   to   protecl 

him.  (100) 

Now  I  dismiss  all  thought  of  return  to  the  land  of  my  fathers, 
And  since  thus  I  have  failed  to  preserve  my  friend,  and  the  heroes 
Countless,  who  owe  their  fall  to  the  hands  of  slaughtering  Hector — 
Since,  upon  earth  a  useless  load,  I  sit  by  my  vessels 
Idle;  acknowledged,  albeit,  by  the   bronze-mailed   Greeks  as  their 

bravest 
Ever  in  war  (let  others  excel  as  they  may  in  the  council) — 
Now  and  henceforth,  away  with  dispute,  away  with  contention 
Both  among  gods  and   men,  and   with   wrath   which   maddens  the 

wisest. 
Sweet  as  the  honey-drop  to  the  heart  it  seems;  in  the  bosom 
Rising  like  smoke  it  o'erclouds  the  mind,  bewilders  the  judgment. 
Such  was  the  wrath  I  felt  at  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon.  (T*i) 

Now  from  my  thoughts  I  dismiss  it — a  thing  of  the  past — (though 

he  vexed  me) 
Bending  my  stubborn  soul  to  the  craving  need  which  impels  it. 
Him  who  that  dearest  head  laid  low,  will  I  seek,  and  destroy  him. 
And  if  my  turn  come  next — then  welcome  death,  by  th'  immortals 
Sent,  when  the  fulness  of  time  and  the  will  of  Zeus  shall  demand  me. 
'Tis  not  in  valour  to  ward  off  fate.     The  might  of  Herakles, 
Dear  as  he  was  to  sov'reign  Zeus,  great  offspring  of  Kronos, 
Perished,  o'erthrown  by  Fate,  and  the  vengeful  anger  of  Here. 
So    shall    I   fall.     On   the   field  some  hostile   weapon  shall  stretch 

me  (I2°) 

Lifeless.     Yet  while  I  live  let  me  live  for  vengeance  and  glory. 
Many  a  full-bosomed  Trojan  and  Dardan  dame,  in  her  palace 
Mourning  with  ceaseless  lament  the  death  of  her  sons  or  her  husband, 
Wiping  with  agonized  hands  the  tears  that  roll  down  her  features, 
Soon  shall  know  that  Achilles  but  held  him  aloof  from  the  battle. 


Book  XVIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  401 

Hope  not  then,  with  maternal  fondness,  to  keep  me  from  fighting." 
Thus  then  the  Goddess,  the  snowy-footed  Thetis,  responded : 
"  All  thou  hast  said,  my  son,  is  true.     Nor  indeed  can  I  blame  thee 
Shouldst  thou  go  forth  to  war  in    defence    of  thy  friends   and   thy 
comrades.  (I29) 

Only,  unarmed,  thou  canst  not  fight.     In  the  hand  of  the  Trojans 
All  thy  resplendent  arms  are  detained ;  and  death-dealing  Hector 
Wears  them,  exulting  in  pride.     Not  long,  I  ween,  upon  Hector 
Destined  by  fate  to  shine :  for  destruction  hovers  around  him. 
Wherefore  restrain  thy  rage,  nor  mix  in  the  struggles  of  Ares 
Till  thou  shalt  here  behold  me  again.     To-morrow  at  sunrise 
Hither  expect  my  return.     And  a  noble  suit  will   I  bring  thee, 
Glorious  and  rich,  supplied  by  the  sov'reign  skill  of  Hephaestus." 
Thus  having  spoken,  she  quitted  the  tents  of  her  son,  and  to  sea- 
ward 
Turning,   her   sisters   addressed,   the   old   sea-god's   cave-dwelling 

daughters : 
"  Now  when  ye  plunge  once  more  in  the  wide-heaving  bosom  of  ocean, 
There,  in  his   echoing  grot,  our  hoary  sire  to  revisit,  (I4I) 

All  that  has  past  relate.     Meanwhile,  unto  lofty  Olympus 
Speed  I  my  flight :  there  skilful  Hephaestus  to  seek,  and  persuade  him 
Gorgeous  arms  to  supply,  by  to-morrow's  dawn,  for  Achilles." 
This  when  they  heard,  deep  down  they  plunged,  and  were  lost  in 

the  billows; 
Silvery-footed  Thetis  the  heights  of  Olympus  ascended, 
Eager  to  urge  her  suit,  and  obtain  new  arms  for  her  offspring. 
Thither  she  flew,  at  her  utmost  speed.     Meanwhile  the  Achaians 
Hurried  along  in  tumultuous  flight  before  death-dealing  Hector 
Struck,  from  above,  with  dismay;  and  the  Hellespont  reached,  and 
the  vessels;  i^S°) 

Nor  had  they  yet  secured  their  dead,  nor  the  corse  of  Patroclus 
Out  of  the  reach  of  the  spears  and  darts  conveyed ;  for  the  Trojans 
Followed  it  up,  both  horse  and  man ;  by  the  offspring  of  Priam, 
Hector  the  brave,  led  on,  like  a  flame  impelled  by  the  tempest. 
Thrice,  from  behind,  the  corse  by  the  feet  had  he  seized  as  they 
bore  it,

4o2  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

Tugging  amain,  and  with  eager  shouts  encouraged  the  Trojans  ; 
Thrice  had  th'  Aiantes  twain  collecting  their  strength  to  oppose  him 
Forced  him  away :  yet  still  to  the  charge  he  returned,  to  his  purpose 
Firm;  now  pushing  his  way  through  the  struggling  crowd,  now  de- 
sisting, 
Pausing  awhile  and  shouting  for  aid,  yet  never  retreating.  (l^&gt;°) 

And  as  the  shepherd  swains  in  their  nightly  watch  from  a  carcase 
Strive,  but  in  vain,  to  chase  some  tawny  and  ravenous  lion, 
Thus  unavailing  were  all  th'  Aiantes'  force  and  their  efforts 
Crest-waving  Hector's  assault  to  repress,  and  rescue  the  body. 

Then  had  he  torn  it  away,  immortal  glory  acquiring, 
But  that  from  high  Olympus  in  haste  shot  swift-winged  Iris, 
Calling  on  Peleus'  son  to  arm.     Unknown  to  the  thund'rer 
And  to  the  other  immortal  gods  had  Hera  dispatched  her. 
Close  to  his  side  she  stood,  and  reproachfully  thus  she  addressed  him  : 
"  Rouse  thee  to  action  !  Peleus'  son  !  most  dreaded  of  mortals:  (170) 
Rise,  and  protect  Patroclus,  around  whose  corse  are  contending 
Greeks  and  Trojans  in  desperate  fight  and  slaught'ring  each  other 
There  at  the  ships  :  those  struggling  hard  to  secure  and  protect  it, 
These  to  bear  it  away  to  their  wind-swept  Ilian  city. 
There  in  full  force  are  the  Trojans,  and  there  illustrious  Hector, 
Chief  of  them  all,  strains  ev'ry  nerve, — its  head  from  the  body 
Meaning  to  sever,  and  fix  it  aloft  on  a  pole  for  a  trophy. 
Up  then  !  linger  no  more.     Thy  soul  should  revolt  at  permitting 
Him,  thy  Patroclus,  a  sport  to  become  for  the  dogs  of  the  Trojans ; 
Thine  were  the  shame,  should  that  sacred  corse  suffer  aught  of  de- 
filement." (180) 

Godlike  Achilles,  swift  in  the  race,  this  answer  returned  her: 
"  Iris  divine!  say,  which  of  the  Gods  from  Olympus  hath  sent  thee?" 
Iris,  swift  as  the  wind,  these  words  returned  him  in  answer : 
"  Hera,  the  glorious  consort  of  Zeus,  hath  sent  me  to  warn  thee. 
Nor,  where  he  sits  on  his  lofty  throne,  doth  almighty  Kronion 
Know  of  my  coming,  or  one  of  the  dwellers  on  snowy  Olympus." 

Then  in  his  turn  responded  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"  How  can  I  fight  unarmed  ?  In  the  hands  of  the  foe  is  mine  armour, 
Nor  does  my  mother  permit  me  to  arm  myself  for  the  battle, 


Book  XVI 1 1.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  403 

Till  I  behold  her  returning,  herself,  from  lofty  Olympus,  (r9°) 

Whence    she   hath   promised    to    bring    me    a    splendid    suit   from 

Hephaestus. 
Nor  do  I  know  the  man  indeed  whose  armour  would  fit  me, 
Save  the  enormous  shield  of  the  great  Telamonian  Aias. 
That  he  is  bearing  himself,  I  ween,  in  front  of  the  battle, 
Slaughtering  the  foe  with  his  mighty  spear  round  the  corse  of  Patro- 
clus." 

Iris,  swift  as  the  winds,  these  words  returned  him  in  answer : 
"  Well  we  know  that  the  foe  possess  thy  glittering  armour : 
Shew  thyself  at  the  trench  albeit,  unarmed,  to  the  Trojans 
There  as  thou  stand'st.     At  thy  sight  they  will  shrink  with  fear,  and 
retreating  (i99) 

Give  some  respite  from  war,  some  breathing  time,  to  the  Grecians, 
Wearied  with  fighting.     However  brief,  '  twill  suffice  them  to  i-ally." 

Thus  having  said,  departed  the  wind-swift  messenger  Iris. 
Up  then  Achilles  arose,  belov'd.  of  Zeus,    and  Athene 
Flung  round  his  mighty  shoulders  the  fringed  orb  Of  her  ^Egis. 
Over  him  poured  the  Goddess  a  golden  cloud,  like  a  glory 
Circling  his  head,  which  a  dazzling  light  shot  round  him  071  all  sides. 
As  in  some  close-beleaguered  town  by  foemen  invested 
Far  in  some  sea-girt  isle,  a  rising  smoke  from  the  ramparts 
Curls,  when  the  day  has  closed  on  a  fierce  and  desperate  sally, 
Down  sinks  the  sun,  and  the  shades  descend ;   then  blaze  forth  the 
beacons,  (2I°) 

One  succeeding  another,  from  all  the  toufrs;  and  their  splendour 
Flashes  aloft  to  the  sky,  which  watchful  friends  on  the  main-land 
Haply  perceiving,  their  ships  may  launch,  and  haste  to  the  rescue  : 
Thus  to  the  skies  that  glory  streamed  from  the  head  of  Achilles. 
Passing  beyond  the  wall,  to  the  trench  he  advanced,  from  the  Grecians 
Holding  aloof,  and  revering  the  sage  advice  of  his  mother. 
Taking  his   stand,   he  sent  forth  a  shout ;  and  Pallas  Athene 
Added  her  voice.     Unspeakable  terror  seized  on  the  Trojans. 
Clear  as  the  trumpet's  note,  which  beneath  the  walls  of  a  fortress 
Rings  out  defiance  and  death  from  besieging  foes  to  its  inmates.     (220) 
Thus  resounded  the  cry  sent  forth  by  ^Eacus'  offspring,

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XVIII. 


Ringing  with  brazen  clang.     Each  Trojan  warrior  who  heard  it 
Quailed  in  his  inmost  soul:  and  their  very  horses  in  terror 
Sprang  short  round  with  their  cars,  instinct  with  foresight  of  mischief. 
Panic  o'erwhelmed  their  charioteers,  who  beheld,  with  amazement 
Mingled  with  awe,  the  glory  that  flamed  from  the  head  of  Peleides, 
Blazing  with  restless  beams,  enkindled  by  blue-eyed  Athene. 
Thrice  from  the  brink  of  the  trench  loud  shouted  godlike  Achilles  : 
Thrice  did  the  Trojans  and  brave  allies  start  back  in  confusion. 
Dashed  from  their  chariots  were  twelve  of  the  best  and  bravest  among 
them:  (230) 

Crushed  by  the  cars,  or  hurled  on  each  other's  lances,  they  perished. 

Joyfully  bore  the  Greeks  Patroclus  now  from  the  weapons. 
Stretched  on  a  bier  he  lay,  and  around  him  his  faithful  companions, 
Grieving,  were  ranged.     Achilles  himself  the  mournful  procession 
Followed  in  tears.     He  wept  for  his  trusted  friend  and  his  comrade, 
There  on  his  bier  extended,  with  lances  pierced  and  with  arrows; 
Him,  whom  so  late  exulting  he  sent  with  his  steeds  and  his  chariot 
Forth  to  the  war,  ah  !  never  again  in  life  to  behold  him. 

Now  the  unwearied  sun,  at  the  sov'reign  mandate  of  Here, 
Sank,  unwilling,  to  rest  in  the  broad  expanse  of  the  ocean.    (240) 
Down  it  plunged;  and  the  Greeks,  though  brave,  worn  out  with  their 

labours, 
Rested  from  war's  alarm,  and  the  horrors  of  mutual  slaughter. 
While  on  their  part,  from  the  battle-field  the  Trojans  retreating, 
Freed  from  the  chariot  yoke  their  wearied  steeds,  and  in  council 
Gathered,  in  anxious  debate,  postponing  all  thought  of  refreshment. 
Standing  the  council  was  held.     Not  a  man  dared  sit,  for  a  terror 
Hung  on  the  spirits  of  all ;  and  the  dreadful  form  of  Achilles, 
Absent  so  long  from  the  war,  reappearing  now,  had  unmanned  them. 
First  to  speak  was  Polydamas,  Panthous'  son;  in  his  wisdom 
Looking  before  and  after,  alone  he  stood  of  the  Trojans  :       (250) 
In  the  same  night  with  Hector  born,  from  youth  his  companion ; 
This  for  council  and  eloquence  famed,  and  that  for  his  prowess. 
Wisely  and  calmly  speaking  his  mind,  he  addressed  the  assembly  : 
"  Now  is  your  time  to  decide,  my  friends  !    the  advice  which  I  offer 
Is  to  return  to  the  city,  and  not  to  wait  till  the  morning 


Book  XVI I L]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  405 

Here  in  the  plain,   remote  as  we  are  from  our  walls  and  defences. 
Long  as  between  this  terrible  man  and  king  Agamemnon 
Wrath  and  contention  prevailed,  the  Greeks  were  less  to  be  dreaded. 
I  myself  could  encamp  with  joy  quite  close  to  their  vessels,  (259) 

Such  was  my  eager  hope  that  ere  long  we  should  capture  and  burn 

them. 
Now  am  I  filled  with  dread  at  the  swift  and  vengeful  Achilles. 
Such  is  his  fierce  and  daring  soul,  not  long  will  he  loiter 
Here   in   the   plain,    where   Trojans    and    Greeks   have   long   been 

accustomed 
In  fair  field,  with  alternate  success,  to  meet  and  to  battle. 
Now  must  we  fight  for  our  own  town  itself,  our  wives  and  our  infants. 
Be  persuaded.     Retire  to  the  city.     There  is  our  safety — 
Now,  while  ambrosial  night  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles 
Still  at  his  ships  detains.     If  here  he  should  find  us  to-morrow 
When  fresh  armed  he  shall  take  the  field,  full  many  a  Trojan 
What  Peleides  can  do  shall  learn.     Too  happy  the  mortal  (270) 

Then  who  to  Ilion's  walls  shall  escape,  nor  gorge  with  his  carcase 
Vultures  and  dogs.     May  tidings  like  these  from  my  ears  be  averted  I 
Now, — if  ye  take  my  advice  and  retreat  ('tis  grievous  I  grant  it,) 
Let  us  to-night  in  the  public  squares  assemble  our  warriors: 
Strong  are  our  buttressed  tow'rs,  and  high  the  gates  which  protect  us, 
Strongly  barred  with  enormous  beams,  well  fitted  and  fastened. 
Early  at  dawn  let  us  man  the  walls,  full  armed  and  appointed. 
Then,  should  he  venture  up  from  the  ships,  right  hard  will  he  find  it, 
Range  as  he  may  beneath  our  walls,  to  assault  or  to  hurt  us.        (279) 
Round  them  in  circuit  wide  let  his  proud  steeds  sweep,  with  his  chariot. 
Back  to  his  ships,  fatigued  with  their  useless  course,  shall  they  bear  him  : 
Nor  will  he  dare,  methinks,  to  attempt  an  assault  on  the  city. 
Troy  falls  not  to  Achilles  !  The  dogs  shall  sooner  devour  him." 
Bending  upon  him  a  look  severe  thus  Hector  responded  : 
"  Most  displeasing,  Prince  !   is  such  counsel  to  me,  and  unwelcome. 
Wouldst  thou  advise  us  again  to  mew  ourselves  up  in  the  city  ? 
Hast  thou  not  long  enough  remained  cooped  in  by  our  ramparts? 
Famed  was  the  city  of  Priam  in  former  times  for  its  riches; 
All  men  spake  of  its  brass,  its  gold,  its  boundless  resources. 


406  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

Now    from    its   gorgeous    domes    have    their    wealth    and    treasure 

departed,  (29°) 

Scattered  abroad  and  sold,  in  Maeonia  fair,  and  in   Phrygia, 
Since  that  day  when  the  wrath  of  Zeus  was  kindled  against  us. 
Now,  when  at  length  th'  all  pow'rful  son  of  mysterious  Kronos 
Grants  me  to  triumph,  to  hem  in  the  Greeks  on  the  shore,  at  their 

vessels, 
Foolish  man  !  wouldst  thou  utter  such  words  as  these  to  the  people  ? 
Think  not  a  Trojan  will  heed  them,  or  I  stand  by  and  permit  it ! 
Now  then  list  to  my  words.     Let  all  give  heed  and  obey  them. 
Serve  out  their  evening  meal  to  the  soldiers,  squadron  by  squadron. 
Look  to  the  watch.     Let  all  be  alert  and  ready  for  action. 
If  there  be  one  of  the   Trojans   who   hugs   his   wealth   and  would 

save  it,  (30°) 

Now  let  him  bring  it  forth  and  divide  it  all  with  the  people  j 
Better  the  meanest  Trojan  should  take  his  share  than  an  Argive. 
At  the  first  break  of  to-morrow's  dawn,  full  armed  and  appointed, 
All  be  prepared  for  a  fresh  and  fierce  attack  on  their  vessels ; 
And  should  Achilles  indeed  arise  once  more  to  defend  them, 
So  much  the  worse  for  him,  he  will  find  me  ready  to  meet  him ; 
Nor  will  I  shrink  from  his  stern  assault.     In  the  contest  for  glory 
He  who  may  conquer  wins,  but  the  hero  who  falls  has  conferred  it. 
Ares  is  just,  and  the  slayer  himself  is  slain,  if  he  will  it." 

Thus    spake    Hector,    and    answ'ring    with    shouts   the   Trojans 

applauded;  (310) 

Blind  as  they  were,  by  Pallas  Athena  deprived  of  their  reason. 
All  of  them  chose,  with  Hector,  the  path  that  led  to  destruction : 
None  with  Polydamas  sided,  whose  plans  would  have  placed  them  in 

safety. 
So  to  their  evening  meal  they  went.     Meanwhile  the  Achaians 
Mourning  stood  round  Patroclus'  bier  all  night,  and  lamented, 
Echoing  the  ceaseless  moans  and  outcries  wild  of  Peleides. 
Bent  o'er  the  dead,  his  slaughtering  hands  he  placed  on  his  bosom, 
Sending  forth  frequent  groans :  as  a  bearded  and  terrible  lion 
Robbed  of  his  whelps,  while  roaming  for  prey,  by  some  wandering 

hunter, 


Book  XVIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  407 

Back  to  his  den  from  the  wild  returning,  misses  his  offspring  :         (320) 
Then  through  the  woods  and  vales  he  tracks  the  steps  of  the  robber, 
Roaring  with  rage :  and  woe  to  the  hapless  wretch  if  he  find  him. 
Thus  to  the  Myrmidons  standing  round  he  poured  forth  his  sorrows  : 
M  Vain,  alas  !    how  vain  was  my  pledge  to  the  hero  Mencetius, 
Giv'n  to  console  his  grief,  when  I  vowed  in  the  halls  of  our  palace 
Safe  to  restore  his  son  to  his  native  city — to  Opus — 
Rich  with  the  spoil  of  captured  Troy,  triumphant  and  honoured. 
Such  are  the  dreams  of  men,  and  thus  fulfilled  by  Kronion. 
Here  by  a  common  fate  upon  Troia's  soil  are  we  destined  (329) 

Both  to   pour  forth  our  blood.     For  ne'er   shall  Peleus  my  father 
Welcome  me  back  to  Phthids  shores,  nor  Thetis  behold  me 
In  the  loved  series  of  my  youth :  for  here  one  grave  shall  receive  us. 
But  since  awhile,  Patroclus  !    on  earth  I  must  linger  behind  thee, 
Only  so  long  unpaid  be  thy  fun'ral  rites,  till  I  bring  thee, 
Soothing  thy  shade,  the  spoils  and  the  head  of  thy  murderer  Hector. 
Twelve  of  the  noblest  Trojan  youth,  to  vengeance  devoted, 
Slain  by  my  hand,  round  thy  fun'ral  pyre  shall  bleed,  as  thy  victims. 
Here  shalt  thou  rest  meanwhile  by  the  high-beak'd  ships,  and  around 

thee 
High-bosomed  Trojan  and  Dardan  dames  shall  stand  and  bemoan  thee, 
Pouring  forth  daily  and  nightly  tears  and  loudly  lamenting :         (340) 
Captives  won  by  our  conqu'ring  spears  in  the  days  when  together, 
Fighting,  we  plundered  and  burned  full  many  a  populous  city." 
Thus  lamented  Achilles,  and  called  his  attendants  about  him, 
Bidding  them  place  on  the  fire  a  tripod  vase,  and  with  water 
Lave  from  the  dust  and  gore  the  sad  remains  of  Patroclus. 
Soon  o'er  the  fire  a  cauldron  vast  they  set,  and  beneath  it 
Heaped  up  a  pile  of  blazing  wood,  and  filled  it  with  water. 
Played  round  the  sides  of  the  vase  the  flames,  and  simmered  the 

water. 
Then,  while  the  bubbles  hissed  round  the  gleaming  rim  of  the  vessel, 
Carefully  washed  they  the  corse,  and  with  costliest  unguents  anointed, 
Salving  its  wounds  with  balms  nine  circling  seasons  had  mellowed. 
Then  on  a  lofty  couch  they  laid  the  corse,  and  in  linen 
Wrapped  it  from  head  to  foot,  and  a  white  sheet  o'er  it  extended. 


4o8  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

Standing  around,  through  the  rest  of  the  night  the  Myrmidon  warriors 
Answered,  with  groan  for  groan  and  with  sigh  for  sigh,  to  Achilles. 
Zeus  then  these  words  to  Hera  addressed,  his  sister  and  consort : 
"  Queen  of  the  large  resplendent  eyes  !    thy  wish  is  accomplished, 
Swift  Achilles  is  roused.     One  would  think,  so  dearly  thou,  lov'st  them, 
Thine  by  direct  descent  were  the  long-haired  sons  of  Achaia." 

Rolling  her  large  majestic  eyes  thus  Hera  responded  :  (360) 

"  Dread   and    severe    Kronion !   what   words    are   these    thou    hast 

uttered  ? 
Surely  a  mortal  man  might  have  done  so  much  for  a  mortal. 
Needs  not  thepow'r  nor  wisdom  of  Gods  such  feats  to  accomplish. 
And  shall  not  I,  the  Queen  of  heav'n,  the  first  in  Olympus 
After  thyself,  by  birth,  and  to  thee  united  in  wedlock — 
Consort  of  Zeus  !    who  rules  o'er  all,  both  men  and  immortals — 
Wreak  my  wrath  on  a  nation  I  loathe  and  abhor  like  the  Trojans  ?" 

Such  their  discourse  on  high.     Meanwhile  from  the  ocea?i  ascending 
Silvery-footed  Thetis  at  length  to  the  halls  of  Hephaestus 
Came;  to  that  bright  and  starry  dome,  incorruptible,  brazen     (370) 
Marvel  of  heav'n,  which  the  limping  God  for  himself  had  constructed. 
Bathed  in  sweat  she  found  him,  and  labouring  hard  at  the  bellows. 
Twenty  tripods  of  wondrous  frame  the  God  was  preparing, 
Ranged  round  the  walls  of  his  palace  hall  to  stand;  and  revolving 
Under  the  base  of  each  were  golden  wheels,  which  should  bear  them 
Self-transported,  instincl  with  life,  to  the  heavenly  conclave  ; 
Self-transported  convey  them  back,  and  arrange  the?n  in  order. 
All,  so  far,  were  complete.     There  wanted  only  the  handles : 
These  he  was  now  about  to  fix,  and  was  forging  the  rivets.  (379) 

Thus,  as  with  thoughtful  mind  and  with  skilful  hand  he  was  toiling, 
Thetis  the  snowy-footed  approached  the  scene  of  his  labours. 
Her  beholding,  Charis  the  fair,  the  wife  of  Hephaestus, 
Veiled  with  a  tissue  of  purest  white  advanced  to  receive  her; 
Cordially  pressed  her  hand;  and  endearingly  named  and  addressed  her: 
"  Thetis,  belov'd  and  revered  !  what  brings  thee  here  to  our  palace, 
Richly  attired  ?   Not  often  of  old  wert  thou  wont  to  frequent  it. 
Enter  I  pray  thee,  at  once,  and  receive  our  heartiest  welcome." 
Thus  spake  the  Goddess,  as  leading  her  guest,  she  entered  the  palace. 


Book  XVI II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  409 

Seating  her  then  on  a  gorgeous  throne,  all  shining  with  silver 
Wrought  into  rich  devices,  her  feet  she  raised  on  a  footstool.        (390) 
Then  from  his  work  Hephaestus  called,  and  thus  she  addressed  him  : 
"  Hasten,  Hephaestus.     Thetis  is  here,  and  needs  thy  assistance." 
Then  in  his  turn  replied  the  limping  lord  of  the  furnace : 
"  Honour' d  indeed  are  these   halls  by  a  presence  so.  dear  and   so 

gracious. 
Thetis  it  was  who  preserved  me  from  horrible  ills,  when  my  mother 
Tossed  me  away  with  savage  and  pitiless  scorn ; — the  deformed  one 
Whom  she  would  fain  have  hidden.     Oh  !    then  what  woes  had  I 

suffered, 
Had  not  Eurynome,  daughter  of  refluent  ocean,  and  Thetis 
Caught  me  falling,  and  wanned  in  their  gentle  bosoms,  and  nursed  met 
There   nine   years   m  their  hollow  caves    I   lived ;    and   to   please 

them  (400) 

Wrought  for  them  many  a  quaint  device — clasps,  bracelets  and  buckles, 
Pendants  and  chains  :  while  around  and  above  the  wide-foaming  ocean 
Murmured  in  ceaseless  flow.     There  alike  from  Gods  and  from  mortals 
Hidden  I  grew,  nor  did  one  know  aught  of  my  place  of  concealment 
Saving  these  two,  Eurynome  kind  and  Thetis,  who  reared  me. 
Fair-haired  Thetis  is  now  beneath  my  roof.     Let  me  shew  her 
All  the  respecT  and  love  I  owe  to  my  nurse  and  my  saviour; 
Place  before  her  the  best  our  palace  affords;   while  I  hasten, 
Bellows  and  tools  laid  all  aside,  to  prepare  me  to  meet  her." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  his  mighty  bulk  upreared  from  the  anvil    (410) 
Halting.     His  feeble  and  awkward  legs  bestirred  themselves  briskly. 
First,  from  the  fire  the  bellows  he  moved ;  and,  collected  together, 
Safely  stowed  in  a  silver  chest  the  tools  he  was  using. 
Then  with  a  sponge  he  cleansed  his  face,  his  hands,  and  his  brawny 
Neck,  and  his  shaggy  breast,  fro7?i  the  smoke  and  grime  of  the  furnace ; 
Flung  o'er  his  shoulders  a  robe;  his  sceptre  grasped;  and  proceeded 
Limping  forth  from  the  door  of  his  forge.     Two  golden  attendants, 
Formed  in  the  likeness  of  living  maids,  supported  the  Monarch. 
(Each  has  within  it  a  living  soul ;   with  speech  are  they  gifted ; 
Strength  is  theirs,  and  with  arts  and  skill  the  Gods  have  endowed 

them.)  (420) 


410  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

These,  as  he  limped  along,  sustained  the  steps  of  Hephaestus, 
Till  by  the  side  of  Thetis  a  gorgeous  throne  he  ascended, 
Cordially  pressed  her  hand,  endearingly  named  and  addressed  her  : 
"  Thetis,  belov'd  and  revered  !   What  brings  thee  now  to  our  palace 
Richly  attired?    Not  often  of  old  wert  thou  wont  to  frequent  it. 
Speak,  thy  wishes  declare ;  thou  shalt  find  me  ready  and  willing ; 
If  it  be  aught  that  a  God  may  do,  and  if  I  can  perform  it." 
Dropping  a  tear  as  she  spake,  thus  Thetis  mournfully  answered  : 
"Is  there  a  Goddess,  Hephaestus,  inhabiting  lofty  Olympus, 
Forced,  like  myself,  by  Zeus  to  drain  the  cup  of  affliction  ?  (430) 

Is  there,  among  them  all,  one,  half  so  wretched  as  Thetis  ? 
Me,  among  all  the  nymphs  of  the  deep  to  a  man  he  subjected — 
Wedded  to  Peleus — forced  to  endure  the  embrace  of  a  mortal — 
Sorely  against  my  will.     And  there  he  lies  in  his  palace 
Feeble  and  broken  with  age.     Nor  is  this  the  sum  of  my  sorrows. 
Fruit  of  our  marriage  a  son  I  bore,  and  tefiderly  nursed  him, 
Noblest  of  heroes !    As  some  fair  tree  shoots  up  from  a  sapling 
Planted  in  fertile  soil,  in  grace  he  grew,  and  in  vigour. 
Grown  up  to  man's  estate,  in  his  ships  to  Ilion  I  sent  him 
There  with  the  Trojans  to  fight.     Ah  !  never  again  to  revisit       (440) 
Home,  or  re-enter  the  ancient  halls  of  Peleus  his  father. 
Still  with  corroding  grief  are  his  days  consumed;  and  in  sorrow 
Passes  his  life  away;  nor  can  I  do  aught  to  relieve  him. 
He  from  the  Greeks  received  a  beauteous  maid  as  his  portion, 
Whom  from  his  arms  Agamemnon  imjustly  tore,  a?id  detains  her. 
Grief  and  despair  for  her  loss  consumed  his  soul ;  while  the  Trojans 
Drove  back  the  Greeks  to  their  ships,  and  hemmed  them  in,  nor  per- 
mitted 
Forth  from  their  gates  to  advance.     Then  came  the  chiefs  of  their 

council 
Begging  his  aid,  and  proffring  unbounded  wealth,  to  appease  him. 
All  he  refused  :  nor,  himself,  did  aught  to  avert  their  destruction.  (450) 
Yet  he  permitted  his  friend  Patroclus  to  fight ;  and  his  armour 
Lent  him,  and  forth  to  the  battle  he  went,  with  many  a  warrior. 
All  day  long  at  the  Scaean  gate  they  fought,  and  the  city 
Surely  that  very  day  had  they  captured,  but  that  Apollo 


Book  XVIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  411 

Came,  and  struck  down  in  his  full  career  of  conquest  and  triumph 
Valiant  Mencetius'  son,  and  transferred  the  glory  to  Hector. 
Therefore  a  suppliant  to  thee  I  come  and  entreat  thine  assistance 
Arms  to  supply  for  my  short-lived  son  :  a  shield  and  a  helmet, 
Beauteous  greaves,  well  fitted  with  buckles  and   clasps,  and  a  corslet. 
Those    which    he    had    he    lost,    when    his     faithful     friend    and 

companion  (460) 

Fell;   for  whose    death  he  mourns,  on   the   ground    extended   and 

weeping." 
Then  to  her  words  replied  the  limping  Lord  of  the  furnace  : 
"  Be  of  good  cheer.    Distress  not  thy  mind  with  cares  for  his  armour. 
Would  that  with  equal  ease  I  could  snatch  thy  son  from  destruction 
When  at  the  fated  hour,  his  death,  foretold,  is  approaching, 
As  I  shall  make  him  a  glorious  suit,  the  wonder  of  all  men, 
Such  as  was  ne'er  beheld  by  mortal  eyes  for  its  beauty." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  he  left  her  there,  and  returned  to  his  bellows ; 
Turned  on  the  fire  their  nozzles  and  bid  them  blow.     At  his  orders 
Twenty  bellows  their  streams  of  wind  sent  forth  on  the  furnace    (470) 
Raising  a  varied  blast,  now  strong,  now  soft,  as  Hephaestus 
Now  urging  on  his  work  required  their  aid,  now  desisted, 
Letting  it  cool  awhile,  that  all  might  be  duly  completed. 
Into  the  furnace  he   cast  the  stubborn  bronze,  and  he  melted 
Tin,  and  the  precious  gold,  and  the  gleaming  silver  :  the  anvil 
Raising,  next  on  its  block  he  placed ;  and  the  ponderous  hammer 
Grasped  with  his  strong  right  hand.     With  his  left  he  handled  the 

forceps. 
First  did  he  frame  a  vast  and  solid  shield,  with  devices 
Richly  enchased,    and  around  its  margin  a  glittering  border 
Threefold  and  polished  he  led;  with  a  silver  sling  to  sustain  it.    (480) 
Five  were  the  plates  which   its   substance  formed :   the   outer  with 

sculpture 
Covered,  with  rich  inventive  skill  wrought  out  by  the  artist. 
There  he  depictured  the  earth,  and  the  canopied  sky,  and  the  ocean, 
There  the  unwearied  sun,  and  the  full-orb'd  moon  in  their  courses. 
All  the  configured  stars,  which  gem  the  circuit  of  heaven, 
Pleiads,  and  Hyads  were  there,  and  the  giant  force  of  Orion. 


412  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

There  the  revolving  Bear  (which  the  Wain  they  call)  was  ensculptured 
Circling  on  high,  and  in  all  its  course  regarding  Orion, 
Sole  of  the  starry  train  which  refuses  to  bathe  in  the  ocean. 

These    in     the    midst.      In    the    circuit    round    two     cities    were 
sculptured,  (49°) 

Fair  to  behold.     In  one  were  marriage  processions  and  feasting. 
There  were  the  brides,  by  the  torches'  blaze  led  forth  from  their  cham- 
bers 
All  through   the    streets;    while   in   chorus   the  bridal  hymns 'were 

resounding  : 
Youths  in  the  festal  dance  whirled  deftly  round,  and  among  them 
Harpers  and  pipers  played  to  mark  the  tiine,  while  the  matrons, 
Each  at  her  door,  as  the  train  passed  by,  stood  gazing  in  wonder. 
There  too  the  forum  was  shewn,  with  people  thronged,  to  a  trial 
List'ning;  where  for  a  ransom  two  angry  men  were  disputing, 
Due  for  a  townsman  slain.     The  one  insists  he  has  paid  it, 
While   his   opponent   maintains   he   has   nought   received.     To   the 
people  (5°°) 

Each  has  appealed,  and  a  judge  they  seek  to  settle  their  quarrel. 
Some  of  the  crowd  for  one,  and  some  declare  for  the  other. 
Heralds  meanwhile  the  tumult  appease.     The  elders  are  seated 
Solemn,  in   sacred  array  on  marble  chairs  in  a  circle. 
One,  in  his  turn,  has  received  the  herald's  staff,  and  uprising 
Duly  explains  his  view  of  the  case,  and  delivers  his  judgment : 
While  in  the  midst,  two  talents  of  gold  lie  heaped,  for  the  suitor 
Destined,  whose  pleaded  cause  shall  best  be  approved  by  the  judges. 
Round  the  next  sculptured  town  two  hostile  bands  were  assembled, 
Shining  in  arms.     A  two-fold  mind  divides  the  besiegers;        (510) 
These  would  destroy  the  city,  and  those  but  plunder  and  spoil  it, 
All  the  treasure  and  wealth  it  contains  dividing  among  them. 
Unsubdued,  the  besieged  for  a  secret  ambush  were  arming. 
Watchful,  along  the  walls  their  wives  and  innocent  children 
Stood  looking  forth  with  anxious  gaze;  the  old  and  the  feeble. 
Forth  march'd  the  youth,  by  Ares  led  and  Pallas  Athene 
(These  were  of  gold,  and  golden-clad,  in  beauteous  armour; 
Tall  in  stature  and  lofty  in  mien,  as  beseeming  their  Godhead, 


BookXVIIL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  413 

Radiant  they  stalked  and  gigantic.     The  men  were  dwarfed  in  pro- 
portion). 
Now   to   a   spot    are    they   come    for    their    ambush    meet,   by   a 
river,  (520) 

Just  where  a  watering-place  for  all  sorts  of  cattle  expanded. 
There  in  resplendent  arms  they  crouch  them  down  in  concealment. 
Far  in  advance  two  spies  are  set,  looking  out  for  the  shepherds 
Notice  to  give,  should  horned   steers   or  sheep  be  approaching. 
(These  might  be  seen,  coming  on  :  two  shepherds,  driving  their  cattle  : 
Piping  they  came,  suspecting  nought,  and  thoughtless  of  mischief.) 
Soon  as  beheld,  the  ambushed  foe,  upstarting,  attack  them, 
Slaught'ring  at  once  the  herds  of  kine,  dispersing  and  killing 
All  the  fair  flocks  of  snowy  sheep,  and  slaying  the  shepherds. 
Soon   as   the  cries   of  the  slayers   and   slain,  and   the   roar   of  the 
oxen  (530) 

Reach  to  the  hostile  camp  where  the  chiefs  are  sitting  in  council, 
Straightway  their  cars  they  mount  and  fly  to  the  scene  of  the  uproar. 
Soon  as  arrived  at  the  river's  bank  they  rush  into  battle. 
Fighting  is  seen,  and  the  spears  and  darts  fly  thickly  between  them. 
Tumult  and  direful  Strife  were  there.     Fate  mixed  in  the  combat, 
Sheltering  these,  and  wounding  those.     One  slain  in  the  struggle 
Seized  by  the  feet  she  drags  along  through  the  midst  of  the  carnage. 
Red  with  the  blood  of  men  is  the  robe  she  wears  round  her  shoulders. 
All  to  the  life  were  shewn.     They  fight — they  slay — and  they  struggle 
Or  o'er  the  dead  they  bend,  and  drag  them  off,  to  despoil  them. 

Next  was  presented  a  fallow  field,  soft,  rich,  and  extensive,      (541) 
Now  for  the  third  time  ploughed ;  and  across  it  many  a  ploughman 
Backward  and  forward  was  driving  his  team  and  leading  his  furrow. 
Soon  as  the  boundary  line  each  reached,  and  was  turning  his  plough- 
share, 
One  stood  ready  to  hand  him  a  flowing  cup,  to  refresh  him, 
Brimming  with  honied  wine.     Then  back  they  turned  in  their  order, 
Each  retracing  his  line  to  the  utmost  verge  of  the  fallow. 
Black  seemed  the  land  behind,  where  the  ploughs  had  passed,  as  with 

tillage ; 
Golden  albeit.     Such  was  the  wondrous  skill  of  the  artist. 


4H  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XVIII. 

Next  was  there  shewn  a  field  of  corn  deep-waving,  where  reapers, 
Each  with  his  sharpened  sickle  in  hand,  were  securing  the  harvest.  (551) 
Handful  by  handful  it  sank  to  their  sturdy  strokes,  and  in  order 
Lay  the  cut  bundles.     These  into  sheaves  the  binders  were  tying. 
Three  were  the  binders  of  sheaves,  with  attendant  boys,  who  the  reapers 
Followed;  gath'ring  the  handfuls  of  corn  in  their  arms,  to  supply  them 
Fast  as  they  tied  up  the  sheaves.     Apart  stood  the  master  in  silence, 
Leaning  upon  his  staff,  and  with  joy  surveying  the  produce. 
Under  an  oak,  where  an  ox  was  slain,  the  heralds  attendant 
Harvest  rites  performed,  and  a  feast  prepared :   while  the  women 
Sprinkled  the  meat  with  plenty  of  barley-flour  for  the  reapers.       (560) 

Changed  was  the  scene,     A  vineyard  was  shewn,  with  grapes  for  the 
vintage 
Heavily  laden.     The  vines  were  gold,  and  black  were  the  clusters 
Thick  intertwining  on  silver  poles  the  plants  were  supported. 
Round  it  a  trench  of  azure  steel  was  drawn,   and  to  fence  it 
Rose  up  a  bank  in  tin.     One  only  pathway  across  it 
Passed,  and  allowed  access,  in  the  vintage  time,  to  the  bearers. 
Youths  and  maidens,  joyous  of  heart,  unconscious  of  evil, 
Bore  to  the  press  the  luscious  fruit  in  baskets  of  wicker, 
While  in  their  midst  a  lad  went  harping  along,  and  reciting 
Songs  handed  down  from  Linus  of  old,  to  his  music  adapted,  (57°) 

Trilling  with  slender  and  boyish  voice ;  while  the  rest  in  the  chorus 
Joined,  keeping  time  with  their  feet,  as  they  danced  and  skipped 
to  the  measure. 

Next  was  presented  a  herd  of  oxen,  driv'n  to  their  pasture, 
Carrying  erect  their  horns.    Of  gold  and  of  tin  were  they  moulded 
Various.    Forth  from  the  stalls  loud  lowing  they  rushed,  where  a  river 
Murmuring  rolled,  and  the  bord'ring  reeds  waved  high  in  the  breezes. 
Four  were  the  herdsmen  of  gold  who  marched  beside  them,  and  careful, 
Tended  the  drove:  and  nine  swift  dogs  followed  close  on  their  footsteps. 
Lo  !  where  in  front  of  the  herd  two  fierce  and  terrible  lions 
Seize  on  the  bellowing  bull,  and,  despite  his  struggles  and  roaring,  (580) 
Drag  him  away;  while  dogs  and  herdsmen  run  to  the  rescue. 
Tearing  the  skin  of  the  mighty  beast  they  stand,  and  his  entrails 
Gorge,  and  the  dark  and  streaming  blood  they  lap,  while  the  herdsmen 


Book  XVIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  415 

Close  up  in  vain,  and  in  vain  cheer  on  their  dogs  to  attack  them. 
These,  though  they  snarl  a n d  shew  their  teeth,  refuse  to  approach  them; 
Standing  aloof,  though  near,  they  bark,  yet  shun  the  encounter. 

Xext.  by  the  skill  of  Hephaestus  a  gentler  scene  was  depictured: 
Snow-white  flocks  in  a  verdant  mead,  among  sheltering  woodlands ; 
Folds;  and  the  shepherds'  tents;  and  the  peaceful roof  of  the  cottage. 

Fell  owing  this  was  enchased  a  dance,  like  that  which  at  Gnossus  (590) 
Daedalus  first  with  ingenious  skill  devised  {when  in   Creta 
-Refuge  he  sought),  to  delight  the  fair-haifd  queen  Ariadne. 
Blooming  youths  and  attractive  maidens  danced  in  a  circle. 
Joining  hands,  and  grasping  each  other  s  wrists,  as  they  bounded. 
Soft  white  linen  expressed,  while  it  veiled,  the  forms  of  the  damsels; 
Glancing,  and  glazed,  as  with  oil,  shone   bright  the  attire  of  their 

partners. 
Each  fair  head  with  a  flowery  wreath  was  crown'd ;  and  a  falchion, 
Golden,  in  baldric  of  silver  each  youth  from  his  shoulder  suspended. 
Xow  in  a  ring  they  fly  with  practised  feet,  as  a  potter  (599) 

"Whirls  with  his  hand,  where  he  sits,  the  forming  wheel,  and  examines 
Xicely  its  balanced  course  as  it  spins  and  sleeps  on  its  centre: 
Now  from  opposing  ranks  they  cross,  interlacing  each  other. 
Gazing  delighted  the  crowd  stand  round.    Beside  them  a  harper, 
Sings  to  his  lyre  a  sacred  lay,  thus  marking  the  measure; 
While  at  the  sound  of  his  harp  in  the  midst  two  tumblers  advancing 
Spin  round  each  other,  and  gambol  and  vault  in  time  to  his  music. 

Such  was  the  perfect  orb;  and  the  might}-  stream  of  the  ocean 
Rolled  round  its  border  in  wavy  gold,  completing  its  circuit. 

Now  when  that  vast  and  solid  shield  Hephaestus  had  finished, 
Brighter  than  flame  itself,  a  breastplate  next  he  constructed.         (610) 
Then,  too,  a  casque  he  formed,  to  the  hero's  temples  adjusted, 
Nodding  with  waving  plumes,  and  a  cone  of  gold  to  support  them, 
Greaves,  moreover,  of  ductile  and  burnished  tin  he  provided. 

Thus  were  the  glorious  arms  at  length  complete,  and  Hephaestus, 
Bringing  them  forth,  his  work  displayed  to  the  wondering  Goddess : 
She,  at  his  hands  receiving  the  gift,  from  snowy  Olympus 
Shot,  like  a  hawk,  and  bore  them  away  to  the  tent  of  Achilles.

Argument. 

Thetis  presents  to  Achilles  his  new  armour.  She  promises  to 
preserve  the  body  of  Patroclus  from  corruption,  and  bids  him  assemble 
the  army,  and  be  publicly  reconciled  with  Agamemnon.  Agamemnon 
restores  Briseis,  and  adds  rich  presents.  Achilles  desires  to  join  battle 
immediately,  but  Odysseus  dissuades  him.  Briseis  laments  over  the  body 
of  Patroclus.  Achilles  refuses  food,  but  is  strengthened  by  Pallas.  He 
arms  for  the  fight,  mounts  his  car,  and  reproaches  his  horses  for  having 
suffered  the  death  of  Patroclus.  One  of  them  replies,  and  predicls  his  own 
fate,  notwithstanding  which,  he  sets  forth  leading  his  troops  to  battle. 


ILIAD.     BOOK   XIX. 


Dawn,  in  her  saffron  robe  arrayed,  from  the  waves  of  the  Ocean 
Rose,  and  the  light  had  restored  alike  to  Gods  and  to  mortals, 
When  at  the  ships  the  Goddess  arrived  with  the  gifts  of  Hephaestus. 
Stretched  o'er  Patroclus'  corse  her  son  she  found,  in  his  anguish 
Sending  forth  piercing  cries,  while  around  him  wept  his  companions. 
Full  in  the  midst  of  them  all  the  Goddess  appeared,  and  approaching, 
Pressed  the  hand  of  her  son,  and  endearingly  naming,  bespoke  him  : 
"  Grieved  as  thou  art,  my  son,  let  the  dead  repose ;  and  remember 
'  Twas  but  the  will  of  heav'n  and  the  hand  of  a  God  that  subdued  him. 
Up !    now.       Receive     at     my    hands     these     splendid     gifts      of 

Hephaestus —  (10) 

Arms  such  as  ne'er  were  seen  the  grace  to  form  of  a  mortal." 
Thus  having  said,  she  arranged  the  arms  in  the  sight  of  Achilles ; 
Loudly  they  clanged  as  she  placed  on  the  ground  their  beauteous 

fabric. 
Seized  with  fear  were  the  Myrmidons  all.     Not  one  to  behold  them 
Ventured.     Aloof  they  trembling  stood.     Up  rose  then  Achilles, 
While  at  their  sight  rekindled  the  fire  in  his  soul,  and  his  eyeballs 
Glowed  from  beneath  his  gloomy  brows  with  a  terrible  splendour. 
Handling  them  all,  with  delight  he  received  the  gifts  of  the  Godhead. 
Poising  each  wond'rous  piece,  with  surprise  and  joy  he  surveyed  it. 
Gratefully  then  his  mother  addressed,  and  thus  he  bespake  her :    (20)

42o  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 


"  Mother !  the  works  of  a  God  indeed  hast  thou  brought.     In  their 

structure 
Skill  divine  is  displayed.     No  mortal  hand  could  have  wrought  them. 
Now  shall  I  shine  once  more  in  arms.     Yet,   alas  !   if  abandoned 
Here,  untended,  the  corse  of  the  valiant  son  of  Mencetius, 
Flies  will  assail ;  in  those  gaping  wounds  whence  issued  his  spirit 
Gendering  worms  obscejie ;  those  sacred  relics  defiling — 
(Now  that  their  life  is  fled) — and  his  flesh  will  sink  in  corruption." 

Thus  he  spake ;  and  the  silver-footed  Goddess  responded  : 
"  Let  not  these  pious  fears  for  thy  friend  hang  heavy  upon  thee ; 
Be  it  my  care  his  remains  to  tend,  and  chase  from  his  body  (30) 

All  the  fierce  host  of  flies,  which  infest  the  slain,  and  devour  them. 
Here,  for  a  year  entire  exposed  should  he  lie,  thou  shalt  find  him 
Still  uncorrupt,  his  remains  still  fresh  :  nay,  purer  than  mortal. 
Therefore  depart !  and  summon  the  Argive  chiefs  to  a  meeting ; 
There  renounce  thy  wrath  at  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Great  Agamemnon ;  then  arm  for  fight,  and  appear  in  thy  glory." 
Thus  having  spoken,  his  bosom  she  filled  with  daring  and  vigour. 
Then  in  Patroclus'  nostrils  ambrosia  instilled,  and  the  ruby 
Nectar,  the  corse  to  preserve,  and  secure  its  flesh  from  corruption. 

Now  by  the  ocean  strand  set  forth  the  godlike  Achilles,  (40) 

Shouting  aloud,  and  summoning  all  the  chiefs  of  the  Argives. 
Forthwith  assembled  the  Greeks  in  haste.    Ev'n  those  whom  their  duty 
Held  in  the  ships ;  the  steersmen  too,  from  the  sterns  of  their  vessels, 
Shipwrights,  purveyors,  dispensers  of  daily  food  to  the  army, 
All  came  forth ;   all  rushed  to  the  meeting,  now  that  Achilles 
Once  more  appeared,  so  long  estranged  from  the  perilous  conflict. 
Limping  slowly  along,  those  two  brave  servants  of  Ares, 
Mighty  Tydeides,  the  soul  of  war,  and  godlike  Odysseus 
Came,  on  their  spears  sustained,  their  wounds  still  rankling  and  painful. 
Forward   advancing,    their    seats    they   took,    in   the   front    of    the 
council.  (50) 

Last  came  Atreus'  son,  the  wide-ruling  king  Agamemnon, 
Sore  distrest  with  the  wound  which  Coon  the  son  of  Antenor 
Fighting  beneath  the  walls,  with  his  brazen  spear  had  inflicted. 

Now,  when  the  chiefs  had  met,  and  all  the  Greeks  were  assembled, 


Book  XIX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  421 

Godlike  Achilles,  swift  in  pursuit,  uprose  and  addressed  them : 

"  Atreus'  son  !    far  better  it  were  for  the  one  and  the  other, 

Happier  by  far  for  us  both  if,  ere  that  day  when  contention 

Rose  up   between  us,   and  angry  thoughts  on  account  of  Brisei's, 

Artemis'  shafts  had  laid  her  low,  in  the  ship  which  conveyed  her 

Home,  a  prize  to  my  conqu'ring  arms,  from  the  sack  of  Larissa.     (60) 

Then  had  been  spared  the  lives  of  those  hosts  of  Greeks  who  have 

perished, 
Biting  the  ground  beneath  hostile  spears,  while  I  cherished  my  anger. 
Heel  or  and  Troy  alone  by  our  strife  have  gained ;  but  the  Argives 
Long,  methinks,  of  our  -wrath  will  retain  a  bitter  remembrance. 
Now  let  us  fling  it  aside  as  a  thing  of  the  past,  though  it  vexed  us. 
Bending  our  souls  to  the  present  need  and  taming  our  anger. 
I  for  my  part  dismiss  my  wrath.     It  becomes  not  a  mortal 
Hate  undying  to  cherish.     Then  lose  no  time,  but  to  action 
Summon  at  once  thy  crested  Greeks,  and  array  them  for  battle. 
Give  me  to  try  once  more  in  the  field  the  strength  of  the  Trojans.  (70) 
Harldly  another  night  will  they  camp  in  front  of  our  vessels. 
Happy  the  man  who  shall  fastest  run,  and  escaping  my  vengeance 
Stretch  him  to  rest  this  night  beyond  the  reach  of  my  weapon." 
Thus    he    spake.     Loud   clamoured   with   joy   the    Greeks    when 
Peleides 
Once  more  they  heard,  adopting  their  cause,  renouncing  his  anger. 
Then,  the  assembly  addressing,  the  ruler  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
Spake  from  his  throne  where  he  sate ;  nor  quitting  his  place  nor  ad- 
vancing : 
"  Friends  and  heroes  of  Greece,  ye  valiant  servants  of  Ares  ! 
Whoso  may  rise  to  speak,  should  be  quietly  heard  and  in  silence ; 
For,  be  ye  never  so  wise,  to  interrupt  is  unseemly.  (80) 

Who  can  be  heard,  or  who  can  hear  in  so  wild  a  confusion? 
Such  as  the  loudest  would  drown,  or  confound  the   most   eloquent 

speaker. 
Let  me  be  heard,  when  to  Peleus'  son  I  would  speak,  and,  ye  Argives  ! 
Lend  an  attentive  ear,  and  mark  each  word  that  I  utter. 
Much  have  ye  blamed  me  for  what  has  passed,  ye  sons  of  Achaia ! 
This  have  I  not  to  learn.     Yet  not  to  your  king  was  it  owing 


422  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 


Zeus  was  to  blame  and  Fate,  and  that  fiend  of  darkness,  Erynnys, 
Who  on  that  ill-starred  day  when  I  forced  his  prize  from  Achilles 
Filled  my  soul  with  despite  and  rage  in  the  public  assembly. 
What  could  I  do  ?  The  Gods  as  they  will  dispose  of  our  actions,  (90) 
Ate  it  was,  dread  daughter  of  Zeus,  misleader  of  all  men, 
Mischief-making.     Her  noiseless  feet,  as  she  steals  on  her  viclims, 
Mark  not  the  ground.    O'er  the  heads  of  men  she  marches,  and  evil 
Sows  in  each  heart  as  she  goes.    Nor  me  alone  did  she  visit. 
Zeus  himself,  of  old,  she  misled,  who,  supreme  over  mortals, 
Holds  everlasting  sway,  and  o'er  all  the  Gods.    At  her  bidding 
Hera  with  female  wiles  her  lord  deceived,  when  in  Thebae 
Time  brought  round  th' .expected  day  when  beauteous  Alcmene*, 
Pregnant  by  Zeus,  should  give  to  the  light  the  might  of  Heracles. 
Thus  spake  Zeus,  with  paternal  pride,  to  the  heavenly  assembly  :  (100) 
'Hear!  ye  Gods  and  Goddesses  all,  who  inhabit  Olympus, 
What  the  prophetic  spirit  within  me  prompts  me  to  utter. 
This  day  shall  see,  by  th'  Ilythian  pow'rs  that  preside  over  child-birth, 
Brought  into  light,  a  mighty  prince  who  shall  rule  o'er  the  nations, 
Chief  of  a  race  of  heroes,  my  own  immediate  descendants.' 
Hera,  who  heard  the  boast,  devising  mischief,  addressed  him  : 
'What  thou  hast  said  can  none  believe.    Thou  ne'er  wilt  fulfil  it. 
Swear  to  me  now  with  a  mighty  oath,  great  lord  of  Olympus  ! 
That  on  this  very  day,  a  sov'reign,  born  of  a  woman,  (T°9) 

Of  thy  own  lineage  and  blood  shall  on  earth  appear,  for  dominion 
Destined,  o'er  all  around,  and  nobly  to  rule  o'er  the  Argives.' 
Thus  she  spake.    But  Zeus  perceived  not  the  snare,  nor  escaped  it. 
Forthwith  the  oath  he  swore.    Then  bitterly  rued  he  his  blindness. 
Hera,  delighted,  shot  from  the  rock-piled  heights  of  Olympus. 
Argos  she  sought,  where  pregnant,  she   knew,  was   the  wife   of  its 

sov'reign, 
Sthenelus,  Perseus'  royal  son ;  awaiting  in  patience 
(Now  in  her  seventh  month)  the  approaching  birth  of  her  infant. 
Him,  untimely,  she  pushed  into  life,  but  withheld  from  Alcmena 
All  her  expecled  aid,  and  forbade  th'  Ilythiae  to  help  her; 
Then,  returning  to  Zeus,  she  announced  the  birth  of  his  offspring:  (120) 
'  Lord  of  the  lightning's  blaze !  rejoice  at  the  tidings  I  bring  thee, 


Book  XIX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  423 

This  day  a  hero  is  born  who  shall  rule  o'er  the  dwellers  in  Argos. 
Sthenelus'  son,  Eurystheus,  the  mighty  descendant  of  Perseus, 
And  of  thy  own  immortal  line.     Fit  sov'reign  for  Argos.' 
Pierced    to    the    soul    with    grief  was    Zeus,    when    he    heard    the 

announcement, 
Thus  delivered :  and  Ate  at  once  he  seized  in  his  fury, 
Grasped  by  her  shining  locks:   and  an  oath  he  swore,  that  hence- 
forward 
In  the  Olympian  halls  that  demon  of  strife  and  deception 
Never  should  dwell,  nox  pollute  the  starry  skies  with  her  presence. 
Thus   having   sworn,  from   the   heavenly  heights  and  the  gates  of 
Olympus,  (^o) 

Whirling  her  round,  he  cast  her  down ;  thenceforth  among  mortals 
Ever  to  dwell.   But  the  mischief  was  done,  and  he  grieved  for  Heracles 
When  he  beheld  him  toiling  beneath  the  yoke  of  Euiystheus. 
So  on  my  soul,  the  wrong  I  had  done,  the  mischief  it  wrought  us, 
Weighed,  and  suffered  me  not  to  rest,  while  crest-waving  Hector 
Triumphed,  and  slew  my  Greeks  beneath  the  sterns  of  their  vessels. 
Deeply  I  erred,  by  the  will  of  Zeus  deprived  of  my  reason, 
Yet  will  I  make  amends,  and  with  gifts  proclaim  my  repentance. 
Now  then  for  war  prepare,  and  muster  thy  troops  for  the  battle. 
All  those  gifts  which  yestermorn  Odysseus  on  my  part  (I4°) 

Promised  thee,  home  to  thy  tent  will  I  duly  send,  for  atonement : 
Or,  if  thou  wilt,  restraining  awhile  thy  impatience  for  action, 
Here   on   the  spot  from  my  ships,   by  my  servants  brought,   shalt 

thou  see  them 
Fairly  delivered,  a  pledge  of  my  truth,  and  desire  to  appease  thee." 

Thus  making  answer  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"Atreus'  son,  most  glorious,  thou  king  of  men,  Agamemnon ! 
As  for  the  gifts,  it  rests  with  thyself  to  give  or  withhold  them. 
Equal  it  is  to  me.    Now  prepare  we  at  once  for  the  combat. 
Let  us  not  waste  our  time  in  idle  parley,  delaying 
Aught  that  remains  to  do;  for  a  mighty  work  is  unfinished.     (150) 
Whoso  shall  see  Achilles  once  more  in  front  of  the  battle 
Blazing,  and  sweeping  away  with  his  spear  whole  ranks  of  the  Trojans, 
Fired  with  the  sight,  let  him  close  with  the  foe  and  fight  like  a  hero." 


424  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 

Rising,  here  interposed  the  prudent  and  thoughtful  Odysseus  : 
"Brave  as  thou  art,  Achilles  !  and  likest  a  God  in  the  combat, 
Lead  not,  fasting,  Achaia's  sons  to  fight  with  the  Trojans 
There  before  Ilion's  walls.     No  brief  encounter  or  skirmish 
Then  will  be  seen,  when  two  such  hosts  engaging  in  battle 
Join,  and  encouraging  Gods  inflame  their  mutual  hatred.  (!59) 

Let  then  abundance  of  food  and  wine  at  the  ships  of  the  Grecians 
Hearten  the  troops  for  the  fight :  for  these  give  strength  and  endurance. 
'Tis  not  in  mortal  man  to  confront  the  foe,  and  to  combat, 
Unsupported  by  food  from  dawn  of  day  until  sunset. 
For,  be  he  never  so  brave,  though  his  soul  be  bent  upon  fighting, 
Yet  will  the  time  arrive  when  his  strength  will  fail,  and  his  vitals 
Hunger  and  thirst  will  gnaw,  and  his  knees  refuse  to  sustain  him. 
But  when  a  man,  with  wine  refreshed,  and  with  food  to  support  him, 
Goes  forth  to  meet  his  foe  with  a  day's  hard  fighting  before  him, 
Stout  is  his  heart  in  his  breast.     His  limbs  are  firm,  and  continue 
Strong,  till  the  hour  shall  arrive  when  all  desist  from  the  combat. 
Now  dismiss  the  assembly,  and  give  command  that  our  warriors  (171) 
Take  their  accustomed  meal.     Let  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
Set  forth  the  presents  in  public  view,  that  the  Greeks  may  behold  them, 
Gladding  their  eyes,  and  thyself,  O  Achilles  /  see  and  approve  them ; 
Then  let  him  rise,  and  standing  forth,  in  the  midst  of  the  Argives 
Swear    an    oath    that    he    ne'er    hath    ascended    her    couch,    nor 

approached  her 
After  the  fashion  of  man  and  wife;  thus  clearing  his  honour, 
Placing  thy  mind  at  ease,  and  leaving  no  ground  for  resentme?it. 
Last,  be  a  banquet  served  in  Atreides'  tent,  nor  be  wanting, 
Aught  that  can  shew  respect  for  thy  worth  ox  joy  at  thy  fires e?ice.  (180) 
Thou,  O  Atreides  !  learn  to  be  just  henceforth  in  thy  dealings  : 
Nor  be  ashamed,  nor  regret,  O  king !  to  have  made  reparation, 
Such  as  is  fair  and  just  in  itself,  to  the  man  thou  hast  injured." 

Then  to  Odysseus  replied  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon : 
"Son  of  Laertes  !  gladly  I  hear  each  word  thou  hast  uttered. 
All  thou  hast  said  is  just  and  right,  well  weighed  and  considered. 
What  thou  requir'st  I  am  ready  to  swear.    My  conscience  avows  it, 
Nor  will  I  perjure  myself  in  the  presence  of  God.    Let  Achilles, 


Book  XIX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  425 

Therefore,  consent  to  a  brief  delay,  though  impatient  for  battle. 
All  of  you  here,  my  friends,  remain,  assembled  together,  (190) 

Till   from    my   tents    the    presents    be    brought,   and   our  league  be 

concluded. 
This  be  thy  task,  Odysseus.     To  thee  this  charge  be  entrusted. 
Choose  from  among  the  Grecian  youth  their  noblest  and  bravest, 
Forth  from  our  tents  the  gifts  to  bring  which  we  promised  Achilles 
Yestermorn,  and  the  captive  maids  conduct  to  his  vessels. 
Be  it  Talthybius'  care  a  boar  to  provide  from  the  army, 
Sacrifice  meet  unto  Helios  bright  and  Zeus  the  avenge?-." 

Then  to  his  words  responded  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles  : 
"Atreus'  son,  most  noble  !  tho.u  king  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
All  these  cares  were  better  deferred  to  some  future  occasion,  (200) 
When  in  the  pauses  of  war  some  fitting  season  shall  offer, 
When  the  consuming  rage  which  fills  my  breast  hath  subsided. 
Slaughtered  and  yet  unburied  they  lie  whom  death-dealing  Hector, 
Priamus'  son,  laid  low,  while  Zeus  with  victory  crowned  him. 
And  wouldst  thou  then  persuade  me  to  feast?     My  advice  would 

be  rather, 
Fasting — this  instant — for  all  the  Greeks  to  rush  to  the  combat : 
First  wipe  away  the  stain,  and  avenge  their  fall — then  at  sunset 
Back  triumphant  return,  and  close  the  day  with  a  banquet. 
Me,  till  that  hour,  my  friend  lying  pierced  with  wounds  and  disfigured, 
Stretched  on  his  bier  in  my  tent,  his  feet  to  the  door — his  companions, 
Standing  around  in  sad  and  mournful  array  and  lamenting —      (2I1) 
Meat  nor  drink  shall  refresh,  or  shall  pass  my  lips.     To  my  spirit 
Hateful  are  all  such  thoughts.     I  long  for  nought  but  destruclion, 
Slaughter,  and  wounds  and  blood  and  the  groans  of  perishing  warriors." 

Then  in  his  turn  replied  the  wise  and  careful  Odysseus  : 
'•Glorious  Achilles!  noblest  of  Greeks,  great  Peleus'  offspring." 
Mightier  far  than  my  own  in  fight  I  acknowledge  thy  prowess  j 
Yet  wilt  thou  not  deny  me  the  praise  of  superior  prudence. 
Older  I  am  than  thyself,  instructed  by  longer  experience. 
Let  then  my  words  impress  thy  mind,  and  restrain  thy  impatience.  (220) 
Even  the  bravest  of  men  will  at  length  grow  weary  of  fighting. 
Vast  is  the  swathe  which  the  steel  mows  down  in  the  harvest  of  battle, 


426  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 

Small  is  the  gathered  crop  that  is  saved  alive,  when  the  Thund'rer 
Hangs  forth  his  scales  and  awards  success  to  the  cause  that  he  favours. 
Hard  on  the  Greeks  will  it  be  to  add  hunger  to  grief,  and  with  fasting 
Honour  their  friends,  who  in  heaps  on  heaps  are  perishing  daily. 
That  were  to  leave  no  moment  free  from  hardship  and  suffering. 
Whoso  hath  fall'n,  to  the  tomb  with  pious  care  we  consign  him, 
Sad,  but  with  constant  hearts,  and  a  day  we  give  to  our  sorrows. 
Those  whom  the  wasteful  chances  of  war  shall  spare,  to  support  it  (230) 
Duly  with   meat   and  with    drink   must  in   strength  be  kept,   that, 

unwearied, 
Still  they  may  face  th'  assailing  foe  with  force  unabated, 
Sheathed  in  their  arms  of  stubborn  bronze  for  the  fight.    Let  the  army 
Now,  however  no  further  orders  expect :  for  the  loit'rer 
He  who  awaits  a  second  call  will  find  it  a  sharp  one 
If  at  the  ships  he  linger.     Let  all  be  ready  for  action, 
Down  on  the  Trojans  to  pour,  with  all  the  force  we  can  muster" 
Thus  spake  Odysseus :  and  both  the  sons  of  Nestor  selected, 
Thoas  and  Merion  too,  with  Meges,  Phyleiis'  offspring, 
Creion's  son,  Lycomedes,  he  chose,  and  brave  Melanippus :    (240) 
All  repaired  without  loss  of  time  to  the  tent  of  Atreides. 
Soon  was  their  order  told,  and  at  once  obeyed  by  its  inmates. 
Sev'n  fair  tripods  untouched  by  fire  were  produced  from  its  treasures  ; 
Twenty  refulgent   bowls ;    and   the   twelve    swift   steeds   that   were 

promised  ; 
Forth  came  seven  young  Lesbian  damsels,  fair  and  accomplished; 
Last  Briseis  herself,  the  eighth :  while  noble  Odysseus 
Placed  in  the  scales  ten  talents  of  gold,  and  led  the  procession, 
Followed  by  all  the  rest  of  the  Grecian  youths,  with  the  presents. 
These,    when    arrived,    in    the    midst    they    placed.      Then    great 

Agamemnon, 
Rising,  advanced.    Talthybiu.s  the  herald,  standing  beside  him,    (250) 
Silence  proclaimed  in  impressive  tone,  and  presented  the  victim. 
Then  Agamemnon,  drawing  the  keen  and  glittering  poniard, 
Which  by  the  sheath  of  his  mighty  sword  hung  ever  suspended, 
Cropped  from  the  boar  his  forelock,  and  lifting  his  hands  to  Kronion 
Prayed  :  while  around  the  Greeks,  in  solemn  and  reverent  silence, 


Book  XIX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  427 

Lent  an  attentive  ear  to  each  word  which  fell  from  the  monarch. 

This  was  the  prayer  he  prayed,  his  eyes  upraising  to  heaven  : 

"Witness,  all-pow'rful  Zeus,  thou  first  and  best  of  th'  immortals, 

Earth !  allseeing  Sun  !  and  ye  di-eadful  names  of  the  Furies, 

Ye  who  beneath  the  earth  torment  the  false  and  the  perjured !      (260) 

Hand  of  mine  hath  never  been  laid  on  the  damsel  Briseis. 

Pure  from  approach  or  embrace  of  mine  she  remains  :  nor  dishonour, 

Either  in  word  or  deed,  in  my  tent  hath  ever  assailed  her. 

If  I  be  false  and  forsworn  in  this,  may  the  Gods  in  their  vengeance 

On  my  devoted  head  lay  ev'ry  curse  of  the  perjured." 

Then  in  the  throat  of  the  boar  he  plunged  his  pitiless  dagger : 
Him  Talthybius  whelmed  in  the  hoary  waves  of  the  ocean, 
Rolling  him  down,  a  meal  for  the  fish.     Uprose  then  Achilles, 
And  to  the  warlike  Greeks  these  words  addressed  in  conclusion: 
"Father  Zeus  !  how  dire  are  the  woes  thou  heapest  on  mortals,   (270) 
Ne'er  could  Atreides  thus  have  awakened  wrath  in  my  bosom, 
Nor  had  he  ever,  unprompted,  thus  have  seized  on  the  damsel, 
Carrying  her  off  against  my  will ;  but  that  Zeus  had  determined 
Greece  to  chastise,  and  with  deaths  on  deaths  to  visit  the  Argives  ! 
Now  to  your  meal,  ye  Greeks  :  then  quickly  prepare  for  the  battle." 

Ended  Achilles  his  speech,  and  at  once  dismissed  the  assembly. 
Forthwith  the  Greeks  dispersed,  and  each  to  his  vessel  betook  him. 
Gath'ring  the  costly  gifts,  meanwhile,  the  Myrmidon  warriors 
Bore  them  away,  and  bestowed  them  safe  at  the  ships  of  Achilles. 
Some  they  laid  up  in  the  tents,  there  lodged  the  captives  in  safety, 
While  to  the  stalls  the  noble  attendants  conducted  the  coursers.  (281) 

Beauteous  as  bright  Aphrodite  herself,  the  lovely  Briseis, 
Soon  as  Patroclus,  pierced  with  wounds  she  beheld,  on  his  body 
Flung  herself,  drowned  in  tears,  loud  sobbing,  beating  her  bosom, 
Tearing  her  lovely  neck,  and  defacing  her  beauteous  features. 
Speaking  through  tears,  the  heavenly  fair  gave  vent  to  her  sorrow : 
"Dearest  Patroclus  !  friend,  whose  kindness  soothed  my  affliction  ! 
Mighty  chief!  whom  living  I  left  when  hence  I  departed, 
Now  to  return  to  my  tent,  and  find  thee  slain !    How,  for  ever, 
Evil  on  evil,  grief  upon  grief  pursues  and  o'erwhelms  me !       (290) 
He,  the  betrothed  of  my  love,  whom  my  mother  dear  and  my  father 


428  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 


Gave  to  my  hopes,  in  my  very  sight,  in  defence  of  our  city- 
Fell,    transfixed   with    the    spear;    and    my   brethren    three,    whom 

my  mother 
Bore,  so  dearly  belov'd,  that  day  swept  off  to  destruction. 
Thou,   when    Achilles    had    slain    my   betroth'd,   when   the  home  of 

my  fathers 
Sank,  and  the  city  of  godlike  Mynetes  smoked  in  its  ruins, 
Could'st  not  endure  my  tears,  but  assured  me  that  noble  Achilles 
One  day  would  make  me  his  bride,  and  across  the  ocean  to  Phthia 
Bear  me,  and  spread  our  nuptial  feast  in  his  Myrmidon  palace. 
Gentle  thou  ever  wert,  and  with  tears  must  I  ever  bewail  thee."  (300) 
Weeping  she  spake.    Then  joined  in  her  moans  the  rest  of  the  captives, 
Each  for  her  own  hard  fate,  though  seeming  to  grieve  for  Patroclus. 

Round  Achilles,  meanwhile,  had  gathered  the  chiefs  of  the  Argives, 
Pressing  him  much  to  their  feast,  but  with  sighs  and  groans  he  resisted ; 
"  Press  me  not,  friends  and  companions  dear,  I  pray,  if  ye  love  me, 
Either  in  food  or  in  cordial  wine  to  seek  for  refreshment : 
Far  too  full  is  my  heart  of  pain  and  grief  to  permit -me. 
Not  till  the  sun  shall  have  set  will  I  break  my  fast, — but  endure  it." 
Thus  he  spake  :  and  the  rest  of  the  chiefs  from  his  presence  departed. 
Only  the  two  Atreidas  remained,  and  noble  Odysseus,  (3IQ) 

Nestor,  the  monarch  of  Crete,  and  that  ancient  warrior,  Phoenix. 
These  to  console  him  essayed,  but  his  soul  refused  consolation;. 
That  must  he  seek  in  the  bloody  abyss  of  war  and  destruction. 
Stung  with  renewed  regrets,  oft  groaning,  thus  he  lamented : 

"  This  would  have  been  thy  care,  Unhappy !     My  loved  and  my 

lost  One  ! 
Thou  wouldst  thyself  have  set  before  me  abundant  refreshment 
Here  in  my  tent,  in  haste,  but  with  care  prepared,  when  the  Grecians 
Set  forth  in  battle  array  to  contend  with  the  horse-taming  Trojans. 
There  however  thou  liest,  in  wounds  and  in  death  :  and  my  spirit 
Loathes  the  refreshment  of  meat  or  drink  from  our  ample  provision,^  20) 
Thinking  of  thee  !     What  heavier  blow,  what  worse  can  befal  me  ? 
Not  should  the  death  be  announced  of  my  old  and  reverend  father, 
Who  at  this  moment  perchance  is  tenderly  weeping  in  Phthia, 
Mourning  the  loss  of  his. son,  who  in  distant  lands  with  the  Trojans 


Book  XIX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  429 

Wages  a  bootless  war,  for  the  cause  of  that  odious  Helen : 
Nor  of  my  glorious  boy  Neoptolemus,  him  whom  in  Scyros, 
(If  he  indeed  still  live)  I  left  in  the  care  of  his  teachers, 
Fondly  I  hoped  and  believed  that  I  alone  was  predestined 
Here  on  the  Troian  shore  to  perish,  far  from  Achaia. 
Thou   wouldst   return   to    Phthia,    methought;     thence    passing    to 
Scyros,  (330) 

Bring  back  my  son  once  more  in  thy  sable  ship  to  his  country. 
There  wouldst  thou  make  him  acquainted  with  all  his  father's  posses- 
sions, 
All  my  domains,  my  slaves,  and  the  high-roofed  halls  of  my  palace. 
Peleus  now,  methinks,  must  be  long  since  dead,  or  if  living, 
Barely  alive  at  best,  and  dragging  a  painful  existence, 
Worn  out  with  age  and  grief,  and  hourly  awaiting  the  tidings, 
Harder  to  bear  than  his  own,  of  the  mournful  fate  of  his  offspring." 

Weeping  he  spake,  and  the  princes  around  him  joined  in  his  sorrows, 
Each  lamenting  those  he  had  left  at  home  in  his  palace. 
Zeus  from  above  looking  down  beheld  and  pitied  their  anguish,    (340) 
And  from  his  throne  where  he  sate  addressed  these  words  to  Athene  : 
"  Why  dost  thou,  my  daughter !   forsake  thy  favourite  hero  ? 
Has  then  Achilles  quite  dropped  out  from  thy  thoughts  and  remem- 
brance ? 
Lo !  where  weeping  he  sits  by  the  lofty  stems  of  his  vessels, 
Mourning  his  dear  companion  lost.     The  rest  of  the  Grecians 
All  are  recruiting  their  strength  with  food.     He  thirsts  and  is  fasting. 
Go  then  !  ambrosia's  heav'nly  food  and  the  juice  of  our  nectar 
Into  his  bosom  instil,  lest  hunger  and  thirst  overcome  him." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  Athena,  no  prompting  needing,  obeyed  him. 
Down  from  Olympus  she  sprang,  and  clove  the  air,  like  a  harpy  (350) 
Screaming  in  voice  and  broad  of  wing :   and  she   came  where  the 

Grecians, 
Aiming,  prepared  for  battle  throughout  their  host :  and  with  nectar, 
And  with  ambrosia  rich,  diffused  through  the  frame  of  her  hero, 
Chased  away  hunger  and  thirst,  and  confirmed  his  strength  for  the 

conflict. 
This  performed,  she  returned  to  the  stately  dome  of  her  Parent, 


430  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 

While  from  their  sable  ships  the  Greeks  poured  forth  to  the  combat. 
As  when  the  fast  falling  snow  flies  thick  from  the  hand  of  Kronion, 
Drifted  along  by  the  cold  and  sweeping  blast  of  the  north  wind, 
Thus  o'er  the  field  in  thick'ning  swarms  poured  forth  from  the  vessels 
Bright    gleaming    helmets,    high-bossed    shields,    and    deep-moulded 

corslets,  (360) 

Fitted  to  manly  chests,  and  stout  ash  spears  that  a  splendour 
Shot  to  the  sky :  while  the  very  ground  seemed  laughing  with  flashes, 
Lightening  around  from  their  arms;   and  beneath  the  trampling  of 

heroes 
Echoed.     Achilles  his  arms  assumed  in  the  midst  of  his  warriors, 
Grinding   his   teeth   with  rage ;  while   his  burning  eyes  from  their 

sockets 
Glared,  like  a  flame,  and  within  his  heart  unendurable  anguish 
Reigned  supreme,  with  fierce  revenge  and  hate  for  the  Trojans, 
While  in  those  glorious  arms  he  arrayed  him,  gifts  of  Hephaestus. 
First  round  his  manly  legs  the  rich  wrought  greaves  he  adjusted, 
Beauteous,  with  silver  hasps,  and  with  clasping  buckles  of  silver ;  (370) 
Next  o'er  his  bosom  he  braced  his  bright  and  glittering  corslet; 
Slung  o'er  his  shoulder  his  sword  of  bronze,  all  studded  with  silver ; 
Slung  too  ready  for  use  his  broad  and  ponderous  buckler, 
Flinging  its  beams  afar,  like  the  moon  new  rising  in  glory. 
As  when  to  weary  and  storm-tossed  sailors,  far  on  the  ocean, 
Streams  forth  a  light  from  some  lone  watch-tow'r  high  on  a  mountain, 
Longing  they  view  the  blaze  of  its  friendly  fires,  but  the  tempest 
Sweeps  them  reluctant  away  to  sea,  despairing  of  succour: 
So  to  the  skies  from  the  bright  and  rich-wrought  shield  of  Achilles 
Streamed  the  long  rays  of  light.     On  his  head  then  placed  he  the 

helmet,  (380) 

Weighty  and  strong  of  proof.     Like  a  star  which  sparkles  in  splendour 
Glittered  the  crested  casque ;  and  the  golden  threads  by  Hephaestus 
Mixed  with  its  plume  waved  wide  from  the  tow'ring  crest  as  it  nodded. 
Then  for  the  first  time  tried  he  the  arms,  and  tested  their  fitting. 
All  was  complete,  and  his  godlike  limbs  moved  freely  within  them, 
Buoyant  and  supple.     Like  wings  they  seemed  to  sustain  and  to  lift 

him. 


Book  XIX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  431 

Then  from  its  case  he  took  the  spear  that  his  father  had  wielded, 
Stubborn  it  was,  and  huge,  and  pond'rous.     Saving  Achilles 
None  among  all  the  Greeks  might  avail  that  weapon  to  brandish ; 
Formed  from  an  ash  on  Pelion's  summit  hewn,  and  by  Chiron     (390) 
Giv'n  to  his  father,  to  work  the  death  of  many  a  hero. 

Alcimus  now  and  Automedon  led  forth  the  steeds,  and  their  collars 
Beauteous  adjusted  beneath  the  yoke,  and  with  curb  and  with  bridle 
Bitted  their  foaming  jaws  ;  then  led  back  the  reins  to  the  chariot 
Over  its  polished  rim :   and  in  haste  Automedon  mounted, 
Flourishing  high  the  scourge  in  his  practised  hand;  and  Achilles 
Now  for  the  battle  completely  arrayed,  behind  him  ascended, 
Gleaming  in  arms  like  the  all-illumining  sun  in  his  splendour. 
Thus  then  in  accents  fierce  he  chid  the  steeds  of  his  father  : 
"  Xanthus  and  Balius  !  noble  steeds  of  the  strain  of  Podargus  !    (400) 
Safer  and  better  to-day  be  your  task  performed  j  and  your  master 
Back  to  the  camp  in  triumph  borne :   nor  leave  him  behind  you 
Lifeless  stretched  on  the  field,  as  ye  .left  unhappy  Patroclus." 

Then  from  beneath  the  yoke  thus  Xanthus,  his  swift-footed  courser, 
Spake ;   while   his   head  drooped  low,   and  his  flowing  mane  from 

the  collar, 
Downward,  escaping,  trailed  in  the  dust,  all  loose  and  dishevelled 
(Language  and  power  of  speech  by  the  white-armed  Hera  were  giv'n 

him)  : 
"  Mighty  Achilles  !    safe  this  day  will  we  bear  thee  from  battle, 
Yet  is  thy  destined  hour  at  hand,  nor  aught  to  avert  it  (40 9) 

All  we  can  do  may  avail.     Stern  fate  and  the  Gods  have  ordained  it, 
'Twas  by  no  fault  of  ours,  no  want  of  speed  or  of  vigour, 
Glorious  Patroclus  fell,  and  the  Trojans  stripped  off  his  armour. 
He,  the  most  mighty  God,  the  offspring  of  fair-haired  Latona, 
Smote  him,  in  front  of  the  battle,  and  gave  the  glory  to  Heel  or. 
What  though  fleet  as  the  Zephyr's  blast  we  bear  thee  (and  fleeter 
Nought  hath  the  thought  of  man  conceived)  thy  fate  is  decided  : 
Low   shalt  thou  lie,  struck   down   by  the  hands  of    a  God  and  a 
mortal." 

Such  were  his  words.     All  further  speech  the  furies  denied  him. 
Mighty  Achilles,  much  disturbed,  returned  him  for  answer : 


432  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XIX. 

"Xanthus!   Why  predict  what  already  I  know  ?   That  in  Troia  (420) 
Here  I  am  destined  to  fall,  there  needed  not  thee  to  inform  me. 
Far  from  my  father  and  mother,  their  son  must  die.     But  I  shun  not 
Death:  as  full  many  a  Trojan  shall  learn  to  his  cost  ere  I  perish." 
Thus  having   said,  with  a    shout   he   urged   on  the    steeds   to   the 
battle.

T^HUS,  pouring  forth  from  their  ships,  the  Greeks,  insatiate  of  battle, 
■*~    Gathered  around  thee  in  arms,  O  mighty  descendant  of  Peleus ; 
While  on  the  slope  o'erlooking  the  plain  stood  mustered  the  Trojans. 
Zeus  from  the  loftiest  peak  of  the  many-cloven  Olympus 
Themis  had  now  dispatched  to  call  the  Gods  to  a  council. 
Forth  she  went,  and  summoned  them  all  to  the  halls  of  their  sov'reign. 
Saving  Oceanus,  all  the  presiding  gods  of  the  rivers, 
Nymphs,  one  and  all,  whose  haunts  are  the  pleasant  groves  and  the 

fountains, 
Wide  watered  plains  and  grassy  meads,  drew  nigh  at  her  bidding. 
These  in  the  palace  of  cloud-compelling  Zeus  when  assembled       (10) 
Ranged  themselves  on  the  polished  and  marble  seats  by  Hephaestus 
Framed  with  consummate  skill  to  adorn  the  celestial  mansion. 
Nor  did  the  great  earth-shaking  God  refuse  his  attendance. 
Forth  from  his  waves  ascending  he  came,  a?id  joined  the  assembly, 
Where,  in  the  midst  uprising,  he  spake,  and  questioned  the  Thund'rer : 
"  Lord   of  the  lightning's  blaze,    say !   why  hast  thou  called   us  to- 
gether ? 
Dost  thou  contemplate  aught  that  regards  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans, 
Now  on  the  very  verge  of  a  fierce  and  fiery  conflict  ?" 

Thus  he  questioned,  and  thus  the  cloud-compeller  responded  : 
"  Mighty  Poseidon  !  well  thou  divin'st  the  thoughts  of  my  bosom  ! 


436  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

'Tis  for  their  sake  I  convoke  you.     Their  death  is  doomed.     Yet  I 
love  them.  (21) 

Here  will  I  sit,   remote  on  the  rugged  height  of  Olympus, 
Calm,  and  surveying  all  in  my  bliss.     But   do   ye  as  it  lists  you ; 
Joining  with  either  host  assist  the  Greeks,  or  the  Trojans, 
Just  as  ye  feel  disposed  to  side  with  one  or  the  other; 
For  should  Achilles  alone  be  allowed  to  contend  with  the  Trojans, 
Hardly  their  force  would  sustain  Peleides'  attack  for  a  moment. 
Ever  before  they  viewed  him  with  dread,  and  shrank  from  his  onset ; 
Now  when  he  comes,  inflamed  with  rage  for  the  death  tf/"his  comrade, 
Much  I  dread  lest,  in  spite  of  fate,  he  should  capture  the  city."       (30) 
Thus  he  spake,  and  his  words  were  a  signal  for  strife  and  contention. 
Up  rose  the  Gods,  taking  opposite  sides,  and  joined  in  the  contest. 
Hera  first  sought  the  Grecian  ships,  with  Pallas  Athene, 
Mighty  Poseidon  too,  the  dread  earth-shaker,  and  Hermes, 
Deft  of  hand,  and  ready  of  wit,  contriving  and  prudent. 
Thither  Hephaestus  dragged  his  distorted  feet,  as  he  followed 
Shuffling  along  with  pain,  and  an  angry  scowl  on  his  features. 
Ares,  the  crested  God  of  war,  befriended  the  Trojans ; 
Phoebus,  his  locks  unshorn,  with  Latona  joined,  and  the  huntress 
Artemis ;  Xanthus  too,  and  the  queen  of  smiles,  Aphrodite.  (40) 

Long  as  the  Deities  kept  aloof,  nor  mixed  with  the  armies, 
So  long  rejoiced  and  triumphed  the  Greeks,  when  they  saw  that  Achilles 
Fought  once  more  on  their  side,  who  long  had  abstained  from  the 

contest. 
So  long  too  did  a  panic  of  fear  disable  the  Trojans, 
Crippling  their  strength,  when  they  saw  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles 
Shining  conspicuous  in  arms,  like  the  form  of  death-dealing  Ares. 
Soon  as  however  the  Gods  appeared  and  mixed  with  the  armies, 
Suddenly  fierce  contention  arose  and  stirred  up  the  nations. 
Now  from  the  trench  and  the  wall  was  heard  the  shout  of  Athene, 
Now  from  the  sounding  shore,  and  among  the  ships  it  re-echoed.     (50) 
Answering  shout  for  shout,  with  the  thundring  roar  of  the  tempest 
Ares  was  heard  exciting  the  Trojans  :  now  from  their  ramparts, 
Now  along  Simois'  bank,  and  the  heights  of  Callicolone. 

Thus  while  on  either  side  the  blessed  Gods,  intermingling, 


Book  XX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  437 

Cheered  on  the  troops  and  aroused  them  to  deadly  strife  and  conten- 
tion. 
High  o'er  their  heads  the  Father  of  Gods  and  mortals  his  thunder 
Roll'd  terrific.     Beneath  their  feet  rock-rending   Poseidon 
Smote  with  his  trident  the  boundless  earth,  and  the  mountains  were 

shaken  ; 
Many-rilled  Ida  quivered  through  all  her  roots,  and  her  summits 
Rocked  to  and  fro,  and  the  tow'rs  of  Troy,  and  the  ships  of  the  Gre- 
cians. (60) 
Down  in  the  nethermost  deep,  hell's  gloomy  king,  Ai'doneus, 
Sprang  from  his  throne  with  a  cry  of  wild  alarm ;  for  he  dreaded 
Lest  at  another  such  shock  the  earth  should  open  above  him 
Yawning,  and  Gods  and  men  should  behold  those  horrible  mansions, 
Dismal,  loathsome,  and  dark,  by  the  Gods  all  held  in  abhorrence. 
Such,  when  the  Gods  in   conflict   joined,  was  the  crash   of  their 
meeting. 
There  might  be  seen,  opposed  to  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon, 
Phoebus  Apollo,  with   winged  shaft,   with    bow   ana7  with  quiver ; 
Ares,  impetuous  pow'r,  stood  matched  with  Pallas  Athene' ; 
Artemis,  huntress  Queen  of  the  woods,  fair  sister  of  Phoebus,           (70) 
Bearing  her  darts  and  golden  bow,  was  confronted  with  Here' ; 
Hermes,  the  saviour  in  danger,  advanced  to  contend  with  Latona  ; 
And  with  Hephaestus  the  mighty  stream,  with  its  eddying  whirlpools, 
Xanthus  called  by  the  Gods  above,  by  mortals  Scamander. 

Thus  stood  Gods  against  Gods  in  arms  arrayed,  but  Achilles 
Only  on  Hector  fixed  his  thoughts,  much  longing  to  meet  him, 
Burst  through  opposing  ranks,  and,  singling  him  out  for  his  victim, 
Pour  forth  his  blood,  to  glut  the  rage  of  insatiate  Ares. 
Phoebus  however,  approachi?ig  ^Eneas,  pressed  him  to  action, 
Rousing  his  courage,  and  urging  him  on  to  encounter  Achilles,       (80) 
Taking  the  features  and  voice  of  Lycaon.  offspring  of  Priam. 
Shrouding  his  heavnly  form  in  human  shape,  he  addressed  him  : 
"  AVhere  are  thy  threats,  most  valiant  .Eneas,  chief  of  the  Trojans, 
Uttered  so  bravely  in  deep   carouse  with  the  princes  of  Troia, 
That   with   Achilles'    might    thou   wouldst   match  thine  own  in   the 
combat?" 


438  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

Thus  to  the  God's  address  in  turn  responded  ^Eneas : 
"  Why  wouldst  thou  urge  me,  O  son  of  Priam,  to  fight  with  Achilles  ? 
Well  may  I  feel  reluctant  to  meet  so  mighty  a  warrior. 
Not  for  the  first  time  now  should  I  stand  opposed  to  his  prowess. 
Once  before  (I  eon/ess  it)  I  fled  from  his  spear,  when  on  Ida,  (90) 

Sweeping  away  our  flocks  and  herds,  he  descended,  and  captured 
Lofty  Lyrnessus  and  Pedasusy^/r.     'Twas  then  that  to  save  me 
Zeus  interposed,  and  swiftness  bestowed,  and  strength,  to  escape  him  : 
Else  had  I  perished  beneath  his  destroying  hand,  and  Athena's, 
Who  in  the  light  of  glory  and  fame  led  him  onward,  subduing 
Under  his  conquering  spear  Lelegaea's  warriors  and  Troia's  : 
Nor  is  it  given  to  mortal  man  to  contend  with  Achilles; 
Ever  some  God  attends  his  steps,  and  secures  him  from  danger. 
Sharp  and  sure  his  lance  flies  swift  to  its  mark ;  and  to  stay  it 
Nought  can  avail  till  it  quivers  in  human  flesh.     Yet  impartial    (100) 
Were  but  the  Gods — would  they  give  me  an  equal  chance — he  should 

find  me 
Hard  -to  subdue.     Were  he  strong  as  a  brazen  tow'r,  L  would  meet 

him." 
Then  spake  Apollo,  son  of  Zeus,  and  this  was  his  answer : 
"  Seek  for  thyself  by  prayer  the  aid  of  the  blessed  immortals. 
If,  as   men   say,   thou   deriv'st  thy  birth  from  bright  Aphrodite, 
Daughter  of  Zeus, — He  springs  from  a  far  inferior  lineage ; 
Thou  from  Almighty  Zeus — He  but  from  the  loins  of  a  Sea-God. 
Hero  and  Prince  as  thou  art,  let  him  feel  thy  spear,  nor  allow  him 
Either  by  vaunts  or  threats  to  turn  thee  aside  from  thy  purpose." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  Prince's  heart  dilated  with  courage  )        (1 10) 
Sheathed  in  refulgent  brass  he  rushed  to  the  front  of  the  battle. 

Not  unperceived  by  fair-armed  Hera,  the  son  of  Anchises 
Pushed  through  the  crowded  ranks,  to  contend  in  arms  with  Peleides. 
Calling  together  the  friendly  Pow'rs,  then  thus  she  addressed  them : 
"  Worthy  of  all  your  attention  and  thought,  Poseidon  and  Pallas, 
Is  the  bold  deed  which  now  yon   Trojan  chief  is  performing. 
Lo  !  where  ^Eneas,  sheathed  in  refulgent  armour,  advances 
Strong  in  Apollo's  support,  to  dare  the  force  of  Achilles. 
Say  !    shall  we  intercept  and  turn  him  back  from  his  purpose  ? 


Book  XX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  439 

Surely  at  least  some  friendly  God  should  stand  by  Achilles,  (I2°) 

Giving  him  strength,  and  tilling  his  heart  with  courage  and  vigour, 
So  that  he  fail  not,  and  learn  that  the  mightiest  pow'rs  of  Olympus 
Favour  his  cause  :  that  vain  is  the  force  of  the  Gods  that  oppose  him; 
Fruitless  all  their  attempts  to  save  proud  Troy  from  destruction. 
Give  him  to  know  that  we  all  have  come  to  support  and  to  aid  him 
Down   from   Olympus'   heights,   and   to   hold  him   secure  from  the 

Trojans 
This  day  at  least.     Hereafter,  the  ills  by  fate  interwoven 
Into  his  thread  of  life,  at  the  hour  of  his  birth,  will  o'ertake  him. 
This,  if  some  heav'nly  voice  reveal  not  now  to  Achilles,  (129) 

Dread  on  his  spirit  will  fall,  should  he  meet  some  God  in  the  battle. 
Ever  to  mortal  eyes  is  the  sight  of  a  God  overpow'ring." 

Thus  then  in  turn  responded  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon : 
••  Why  should  such  troublous  thoughts  disturb  thy  spirit,  O  Here'? 
Scarcely,  methinks,  is  it  time  for  us  to  engage  in  their  quarrel ; 
Calm  in  superior  might  can  we  view  the  scene  of  contention. 
Let  us  withdraw,  and  apart,  from  some  fitting  station,  observe  them, 
TJiere  on  yon  lofty  mound  :  and  be  war  the  employment  of  mortals. 
But  should  or  Ares  commence  the  fight,  or  Phcebus  Apollo, 
Should  they  obstruct  Achilles"  course,  or  hinder  his  pro^  —  • 
Then  will  we  interpose  our  might,  and  in  bitter  contention     (140) 
Gods   against  Gods  shall  strive.     Full  soon  will  we    drive  them  be- 
fore us 
Back  to  Olympus,  there  to  rejoin  the  celestial  conclave. 
Forced  to  relinquish  the  fray,  and  resign  the  field  to  the  stro&gt; 

Thus  spake  the  azure  God,  and  led  the  way  to  the  rampart 
Raised   round   the   mound   which   had   sheltered   erst   the   god-like 

Heracles, 
Reared  in  the  olden  time  by  the  Trojans  and  Pallas  Athene, 
Safe  retreat  and  defence  to  afford  him,  chased  by  the  monster 
Sea-born  and  fierce  which  swept  the  coast  and  ravaged  the  country. 
Seated  on  this,  Poseidon  and  all  the  Gods  were  assembled 
Friendly  to  Greece,  and  a  veil  of  cloud  fell  densely  around  them.     (150) 
Those  on  the  other  side,  on  the  heights  of  Callicolone', 
Gathered  round  Ares,  subverter  of  states,  and  Phcebus  Apollo. 


440  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

Thus  upon  either  hand  they  sate,  debating  in  council, 
Loth  to  commence  their  struggle,  and  plunge  in  mutual  warfare, 
While  from  on  high  the  commands   of  Zeus   re-echoed  in  thunder. 

Filled  was  the  plain  meanwhile  with  assembling  troops,  and  with 
armour 
All  a-blaze,  and  with  chariots  bright ;  and  the  tramp  of  the  footmen 
Shook  the  rebellowing  soil  as  they  marched.     But  foremost  among  them 
Two  of  the  bravest  and  best  of  the  hosts  rushed  forward  to  battle, 
Mighty  ^Eneas,  Anchises'  son,  and  godlike  Achilles.  (I6o) 

Fiercely  threat'ning,  ^Eneas  advanced.     O'er  his  ponderous  helmet 
Nodded  a  lofty  plume,    and  the  mighty  shield  o'er  his  bosom 
Spreading,  he  bore,  with  stalwart  arm,  and  brandished  his  jav'lin. 
Forward  to  meet  him  Peleides  sprang.     In  force  like  a  lion 
Savage  and  strong,  whom  the  herdsmen  all,  each  man  of  the  village 
Eager  to  slay,  assemble.     At  first  disdainfully  scowling 
Onward  he  moves ;  till  grazed  by  the  spear  of  some  vigorous  hunter, 
Then,  for  a  spring  collected,  with  yawning  jaws,  and  with  fury 
Foaming,  his  teeth  displayed,  an  angry  growl  from  his  bosom 
Bursts.     With  alternate  strokes  upon  either  side  as  he  crouches,    (170) 
Lashing  himself  with  his  tail,  he  stirs  up  his  rage  for  the  battle. 
Glaring,  he  darts  on  the  foe,  borne  on  by  his  wrath,  and  desiring 
Only  to  slay,  or  himself  be  slain,  regardless  of  danger. 
Thus  upon  mighty  ^Eneas  at  once  to  rush  and  overwhelm  him 
Prompted  Achilles  his  daring  heart  and  fiery  spirit. 

Now  when  face  to  face  they  advanced,  and  were  nearing  each  other, 
Godlike  Achilles  took  up  the  word  and  addressed  his  opponent : 
"  What  can  have  brought  thee,  yFneas,  so  far  in  advance  of  thy  people? 
Art  thou  in  earnest,  and  really  mean'st  to  fight  with  Achilles  ? 
Hast  thou   the  hope    that,   Priam   dead,    thou    shalt   rule    o'er    the 
Trojans,  (I^o) 

I  being  subdued  ?    For  no  such  exploit,  believe  me,  will  Priam 
Make  thee  his  heir.     He  has  sons ;  and  firm,  not  weak,  is  his  temper. 
Or  have  the  Trojans,  perchance,  to  reward  so  glorious  a  conquest 
Promised  thee  some  vast  tract  of  land,  some  mighty  possession, 
Vineyard  and  arable  fair  and  rich,  inviting  thy  culture, 
But  on  that  one  condition — which  hard  thou  mayst  find  to  accomplish? 


Book  XX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  441 

Once  ere  this  have  I  seen  thee  in  headlong  flight  from  my  jav'lin. 
Hast  thou  forgot  how,  thy  cattle  abandoned,  Ida  beheld  thee 
Down  from  her  slopes  careering  with  nimble  feet,  when  I  followed 
Fast  on  thy  lonely  steps,  and  thou  look'd'st  not  back  in  thy  terror 
E'en  to  Lyrnessus  thou  fledst.     Pursuing,  I  captured  the  city,      (191) 
Laying  it  utterly  waste,  by  the  aid  of  Zeus  and  Athene. 
Many  a  matron  and  maid,  deprived  of  the  light  of  her  freedom, 
Captive  I  carried  away.     Thee  Zeus  and  the  other  immortals 
Saved ;  which  again  this  day  they  will  hardly  do,  as  thou  dreamest 
Fondly.    Now  be  advised.    Retreat,  and  among  thy  companions 
Shrink,  and  be  lost  in  the  crowd,  lest  evil  and  mischief  befall  thee. 
Warning  the  wise  receive.     Mishap  is  the  teacher  of  folly." 

Thus  Peleides.    Then  in  his  turn  responded  yEneas  : 
"Think  not,  Peleides,  thus  like  a  child  with  words  to  affright  me.  (200) 
Easy  it  were  to  reply,  could  I  stoop  to  utter  revilings, 
Scoff  to  return  for  scoff,  and  reproaches  unworthy  of  heroes. 
Known  are  our  parents :  known  unto  each  the  descent  of  the  other, 
Long  established  by  public  fame  and  received  among  all  men. 
What   though   the   parents  of  each  may  ne'er  have  been  seen  by 

the  other, 
Yet  art  thou  known  to  all  as  the  son  of  illustrious  Peleus, 
Thetis  thy  mother  divine,  the  fair-haired  nymph  of  the  ocean. 
Proud  of  my  birth,  I  stand  as  the  offspring  of  glorious  Anchises, 
And  of  a  niatchless  mother,  the  daughter  of  Zeus,  Aphrodite.      (209) 
One  or  the  other  of  these  must  this  day  weep  for  her  offspring : 
For  be  assured,  not  with  words  alone  or  childish  reproaches 
Part  we  from  hence,  or  thus  decide  the  quarrel  between  us. 
But  wouldst  thou   learn  from   its   earliest  source  my  race  and  my 

lineage, 
List  to  the  tale  which  a  world-wide  fame  hath  spread  through  the 

nations. 
Dardanus,  first  of  our  race,  from  cloud-compelling  Kronion 
Sprang,  and  Dardania  built :   for  the  sacred  city  of  Ilion 
Rose  not  as  yet  in  the  plain,  nor  could  boast  its  nation  and  language. 
Only  the  sloping  skirts  of  the  fountful  Ida  were  peopled. 
Dardanus  dead,  Ericthonius  his  son  came  next  in  succession,       (219) 


442  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

Famed  throughout  all  the  neighbouring  states  as  the  wealthiest  of  mortals ; 
Cropping  the  marshy  meads  three  thousand  mares  in  his  pastures 
Roamed,  each  suckling  a  tender  foal  that  gambolled  beside  her. 
Boreas  himself,  in  wanton  mood  in  the  form  of  a  courser, 
Tossing  his  dark  and  flowing  mane,  intermingled  among  them. 
Thence  were  produced  twelve  wond'rous  foals,  surpassing  in  swiftness, 
Which,  when   they  bounded   along   in   the   fertile   plains,    o'er   the 

corn-ears 
Passed,  and  beneath  their  feet  the  stalks  but  bent  and  recovered  : 
Or,  as  they  lightly  skimmed  o'er  the  broad  expanse  of  the  ocean, 
Bird-like,  their  glancing  feet  the  waves  but  touched  and  disturbed  not. 
Tros  from  great  Ericlhonius  sprang,  first  king  of  the  Trojans.       (230) 
Thence  in  the  next  descent  arose  three  glorious  princes, 
Ilus,  Assaracus  bold,  and  the  godlike  in  form,  Ganymedes, 
All  who  have  e'er  been  born  on  earth  surpassing  in  beauty ; 
Whom  for  his  beauty  and  grace  the  Gods  caught  up  to  Olympus 
All  their  feasts  to  attend,  a?id  to  hand  the  cup  to  their  sov'reign. 
Ilus  Laomedon  next  begat,  the  renowned  and  the  blameless. 
Five  were  the  sons  to  Laomedon  born :  Tithonus  and  Priam, 
Clytius,  Lampus,  and  brave  Hicetaon,  scion  of  Ares. 
While  from  Assaracus  Capys  sprang,  whose  son  was  Anchises. 
I  to  Anchises  owe  my  birth,  and  Heel; or  to  Priam.  (240) 

Thus  have  I  traced  my  descent  through  a  line  of  gods  and  of  heroes. 
Zeus  however  to  man  grants  strength  and  pow'r  as  it  lists  him, 
Ever  supreme,  exalting  one,  and  abasing  another. 
Why  do  we  stand,  howbeit  in  the  midst  of  the  battle,  inactive, 
Talking,  like  idle  boys,  while  heroes  are  fighting  around  us  ? 
Endless  is  mutual  abuse,  and  a  load  of  bitter  invective, 
Such  as  a  hundred-oared  galley  would  freight,  were  easy  to  utter. 
Words  from  the  voluble  tongues  of  men  roll  forth  in  abundance, 
Various  in  phrase,  and  tossed  abroad  fly  hither  and  thither. 
Such  as  thou  speak'st  thou  shalt  hear  in  reply,  returned  thee  with 

infrest.  (250) 

Where  is  the  need  that  we  two  should  stand,  reviling  each  other, 
Bandying  scoffs  and  taunts,  like  angry  women  disputing ; 
Who,  when  they  meet  in  the  street,  give  vent  to  their  passion,  and  utter 


Book  XX.J  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  443 

All  that  occurs,  be  it  true  or  false  ?  for  both  one  and  the  other 
Rage  and  despite  alike  suggest  in  the  heat  of  contention. 
Not  then  by  words,  be  sure,  shalt  thou  turn  me  aside  or  affright  me. 
First  must  we  fight  it  out.     Come  on  then  !    Now  let  our  jav'lins 
Bring  to  an  issue  sharp  and  swift  the  quarrel  between  us." 

Ending,  his  brazen  spear  he  hurled,  which  full  on  his  buckler, 
Broad  and  tremendous,  alighting,  smote,  and  sharply  resounded,  (260) 
Holding  it  off  with  his  arm  Peleides  shrank  from  the  weapon, 
Somewhat  alarmed  :  for  a  spear  thus  hurled  from  the  hand  of  ^neas 
Easily   might,    he    thought,    have    transfixed    the    shield   and  have 

reached  him. 
Faithless  !    His  inmost  heart  might  have  taught  him  a  surer  reliance 
On  the  celestial  gift  of  so  great  a  god,  by  a  mortal 
Not  to  be  proved,  at  the  first  assault,  abortive  and  worthless. 
Pow'rless  to  pierce  that  mighty  shield,  the  spear  of  ^Eneas 
Smote  on  its  golden  orb  :  but  the  gift  of  Hephaestus  resisted. 
Two  of  its  plates  it  pierced ;  but  three  were  behind  to  repel  it. 
Five  had  the  limping  god  combined  to  strengthen  the  buckler:        (270) 
Two,  the  outer,  of  brass;  two  of  tin  within;  and  between  them; 
Gold  in  the  midst,  where  the  lance  stuck  fast,  unable  to  pierce  it. 
Then  from  Peleides'  hand  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin 
Flew,  and  it  smote  on  the  smooth  round  orb  of  the  shield  of  /Eneas, 
Close  to  its  outer  rim,  where  the  bronze  was  thin,  and  the  bull's-hide 
Thinly  o'erlaid  its  frame.     And  through  all  the  plates  of  its  structure 
Burst  the  great  Pelian  ash,  and  splintered  the  shield  in  its  passage. 
Crouching,  ^Eneas  avoided  the  death,  uprearing  the  buckler, 
Struck  with  deadly  alarm  :  for  the  spear,  unchecked  and  impetuous, 
Over  his  back  held  on  its  course,  and,  quivering,  behind  him         (280) 
Fixed  in  the  ground,  deep-rooted.    ./Eneas,  escaped  from  the  weapon, 
Stood  for  a  moment,  his  eyes  o'erspread  with  darkness  and  horror, 
Thus  to  have  felt  his  fate  so  near.     On  rushed  then  Achilles, 
Raising  a  dreadful  cry,  and  his  keen  sword  drew  from  its  scabbard, 
Eager  to  slay  him.    ^Eneas  stooped,  and  uplifted  a  boulder 
Weighty  and  huge,  which  two  strong  men  could  hardly  have  carried 
(Men  such  as  now  we  behold) :  yet  with  ease  he  lifted  and  poised  it. 
Then  on  Peleides'  helm  had  the  thundering  ruin  descended, 


444  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

Or  on  his  shield,  whose  strength  would  have  saved  its   lord  from 

destruction, 
And  from  Achilles,  closing  upon  him,  his  fate  had  been  certain,  (290) 
Had  not  the  watchful  eyes  of  earth-shaking  Poseidon  beheld  it, 
Who  to  the  gods  around  addressed  these  words  in  his  favour : 
"Grieved  is  my  soul  to  behold  the  danger  of  noble  ^Eneas, 
Who,  to  his  fate  urged  on  by  the  words  of  Phoebus  Apollo, 
Downward  to  Hades  must  pass,  o'erpower'd  by  the  might  of  Achilles. 
Weak  and  misled  !    No  aid  in  the  hour  of  his  need  will  he  lend  him  ! 
Must  then  a  man  so  void  of  offence  himself,  and  so  blameless, 
Suffer  for  others'  crimes ! — one  always  ready  with  off'rings, 
Pleasing  to  Heav'n,  and  to  all  the  gods  who  inhabit  Olympus? 
Then  let  us  haste  to  save  his  life  and  secure  him  from  danger ;  (300) 
Zeus  will  be  sore  displeased  should  he  fall  by  the  hand  of  Achilles  : 
Nor  will  the  fates  themselves  indeed  permit  him  to  perish, 
Or  that  the  great  Dardanian  race  should  fail,  from  a  hero 
Sprung,  among  all  his  sons  whom  Zeus  most  loved  and  regarded, 
Who  to  himself  and  to  mortal  mothers  have  owed  their  existence. 
Now  hath  Kronion  the  cause  and  the  house  of  Priam  abandoned  : 
Henceforth  the  race  of  ^Eneas  is  destined  to  rule  o'er  the  Trojans, 
He,  and  the  sons  of  his  sons,  and  a  long  succession  of  princes." 

Rolling  her  large  majestic  eyes,  thus  Hera  responded  : 
"  Lord    of    the    earthquake's   might !    as    it    lists    thee    deal    with 
./Eneas;  (3TO) 

Snatch  him  from  instant  death  if  thou  wilt,  or  leave   him  to  perish, 
Brave  as  he  is,  by  the  conqu'ring  arm  of  mighty  Achilles. 
Pallas  and  I  stand  bound  by  a  solemn  vow  to  each  other, 
Pledging  ourselves,  by  repeated  oaths,  before  all  the  immortals, 
Never  to  spare  that  hated  race,  or  one  of  the  Trojans 
Save  from  impending  fate  !  though  Troy  should  blaze,  and  in  ashes 
Sink,  when  the  hour  shall  arrive  for  the  warlike  Greeks  to  consume  it." 

This  when  he  heard,  the  great  earth-shaker,  mighty  Poseidon, 
Flew  through  the  fight,  and  amidst  the  ratt'ling  storm  of  the  jav'lins 
Came,    where     ^Eneas     confronted    the     far-famed     offspring     of 
Peleus.  (3  20) 

Straightway  a  darkness  he  poured  o'er  the  eyes  of  godlike  Achilles : 


Book  XX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  445 

Back  through  the  riven  shield  of  the  noble-minded  ^Eneas 
Drew  forth  the  bronze-headed  Pelian  ash,  and  gently  returned  it, 
Laying  the  jav'lin  quietly  down  at  the  feet  of  its  master. 
Lifting  ^Eneas  then  from  the  earth,  away  he  conveyed  him. 
High  over  many  a  rank  of  heroes,  high  o'er  the  chariots 
Sprang,  with  a  bound,  the  chief,  impelled  by  the  might  of  Poseidon. 
Thus,  upborne,  he  arrived  at  the  utmost  verge  of  the  battle, 
Where   in  the  rearmost  ranks    the  Cauconian  host  was  assembled ; 
There,  approaching  him  close,  the  great  earth-shaking  Poseidon 
Thus  in  admonishing  words  addressed  the  son  of  Anchises  :    (331) 
"Which   of  the  Gods,  yEneas !    hath  so  deprived  thee  of  reason 
As  to  persuade  thee  in  single  fight  to  encounter  Achilles, 
Mightier  by  far  than  thyself,  and  more  the  fav'rite  of  Heaven  ? 
Therefore  in  future  be  wise,  and  retreat  whenever  thou  meet'st  him, 
Lest  in  despite  of  fate  thou  descend  to  the  mansions  of  Hades. 
But  when  Achilles  himself  shall  be  slain,  and  his  fate  be  accomplished, 
Then  be  thou  bold,  and  advance  once  more  to  the  front  of  the  battle  : 
None  of  the  Greeks  beside  shall  in  fight  o'ercome  and  despoil  thee." 

Thus,  having  told  him  all,  he  left  him  there  and  departed,         (340) 
And  from  Achilles'  sight  dispelled  the  cloud  that  obscured  it. 
Once  more  clearly  he  viewed  the  field,  and  missed  his  opponent. 
Filled  with  amaze  and  wrath,  then  thus  he  communed  with  his  spirit : 
"Gods  !  what  a  marvel  greets  my  sight !  what  wonder  has  happened? 
Here  I  behold  before  me  my  spear  on  the  ground,  and  the  foeman, 
He  against  whom  I  hurled  it,  and  thought  to  have  slain  him,  hath  van- 
ished. 
Doubtless  ^Eneas  too  is  beloved  by  the  blessed  immortals, 
Empty  and  vain  as  I  thought  those  vaunting  boasts  that  he  lettered! 
Well !  let  him  go.     He  will  hardly  seek  such  another  encounter, 
Only  too  glad  from  this  to  have  'scaped  with  life  and  in  safety.     (350) 
Now  to  the  work  !  Let  me  first  exhort  our  Danaan  warriors, 
Then  will  I  try  my  strength  against  all  the  rest  of  the  Trojans." 

Thus  he  spake — sprang  back  to  the  ranks — and  encouraged  his 
comrades  : 
"  Hang  not  back,  O  ye  Greeks  !  nor  hold  you  aloof  from  the  Trojans. 
All  of  you,  man  upon  man,  push  forward,  bent  upon  fighting. 


446  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

For,  be  I  ever  so  brave,  too  hard  is  the  task,  unassisted, 
Through  such  a  mass  of  foes  to  break,  and  fight  with  an  army. 
Ares,  immortal  God  though  he  be,  nor  Pallas  Athene 
Through  such  a  gulf  of  war  could  struggle,  and  hew  out  a  passage. 
What  I  can  do  myself,  what  hands  and  strength  can  accomplish,  (360) 
All  shall  be  giv'n  to  Greece  without  reserve,  to  the  utmost. 
Straight  though  their  lines  will  I  break,  and  methinks  not  one  of  the 

Trojans 
Much  will  have   cause  to  rejoice,  who   comes  within  reach  of  my 

weapon." 
Thus  in  inspiriting  words  he  spake.     But  Hector  upbraiding 
Called  on  the  Trojans,  and  pledged  himself  to  encounter  Achilles : 
"  Fear  not  Peleus'  son,  ye  brave  and  generous  Trojans, 
Vaunt  as  he  may.     With  words  I  could  fight  the  blessed  immortals  : 
Not  so  with  sword  and  spear,  for  their  might,  we  know,  is  superior ; 
Nor  will  Achilles,  be  sure,  make  good  the  words  that  he  utters. 
Something  perchance  he  will  do :  but  the  rest  will  remain  unaccom- 
plished. (37°) 
Him,  though  his  arm  were  flame,  will  I  meet  in  deadly  encounter ; 
Aye !  though  his  arm  were  flame,  and  his  strength  as  the  steel  from 
the  furnace. 
Roused  by  his  words,  with  one  accord  the  Trojans  their  jav'lins 
Brandished.     Around  him  on  all  sides  arose  the  roar  of  the  war-cry. 
Phcebus  Apollo  however  by  Hector  stood,  and  addressed  him  : 
" Hector!   beware:   nor  meet  Achilles  in  front  of  the  battle. 
Mixed  with  the  surging  crowd,  in  the  ranks  receive  his  encounter: 
Lest  with  his  spear  he  transfix,  or  strike  thee  down  with  his  falchion." 
Hector,  abashed,  withdrew  when  he  heard  these  words  of  Apollo,  (379) 
Warning  him  thus,  and  mixed  once  more  with  the  mass  of  his  comrades. 
Clothed  in  resistless  courage  and  might,  meanwhile,  on  the  Trojans 
Darted  Achilles,  shouting  a  fearful  shout;  and  Iphition, 
Son  of  Otrynteus,  slew,  brave  chief  of  a  nation  of  warriors. 
Him  to  Otrynteus,  spoiler  of  many  a  city,  a  naiad 
Bore,  where  the  snows  of  Tmolus  impend  o'er  the  pastures  of  Hyda. 
Springing  upon  him  swift  and  fierce,  the  godlike  Achilles 
Smote  with  his  spear  on  his  head,  which  it  cleft  completely  asunder. 


Book  XX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  447 

DoAvn  with  a  crash  he  fell,  while  o'er  him  exulted  Achilles : 
"Lie  thou  there,  Otrynteus'  son  !    most  dreadful  of  mortals. 
Here    hast    thou    found    thy    death,    though    the    distant    lake    of 
Gygaea  (390) 

Witnessed  thy  birth  : — thy  parental  domain  where  fish-teeming  Hyllus 
And  the  deep  eddying  torrent  of  Hermus  mingle  their  waters." 

Thus  Peleides ;   and  darkness  veiled  the  eyes  of  his  victim, 
Whom  underneath  their  chariot- wheels  the  steeds  of  the  Argives 
Crushed  in  their  forward  career.     Demoleon,  son  of  Antenor, 
Stubborn  in  fight  and  a  leader  brave,  he  next  through  the  temple 
Struck.     Through  the  cheek-plate  of  bronze  went  the  spear,  nor  re- 
sisted the  helmet, 
Bronze  as  it  was.    Straight  through  it  the  spear  held  on,  in  its  passage 
Crushing  the  bone  and  mingling  the  brain  with  gore  :  and  Demoleon, 
Brave  though  he  was  and  ardent  of  soul,  sank  down  in  his  death-pang. 
Then    through    Hippodamas'   back   his    spear   he    drove,    from    his 
chariot,  (4QI) 

Just  as  he  leaped ;  in  act  to  fly  from  the  fate  that  pursued  him. 
Roaring  with  pain  he  breathed  forth  his  soul ;  as  haply  may  bellow 
Some  huge  bull,  to  the  shrine  of  the  great  Heliconian  sov'reign 
Dragged  by  attendant  youths,  Poseidon  rejoicing  to  hear  him : 
Such  was  the  roar  when  his  spirit  forsook  the  frame  of  the  hero. 

Next,  to  that  vengeful  spear  a  victim  sank  Polydorus, 
Warned  from  the  fight  in  vain  by  the  care  of  Priam  his  father, 
Youngest  and  best  beloved  of  all  his  sons,  and  among  them 
Godlike  in  feature  and  form,  and  all  surpassing  in  fleetness  ;  (4IG) 

There,  in  the  youthful  pride  of  his  heart,  displaying  his  swiftness, 
Lightly  careering  in  front  of  the  line,  his  fate  overtook  him : 
On  with  his  lance  came  rushing  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles, 
Piercing  him  through  the  back,  where  the  golden-clasps  of  his  girdle 
Joined   in  the  midst;  where,   closing,  o'erlapped   the  plates   of  his 

corslet. 
Forth  through  the  navel  in  front  protruded  the  point  of  the  jav'lin. 
Groaning  he  sank  on  his  knees,  and  a  dark  cloud  hovered  around 

him; 
While  as  he  forward  bowed  his  hands  supported  his  entrails. 


448  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XX. 

Hector  beheld  his  brother  his  dearly  loved  Polydorus, 
Horribly  thus  transfixed,  and  bowed  to  the  ground  in  his  torment.    (420) 
Over  his  eyes  a  darkness  came.     No  longer  endured  he 
Idly  to  stand  aloof,  but  rushed  to  encounter  Achilles, 
Blazing  with  rage  and  shaking  his  deadly  spear.     But  Achilles, 
Soon  as  he  saw  him,  leaped  for  joy;  thus  inly  exclaiming : 
"Here  is  the  man,  at  last,  who  hath  wrung  my  heart  to  the  utmost, 
He  who  mine  honoured  friend  hath  slain.    No  more  from  a  distance 
Each  shall  the  other  behold  across  the  lanes  of  the  battle." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  sternly  regarding  Hector,  addressed  him  : 
"Draw  thou  nigh,  and  receive  thy  death  from  the  hand  of Achilles /" 
Crest-waving  Hector,  undismayed,  this  answer  returned  him  :    (430) 
"Think  not,  Peleides,  thus  like  a  child  with  words  to  affright  me ; 
Easy  it  were  to  reply,  could  I  stoop  to  utter  revilings, 
Or  to  indulge  in  scoffs,  or  reproaches  unworthy  of  heroes. 
Well  do  I  know,  surpassing  my  own,  thy  prowess  and  valour. 
Yet  from  the  Gods  flows  all  success.    By  their  mighty  assistance, 
Hurled  albeit  by  a  feebler  hand,  the  spear  which  I  send  thee 
Haply  may  take  thy  life,  for  its  point  is  piercing  and  tempered." 
Ending,  he  poised  his  spear,  and  dismissed  it  with  force :  but  Athene, 
Breathed  but  a  gentle  breath,  and  wafted  it  far  from  Achilles. 
Back  to  its  godlike  master  the  spear  returned ;  and  he  saw  it,  (440) 
Quietly  laid  on  the  ground  before  his  feet.    But  Achilles, 
Raising  a  dreadful  cry,  rushed  on,  all  eager  to  slay  him. 
That  had  he  done,  but  the  hand  divine  of  Phcebus  Apollo 
Snatched  him  away,  and  poured  thick  mist  and  darkness  around  him. 
Thrice  renewed  his  assault  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles, 
Plunging  his  brazen  spear  in  the  thick  of  the  cloud  :  but  a  fourth  time, 
When,  though  in  strength  like  a  God,  he  vainly  attempted  to  pierce  it, 
Thus  in  impassioned  words  he  vented  his  rage  upon  Hector: 
"Dog!   thou   hast   'scaped   from   death   this    time,   though    near  it 

approached  thee  : 
Phcebus  Apollo,  moved  by  thy  prayers  unceasingly  offered       (450) 
In  the  rude  din  of  arms,  hath  snatched  thee  away  from  destruction. 
Yet  if  there  be  one  god  who  will  stand  my  friend,  I  shall  meet  thee, 
Sooner  or  later,  and  settle  at  length  the  debt  which  I  owe  thee. 


Book  XX.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  449 

Now  on  the  rest  of  the  Trojans  must  fall  the  weight  of  my  vengeance." 
Ending,   Dry  ops  he  pierced  through  the  neck,  in  the   throat,  with 

his  jav'lin, 
Flinging  him  down  at  his  feet  on  the  ground,  and  left  him  to  perish. 
Next  in  the  knee  with  his  lance  Demuchus,  son  of  Philetor, 
Wounded,  a  chieftain  tall  and  brave,  from  flight  he  disabled; 
Then  with  his  mighty  sword  he  rushed  on  his  victim  and  slew  him. 
Dardanus  next  and  Laogonus,  sons  of  Bias,  attacking,  (460) 

Both  he  destroyed — to  the  ground  both  hurled  at  once  from  their 

chariot, 
This  with  his  spear  transfixed,  that  slain  outright  with  his  falchion. 
Tros,  the  son  of  Alastor,  next,  who  suppliant  approached  him, 
Clasping  his  knees,  and  pleading  his  equal  years;  as  a  captive 
Yielding  himself,  and  thinking  to  save  his  life  by  entreaties  : 
Fool  that  he  was  !    he  little  knew  how  deaf  to  persuasion 
That  stern  heart !  how  far  remote  from  aught  that  was  gentle, 
Aught  that  was  tender  and  kind;  when  he  crept  to  his  knees  and 

besought  him, 
Raising  his  hands  in  prayer.    But  Achilles  his  sword  through  his  liver 
Thrust.   Forth  spouted  a  torrent  of  purple  blood,  which  his  bosom  (470) 
Filled,  as  he  fell,  and  eternal  darkness  closed  o'er  his  eyelids. 
Mulius  was  nigh.     Through  his   ear  the  lance  found  entrance  and 

onward, 
Forcing  its  deadly  way  through  his  head,  stood  forth  at  the  other. 
Doiun  on  the  ground  he  sank.    On  Echeclus,  son  of  Agenor, 
Next  fell  the  trenchant  sword,  and  his  skull  was  cleft  to  the  centre. 
Warmed  in  his  brain  was  the  biting  blade,  and  thick  on  his  eyelids 
Rushed  the  impurpled  shadow  of  death,  and  fate  overwhelming. 
Then  through  Deucalion's  arm  his  lance  he  drove,  where  the  tendons 
Down  from  the  elbow  extending  unite  at  the  wrist,  and  disabled: 
Hung  down  the  arm  by  his  side,  a  useless  weight.   He,  expectant,  (480) 
Stood,  confronting  his  death.    With  a  sweep  of\vv$,  sword  then  Achilles 
Lopped  off  his  head  at  once,  and  away  it  rolled  with  his  helmet. 
Forth  from  the   spine  the  marrow  sprang,  and  he   dropped  in  his 

death-pang. 
Then  upon  Rigmus,  Pireus'  son,  the  brave  and  the  blameless,

Who  from  the  fertile  plains  of  Thrace,  in  aid  of  the  Trojans, 
Came  to  the  war,  he  rushed.     Transfixing  the  midst  of  his  bosom, 
Straight  through  his  lungs  the  jav'lin  passed,  and  he  fell  from  his 

chariot. 
Brave  Areithous  his  charioteer,  while  turning  the  horses, 
Struck  through   the  back,  from  the  guideless    car    fell,  startling  the 

coursers. 
As  when  a  fire  invades  some  parched  and  desolate  mountain,  (490) 
Deep  in  its  woody  glens  the  forests  blaze,  and  in  eddies, 
Fanned  by  the  rising  wind,  the  flames  rush  on  and  consume  them  : 
Thus  with  a  more  than  mortal  rage  pursuing  his  victims, 
Flew  round  the  field  Peleides,  his  course  still  marking  with  slaughter  : 
And,  as  the  broad-browed  steers  on  some  well-levell'd  arena, 
Pacing  beneath  their  yoke,  tread  out  the  grain  from  the  barley, 
Easily  crushed  are  the  sheaves  by  the  feet  of  the  bellowing  oxen ; 
Thus  did  his  steeds,  beneath  the  chariot-wheels  of  Achilles, 
Corses  and  shields  in  a  mingled  mass  confound;  and  the  axle 
Trickled  with  blood,  and  the  polished  rim  round  the  seat  of  the 

chariot  (5°°) 

Thick  was  bespattered  with  gore  from  the  trampling  hoofs  of  the  horses, 
And  from  the  whirling  tires.     In  full  career  of  his  glory, 
On  he  rushed,  his  victorious  hands  red  reeking  with  carnage.

Argument. 

The  Trojans,  routed,  divide  into  two  bands,  the  one  flying  towards 
the  city j  the  other,  pursued  by  him,  plunge  into  the  river  Scamander,  into 
which  he  follows  them,  slaying  many,  and  taking  twelve  alive  to  sacrifice 
at  the  funeral  of  Patroclus.  He  then  slays  Lycaon  and  Aster  oficeus.  The 
River  God,  Xanthus,  offended  at  the  slaughter  of  the  Trojans  in  his  stream, 
endeavours  to  overwhelm  him.  Poseidon  and  Pallas  assist  him.  Xanthus 
persists,  and  calls  Simois  to  his  aid,  on  which  Hephaestus,  at  the  command 
of  Hera,  almost  dries  up  the  river.  The  Gods  engage  in  single  combat 
with  each  other.  Achilles  then  drives  the  Troja7is  towards  Troy.  Agenor 
attempts  to  withstand  hi?n.  Apollo  conveys  him  away  in  a  cloud,  and 
assuming  his  form,  leads  Achilles  in  pursuit  away  fro?n  the  city,  giving 
the  Trojaiis  time  to  take  refuge  within  the  walls.

1VT  OW  had  they  reached  at  length  the  banks  of  the  wide-flowing  river 

Xanthus,  sprung  from  immortal  Zeus,  deep  whirling  in  eddies. 
There  were  the  Trojans  divided.     A  part  he  chased  tow'rd  the  city, 
Following  the  upland  slope,  by  the  self-same  way  the  Achaians 
Fled  but  the  day  before  from  the  rage  of  conquering  Hector. 
There  were  they  scattered  in  headlong  flight.     But  Hera  before  them 
Spread  a  bewildering  mist,  their  retreat  to  stay ;  while  the  others, 
Driv'n  to  the  edge  of  the  silver  stream's  deep-eddying  surges, 
Flung  themselves  in  with  uproar  huge.     Hoarse  murmured  the  river: 
Echoed    the    sounding   shores    with    their   cries;    as,   yelling   with 
terror,  (10) 

Hither  and  thither  they  swam,  hard  struggling  for  life  in  the  whirlpools. 
As  when  the  locusts,  driv'n  by  the  force  of  fire,  to  a  river, 
Flutter  in  countless  swarms  from  the  flame  that  blazes  behind  them 
Suddenly  kindled;  they  fly,  and  in  heaps  they  plunge  in  the  torrent: 
Thus,  as  Achilles  pursued,  was  the  stream, of  eddying  Xanthus 
Choked  with  the  mingled  wreck  of  men,  their  chariots  and  horses. 
Then  like  a  God  in  his  might  (his  spear  having  left  on  the  margin, 
Leaning  against  a  tamarisk's  stem)  he  plunged  in  the  river, 
Armed  with  his  sword  alone :  for  a  dreadful  resolve  had  he  taken. 
Round  him  on  ev'ry  side  he  smote,  and  the  shrieks  of  the  stricken  (20) 
Dismally  echoing  rang,  and  the  waves  with  blood  were  discoloured. 
And,  as  before  some  monstrous  shark   or  devouring  dolphin 
Swim  for  their  lives  the  frighted  fish,  and  the  inlets  and  havens 
Fill  with  their  shoals,  while  down  he  gulps  whatever  he  catches  :

Thus  into  caves  in  the  hollowed  banks  of  that  terrible  river 
Cowering,  th'  affrighted  Trojans  slunk  :  till  wearied  with  carnage 
Twelve  of  their  youth  he  selected  and  dragged  them  alive  from  the 

river, 
Destined  to  bleed  on  the  fun'ral  pyre  of  slaughtered  Patroclus. 
These  he  led  forth  like  frighted  fawns,  bewildered  with  terror,        (29) 
Binding  their  hands  behind  their  backs  with  the  straps  that  their  armour 
Fastened,  securing  the  twisted  mail  they  wore  to  protect  them : 
Then  to  his  comrades  consigned,  to  conduct  them  alive  to  the  vessels, 
And  with  insatiate  rage  rushed  back  once  more  to  the  river : 
There  encountered  Lycaon,  a  son  of  Dardanian  Priam, 
Just  from  the  flood  escaped,  whom  long  before  he  had  captured, 
Coming  upon  him  by  night  in  his  father's  land,   unexpected. 
There  a  wild  fig-tree's  boughs  he  found  him  busily  shaping 
Into  a  bordering  rim  for  his  chariot's  front ;   and  Achilles 
Seized  him,  surprised  and  reluctant,  and  bore  him  off  as  his  captive. 
Thence  to  the  Lemnian  isle  in  his  ships  transporting,  he  sold  him,  (40) 
And  in  the  city  of  Lemnos  by  Jason's  son  was  he  purchased; 
Ransomed  thence  by  his  Imbrian  friend,  Eetion's  kindness, 
(Sometime  his  guest),  who  with  many  a  gift  to  Arisbe  conveyed  him; 
Whence  escaping  he  reached  at  length  the  home  of  his  fathers. 
Thus,  from  Lemnos  returned,  for  elev'n  whole  days  in  the  palace 
Merry  he  made  with  his  friends.     On  the  twelfth,  (so  the  Gods  had 

disposed  it,) 
Into  the, hand  of  Achilles  again  he  fell,  who  should  send  him, 
Sore  reluctant,  and  longing  to  live,  to  the  mansions  of  Hades. 
Him  when  the  swift  Achilles  perceived,  escaped  from  the  river, 
Flying  unarmed,  without  or  shield  or  helmet,  and  swordless  (50) 

(All  had  he  cast  aside  on  the  ground  to  lighten  his  burthen), 
Sweat  pouring  down  from  his  limbs,  and  his  knees  scarce  able  to  bear 

him, 
Wrath  in  his  bosom  arose,  and  thus  he  communed  with  his  spirit : 
';Gods  !  what  wonder  is  this?  Can  I  trust  these  eyes  that  behold  it? 
Next  shall  I  see  those  Trojan  foes  whose  lives  I  have  taken 
Rising  again  from  the  murky  shades,  and  standing  before  me, 
Ev'n  as  I  see  this  man  returned,  escaped  from  his  bondage  :

455 


Him  whom  in  sacred  Lemnos  I  sold.     In  vain  to  confine  him 
Stretched  the  salt  waves  of  the  hoary  sea — to  so  many  a  barrier. 
Come  then  !   now  let  him  taste  the  biting  point  of  my  jav'lin ;        (60) 
So  shall  I  learn  at  length  the  truth,  and  know  from  experience, 
If  he  can  thence  once  more  return  where  now  I  shall  send  him, 
Or  if  the  teeming  earth,  which  imprisons  the  strong,  will  confine  him." 
Such   were    his    thoughts   as    the    terrified   wretch   now    turning, 
approached  him, 
Eager  to  clasp  his  knees:    one  only  thought  in  his  bosom 
Rising — death  to  escape,  and  the  dreadful  doom  that  impended. 
Godlike  Achilles,  high  upraised  in  act  to  destroy  him, 
Held  his  long  spear ;  but  he  bowed  him  down,  and  cow'ring  beneath  it 
Crept,  and  his  knees  embraced,  while  the  spear,  impatient  for  slaughter, 
Passing  above  his  back,  in  the  earth  stood  rooted  behind  him.       (70) 
Still  with  one  hand  he  held  his  knees  embraced,  while  the  other 
Reached  at  the  shaft  of  the  spear,  and  tightly  grasping,  detained  it: 
Suppliant  then  this  piteous  prayer  addressed  to  his  foeman  : 
"  Spare  me  !    O  Heav'n-descended  prince.     Have  pity  upon  me. 
Lo  !  I  embrace  thy  knees.     Revere  the  claim  of  a  suppliant. 
Have  I  not  shared  at  thy  board  the.  sacred  gifts  of  Demeter, 
From  that  unhappy  day  when  thou  tor'st  me  away  from  my  vineyard, 
Sending  me  thence  to  Lemnos,  afar  from  my  friends  and  my  father, 
Sold  into  bondage  : — a  hundred  beeves  the  price  that  I  brought  thee. 
Thrice    as    much   now   for   my  ransom   accept !    'Tis  now   but  the 
twelfth  day,  (80) 

Even  this  very  morn,  I  was  welcomed  back  unto  Ilion 
After  so  many  woes.     Now  fate  once  more  in  thy  power, 
Envious,  hath  thrown  me,  hated,  no  doubt,  by  Zeus  the  immortal, 
Father  of  all  that  hath  life;  who  hath  giv'n  me  up  to  thy  vengeance. 
Surely  for  few  and  roil  days  my  mother  Laothoe 
Bore  me,  the  daughter  of  ancient  Altes,  who  on  the  Satnios 
Ruled  over  Pedasus'  high-walled  town  and  the  brave  Lelegseans, 
One  of  the  numerous  wives  of  royal  Priam,  she  bore  us, 
Two  dear  sons  ;  and  both  alike  thou  doom'st  to  destruction. 
Brave  Polydorus,  liker  a  God  than  a  man,  with  the  foremost  (90) 

Marching  on  foot  to  the  fight,  thy  spear  hath  robbed  of  existence. 


456  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXI. 

Now  is  my  turn  arrived,  nor  dare  I  hope  to  escape  thee, 
Since  within  reach  of  thy  hands  mine  evil  genius  hath  flung  me. 
One  thing  more  will  I  add,  and  let  it  have  weight  in  my  favour. 
Kill  me  not !  Not  from  the  mother  I  sprang  of  him  whom  thou  hatest, 
Heel; or,  the  man  who    slew   thy  friend,  the  brave  and  the  gentle." 

Piteously  thus  for  life  the  son  of  illustrious  Priam 
Begged  :  but  a  stern  response  in  tones  of  thunder  rebuked  him : 
"Fool !  dost  thou  talk  of  ransom  to  me,  or  sue  for  my  pity? 
Ere  on  my  lov'd  Patroclus  the  fates'  decree  was  accomplished       (ioo) 
Often  to  mercy  my  soul  inclined,  nor  refused  to  the  Trojans 
Suppliant,  their  lives ;  but  captives  I  held,  and  sold  them  in  bondage. 
Now  shall  not  one  of  the  Trojans  escape  from  death,  whomsoever 
Zeus  to  my  vengeful  hands  before  Ilion's  walls  shall  deliver. 
All  shall  die :   but  foremost  and  first  the  children  of  Priam. 
Thou  too,  my  friend,  must  die  !  What  need  these  tears,  this  unmanly 
Grief?   Patroclus  died,  far  braver  and  better  than  thou  art. 
Look  on  myself !  how  great,  how  strong,  how  exulting  in  beauty  ! 
Spung  from  a  royal  sire  and  brave — my  mother  a  Goddess  ! 
I  too,  alike  with  thyself,  stern  fate  and  death  must  encounter,      (no) 
Be  it  at  dawn,  at  noon,  or  at  eve  : — that  hour  must  o'ertake  me, 
When  on  the  battle-field  I  shall  lie,  extended  and  lifeless, 
Slain  by  some  hostile  spear,  or  far-sent  shaft  from  the  bowstring." 

Thus  spake  the  gloomy  chief     Then  sank  the  heart  of  his  victim. 
Trembling,  his  knees  gave  way;  and  forsaking  his  hold  on  the  jav'lin 
Both  his  hands  he  upraised  to  Heav'n.     His  sword  then  Achilles 
Drew,  and  between  his  neck  and  his  shoulder  drove.    And  the  falchion, 
Two-edg'd,  plunged  to  the  hilt.    Then  down  he  sank  in  his  death-pang — 
Down  on  the  earth.     Black  flowed  his  blood,  with  dust  intermingling. 
Then  by  the  foot  Achilles  seized  him  and  dnto   the  river         (I2°) 
Flung,  to  be  swept  away,  with  words  of  bitter  derision : 
"Lie  thou  there  with  the  fish,  who  will  suck  thy  blood  as  it  issues 
Warm   from   thy  wound   at   their   ease.     O'er  thy  bier  no  mother, 

lamenting, 
E'er  shall  compose  thy  limbs  in  death;  but  boiling  Scamander 
Cast  thee  forth  to  the  vasty  deep  to  be  tossed  on  its  bosom. 
There  shall  full  many  a  fish  come  leaping  up  to  the  surface, 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  457 

Through  the  black  curl  of  its  waves,  to  gnaw  the  white  fat  of  Lycaon. 
Thus  shall  ye  perish,  strewing  the  way  to  your  Ilian  city, 
Trojans  in  headlong  flight,  Achilles  pursuing  and  slaying. 
Nor  shall  your  stream  avail  with  its  broad  and  silvery  eddies :      (130) 
What  though  many  a  steer  ye  have  slain  on  his  banks  to  appease  him, 
Many  a  noble  steed  have  plunged  alive  in  his  waters, 
None  the  less  shall  ye  die  by  an  evil  death  till  Patroclus, 
Slain,  be  avenged  upon  one  and  all,  and  the  woes  the  Achaians 
There  at  their  ships  endured,  while  I  held  aloof  from  the  conflict." 

Thus  he  spake :  but  wrath  arose  in  the  soul  of  the  stream-god. 
Much  he  revolved  how  best  he  might  check  the  career  of  Achilles, 
And  from  the  Trojans  best  avert  impending  destruction. 
Peleus'  son  meanwhile  with  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin 
Sprang  upon  Pelegos'  son,  the  godlike  Asteropaeus,  (I4°) 

Whom  Peribcea,  the  eldest  of  Akessamenos'  daughters, 
Bore,  when  in  wedlock  joined  with  the  god  of  the  wide-flowing  Axius, 
Mingling  his  race  divine  with  a  mortal  bride.     But  Achilles, 
Eager  to  slay  him,  rushed  on  the  chief  as  he  rose  from  the  river. 
Armed  with  two  spears  he  stood  his  ground,  for  Xanthus  inspir'd  him 
Inly  with  courage  and  strength,  at  the  pitiless  slaughter  indignant, 
Wrought  on  so  many,  -within  his  stream,  by  the  sword  of  Achilles. 

Now,  when  opposed  they  stood  and  were  rapidly  nearing  each  other, 
Haughtily  thus  commenced  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"  Who  then  art  thou  of  the  sons  ^/men  who  dar'st  to  withstand  me?  (150) 
Woe  to  the  parents  of  those  who  measure  their  might  with  Achilles  !" 
Pelegon's  valiant  son  these  words  returned  him  in  answer : 
"Why  demand'st  thou,  mighty  Achilles  !  my  name  and  my  lineage? 
Hither  I  come  from  afar,  from  the  fair  Paeonian  region, 
Fertile  and  rich :  and  I  lead  our  brave  Paeonian  spearmen. 
This  the  eleventh  morn  since  Ilion's  walls  have  received  me. 
From  the  great  source  of  Axius'  flood  I  derive  my  existence, 
Axius,  the  fairest  stream  that  enriches  the  earth  with  its  bounties. 
Thence  sprang  Pelegon,  famed  as  a  spearman  bold,  and  my  father. 
Such  my  acknowledged  birth.    Now  fight !  most  noble  Achilles."  (160) 

Threat'ning  he  spake.     Then  lifted  Achilles  the  Pelian  jav'lin, 
Pondrous  and  huge.     At  once  two  spears  from  Asteropaeus 


458  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXI. 

Flew,  for  with  equal  force  each  hand  delivered  its  weapon ; 
One  on  the  shield  of  Achilles  struck,  unavailing  to  pierce  it — 
By  the  firm  gold,  the  gift  of  a  God,  its  course  was  arrested — 
One  near  the  elbow-joint  of  the  strong  right  arm  of  his  foeman 
Grazed.     Forth  spouted  the  blood ;   but  the  spear  passed  on  and 

was  buried 
Deep  in  the  ground,  where  quivering  it  stood,  disappointed  of  carnage. 
Then  in  his  turn  Achilles,  with  full  resolve  to  destroy  him, 
Darted  at  Asteropaeus  the  Pelian  ash  ;  but  it  wandered  i1!0) 

Wide  of  its  mark,  and  the  spear  in  the  lofty  bank  of  the  river 
Plunged,  and  buried  the  half  of  its  ashen  shaft.  But  Achilles, 
Drawing  at  once  from  his  thigh  his  trenchant  blade,  on  his  foeman 
Sprang  with  a  fierce  assault.  But  he  at  the  spear  of  Peleides 
Tugging  with  all  the  might  of  his  stalwart  arms,  to  extract  it 
Vainly  attempted.  Thrice  he  essayed  it,  desperate  a?id  furious, 
Thrice  relinquished  the  baffled  attempt ;  then  strove  for  the  fourth 

time, 
Straining  with  all  his  force  to  break  the  spear  of  Achilles. 
Peleus'  son  with  his  sword  rushed  in,  and  cut  short  his  existence. 
Straight   through   the   navel   he   plunged   the  blade.     Then  gushed 

forth  his  entrails  (I^o) 

All  on  the  ground.     Thick  night  then  closed  o'er  his  eyes,  and  in 

death-pangs 
Gasping  he  lay.    On  his  bosom  Achilles  leaped,  and  his  armour 
Stripped  from  his  prostrate  form,  while  thus  he  exultingly  boasted  : 
"Lie  thou  there!  albeit  thou  claim'st  descent  from  a  River, 
Hard  'tis  for  such  to  strive  with  the  lofty  race  of  Kronion. 
Wide  tho'  the  sweep  of  thy  parent  stream,  and  majestic  its  current, 
'Tis  from  the  glorious  ruler  of  all  I  draw  my  existence, 
Peleus,  y^acus'  son,  of  the  populous  Myrmidon  nation 
Sovereign,  begat  me.    Zeus  himself  was  yEacus'  father. 
Far  as  his  might  transcends  the  streams  that  are  lost  in  the  ocean,  (190) 
Even  so  far  doth  his  race  excel  the  sons  of  the  Rivers. 
Lo  !  by  thy  side  pours  down  a  mighty  stream.    Could  it  aid  thee? 
Little,  I  ween  !  nor  mortal  nor  god  can  contend  with  Kronion, 
Not  Achelous  himself  in  the  high-swoll'n  pride  of  his  waters, 


Book  XXI.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  459 

Not  the  deep-rolling,  world-encircling  stream  of  the  ocean, 
He  from  whom  all  the  seas  with  all  their  waves  and  their  currents 
Draw  their  supply,  and  the   earth's  deep  wells,  its  springs  and  its 

fountains. 
All  from  the  blasting  flash  of  Kronion  shrink,  and  in  terror 
Quail,  when  his  thunder's  crash  rebellows  aloft  in  the  aether." 
Thus  spake  the  conquering  chief.     From  the  bank  then  plucked 

out  his  weapon,  (200) 

Leaving  behind  him  the  foe  outstretched  whose  life  he  had  taken, 
There  on  the  sand,  and  washed  by  the  break  of  the  dark  rolling  waters. 
Round  him  came  twining  the  eels,  and  the  greedy  fishes  assembled, 
Eager  to  feast  on  the  rich,  white  fat  that  enveloped  his  kidneys. 
On  flew  the  victor  in  chace  of  .the  crested  Pseonian  warriors, 
Scatt'ring  on  all  sides  far  and  wide  from  the  eddying  river, 
When  they  beheld  their  mightiest  chief  in  desperate  conflict;, 
Valiantly  slain  by  the  hands  and  beneath  the  sword  of  Peleides. 
Mydon  he  slew,  Thersilochus  next,  then  Astypylus  perished, 
^Eneus  and  Thracian  Mnesus  fell,  and  brave  Ophelestes.         (2I°) 
More  of  the  flying  Paeonian  host  had  vengeful  Achillas 
Slain;  but,  incensed,  interfered  the  swift  wide-eddying  Xanthus, 
Mingling  a  deep-toned  human  voice  with  the  roar  of  his  whirlpools  : 
"Peleus'  son!  in  valour  and  dreadful  deeds  thou  surpassest 
Aught  that  mortal  hath  done ;  for  the  gods  protect  and  assist  thee. 
Yet,  if  immortal  Zeus  to  thy  sword  hath  delivered  the  Trojans, 
Do  thy  murderous  work  on  the  plain,  nor  sully  my  waters. 
Foul  is  my  limpid  and  beauteous  stream  with  slaughter  and  carnage, 
Loaded  with  corpses  scarce  can  I  roll  my  waves  to  the  ocean, 
Choked  and  encumbered.    Furious  still  thou  persistest  in  slaying.  (220) 
Hold  thy  relentless  hand,  O  Prince  !    Thy  slaughters  dismay  me." 
Thus  in  his  turn  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles  : 
"Ev'n  as  thou  say'st,  Scamander  divine,  be  thy  bidding  accomplished. 
Yet  may  I  not  desist  from  destroying  those  insolent  Trojans, 
Till  to  their  city's  walls  I  shall  drive  them ;  and  Hector  encount'ring, 
Try  my  strength,  whether  he  or  I  shall  conquer  or  perish." 

Ending,  with  more  than  mortal  rage  he  rushed  on  the  Trojans, 
Then  to  Apollo  the  deep-flowing  stream  addressed  his  remonstrance : 


460  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXI. 

"Son  of  Kronion  !  lord  of  the  silver  bow!  thou  neglectest 
All  thy  great  parent's  high  commands — his  repeated  injunctions,  (230) 
Troia's  sons  to  assist  and  protect,  till  the  shadows  of  ev'ning 
Lengthen  across  the  plain,  and  night  shall  have  closed  on  the  battle." 

Thus  he  spake.    But  Achilles  plunged  once  more  in  the  torrent, 
Leaping  from  off  the  bank.    Then  rose  in  his  fury  the  River, 
Rearing  up  all  his  waves  amain,  and  spewed  forth  the  corses 
Out  on  the  shore — those  countless  dead  Achilles  had  slaughtered ; 
Tossing  them  all  abroad  with  the  bellowing  roar  of  a  wild  bull 
Maddened  with  rage.    While  those  who  yet  survived  he  protected, 
Hiding  them  deep  in  the  hollow  whirls  of  his  beauteous  water ; 
High  o'er  Achilles  curled  the  bursting  waves,  and  descending  (240) 
Fell  with  a  crash  on  his  shield.    No  longer  maintained  he  his  footing 
Firm  on  the  shifting  ground.     Then  he  clutched  for  support  at  an  elm- 
tree, 
Vig'rous  of  growth  and  large  :  but  the  root  gave  way,  and  it  tumbled, 
Tearing  to  pieces  the  bank  in  its  fall,  and  cov'ring  the  waters 
Thick  with  its  floating  boughs,  which  served  as  a  bridge  for  the  hero 
Over  the  flood  beneath.     Then  out  he  sprang  from  the  torrent, 
And  o'er  the  plain  in  haste  with  nimble  feet  he  retreated, 
Struck  with  unwonted  dread.     Nor  desisted   the  God,  but  pursued 

him, 
Black'ning  in  billowy  heaps,  that  in  mid  career  of  his  vengeance 
Peleus'  godlike  son  might  be  stopped  and  the  Trojans  delivered. 
Far  as  a  spear  might  fly  on  his  way  then  darted  Achilles,  i2^1) 

Ev'n  as  the  dark-winged  eagle  darts  in  pursuit  of  his  quarry, 
Swiftest  and  strongest  of  all  the  birds  that  soar  under  Heaven. 
Thus  pursued  he  his  course,  while  the  brazen  arms  in  his  bosom 
Harshly  clashed  as  he  ran ;  and  now  by  swerving  obliquely 
Thought  to  escape  :   but  the  flood  rushed  roaring  on  and  pursued 

him. 
As  when  from  some  dark  mountain-source  one  leads  forth  the  water, 
Turning  its  course  on  the  plants,  and  thirsting  beds  of  his  garden, 
Mattock  in  hand,  its  channel  he  clears  from  dirt  and  obstructions ; 
On  as  it  pours  it  gathers  strength,  and  scatters  the  pebbles,  (260) 
Rolling  them  on;  till  a  steep  descent  attaining,  it  plunges 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  461 

Headlong  down  with  wild  turmoil,  and  outruns  its  conductor  : 
Thus  overtook  the  flood  in  its  race  the  flying  Achilles, 
Swift  as  he  was  :  for  the  might  of  Gods  that  of  mortals  surpasses. 
Oft  as  Achilles  resolved  in  his  mind  to  turn  and  resist  it, 
Making  a  stand,  and  learn  whether  all  the  Gods  who  in  heaven 
Dwell  had  combined  to  drive  him  back,  and  frustrate  his  triumph, 
Curling  above  him,  the  heav'n-engendered  stream  on  his  shoulders 
Dashed  in  a  whelming  wave.     Then  aloft  he  sprang  with  an  effort 
Wroth    and    indignant.     Still    persisted    the    stream,    and    assailed 
him,  (27o) 

Striking  aside  his  knees,  and  sweeping  the  sand  from  beneath  him. 
Deeply  Peleides  groaned,  his  eyes  uplifting  to  heaven  : 
"Father  Zeus  !  will  no  pitying  God  then  come  to  my  rescue 
From  this  infuriate  flood  ?    All  else  will  I  cheerfully  suffer. 
None  of  the  high  Olympian  pow'rs  so  deeply  hath  wronged  me 
As  my  own  mother  dear,  who  led  me  on  by  deception. 
She  it  was  who  predicted  my  fall  by  the  shafts  of  Apollo 
Swift,  overta'en,   before  the  walls  of  the  corsleted  Trojans. 
Had  I  but  fall'n  by  Hector's  hand,  their  mightiest  and  bravest, 
Then  had  I  died  a  hero's  death,  and  been  spoiled  by  a  hero.      (280) 
Now  by  a  base  and  vulgar  fate  am  I  destined  to  perish, 
Swept  away  by  the  stream  :  like  a  swine-herd  lad  who  in  crossing 
Misses  his  step  in  some  brawling  brook  which  he  fords  in  the  winter." 

Thus  he  spake.     Poseidon  at  once  and  Pallas  Athene 
Standing  beside  him  appeared — revealed  in  the  semblance  of  mortals, 
Grasping  his  hands  in  their  own,  and  words  of  encouragement  utt'ring. 
First  Poseidon,  the  great  earth-shaking  monarch,  addressed  him : 
"Be  of  good  cheer,  Peleides!   and  cast  all  terror  behind  thee. 
Here  we  stand,  two  powerful  Gods,  thine  aids  and  supporters 
(Zeus  permitting  our  aid) — myself  and  Pallas  Athene.  (29°) 

Not  by  the  might  of  that  whelming  flood  art  thou  destined  to  perish. 
Soon  will  its  stream  to  its  course  return,  and  thou  shalt  behold  it. 
We  will  support  thee,  bravely  and  well,  if  thou  wilt  but  obey  us. 
Hold  not  thy  hand,  nor  cease  from  this  all-devastating  warfare, 
Till  within  Ilion's  far-famed  walls  the  fugitive  Trojans 
Headlong  are  driv'n,  and  Hector  himself  shall  have  fall'n  to  thy  prowess.

Then  to  thy  ships  retire.      This  grace,  this  glory  we  grant  thee." 

Thus,  as  with  one  accord,  they  spake,  and  rejoined  the  immortals; 
On  then  he  sped,  at  the  heav'nly  behest  fresh  vigour  imbibing, 
Far   o'er   the   plain    deep    drowned    with    the    out-poured    rush   of 
the  waters,  (300) 

Where  with  their  mingled  corses  the  beauteous  arms  of  the  slaughtered 
Floated  unnumbered.     High  o'er  the  flood  right  onward  he  bounded. 
Leap  after  leap,  unwearied ;  nor  aught  availed  to  impede  him 
All  the  wide-rolling  stream  could  oppose — for  Athena  upheld  him. 
Nor  did  Scamander  relax  in  wrath,  but  increasing  in  fury, 
Raged  against  Peleus'  son,  and  swelled  yet  higher  and  higher, 
Breaking  in  crests  of  foam  1  and  he  called  aloud  upon  Simois  : 
"Aid  me,  my  brother  !  Join  we  our  force  this  mortal  to  conquer, 
Else  will  he  soon  subvert  the  stately  city  of  Priam, 
Dear  to  us  both;  since  vainly  the  Trojans  strive  to  resist  him.       (310) 
Lose   not   a   moment !   Swell   thy   flood  with  the   brooks   from  the 

mountains  ; 
Summon  thy  tribute  streams  from  the  region  around  to  assist  thee ; 
Heave  up  thy  waves,  and  roll  before  thee  the  trunks  and  the  boulders 
Thund'ring  along,   and  crush  this  mad  presumptuous  mortal, 
Vaunting  himself  like  a  God,  and  bearing  down  all  opposition. 
Nought  shall  his  strength,  I  ween,  avail  him  now,  nor  his  beauty, 
Nor  his  resplendent  arms,  which  soon  shall  dazzle  no  longer, 
All  overwhelm'd  with  stifling  ooze ;  and  his  corse  will  I  bury 
Deep  in  the  sand,  weighed  down  and  heaped  with  mussels  and  peb- 
bles, 
So  that  in  vain  for  his  bones  the  Greeks  may  search,  to  collect  them : 
Such  and  so  vast  the  mingled  mass  I  shall  pile  up  above  them    (321) 
Which  for  his  fun'ral  mound  must  serve.     Small  need  for  the  Argives 
There  to  erect  a  pile,  attd  call  it  the  tomb  of  Achilles" 
Ending,  again  the  raging  river  Achilles  assaulted. 
Deeply  empurpled,  the  heav'n-engendered  stream  in  its  fury 
Rushed  upon  him,  turbid  with  foam,  with  blood,  and  with  corses, 
Rearing  its  waves  aloft  and  dashing  them  down  on  Peleides. 
Hera  at  length,  who  beheld  with  alarm  her  hero  in  danger, 
Dreading  to  see  him  whelmed  in  the  whirls  of  the  eddying  waters, 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  463 

Cried  aloud  to  Hephaestus,  her  much-loved  son,  to  assist  him  :     (330) 
"Up,  my  son  !   Though  tardy  in  pace,  yet  in  conflict  with  Xanthus 
Equally  matched  with  his  eddying  flood,  thy  might  we  acknowledge. 
Haste  to  the  rescue  !   Bring  thy  flames,  and  appear  in  thy  splendour  / 
I  myself  to  the  shore  will  speed,  and  Notus  and  Zephyr 
Summon  from  seaward  to  join  us  with  all  the  force  of  their  tempests. 
Drifting  along  thy  blasting  flames,  let  them  scorch  up  the  Trojans, 
Men  consuming  and  arms ;  and  do  thou  on  the.  margin  of  Xanthus 
Burn  up  the  trees,  and  thy  parching  fires  let  loose  on  the  river. 
Nor  be  thou  turned  aside  by  persuasive  words  or  by  threat'nings, 
Nor  from  thy  task  desist,  nor  abate  thy  rage,  till  thou  hear  me     (340) 
Issue  my  loud  command.    Then  let  thy  flames  be  extinguished." 

Swift  at  her  word  Hephaestus  with  burning  fiery  flashes 
Swept  o'er  the  plain — with  his  scorching  blast  consuming  the  corses 
Thick  o'er  the  field  lying  strewed  by  the  slaughtering  sword  of  Achilles. 
Dried  up  at  once  was  the  plain,  and  the  stream  forced  back  from  its 

wand'rings. 
As  when  some  deep  o'erflooded  tract  dries  up  in  the  autumn, 
Under  the  parching  wind  from  the  north,  and  its  owner  rejoices: 
Thus  was  the  plain  laid  dry,  and  the  dead  consumed;  and  Hephaestus 
Next  with  conflagration  fierce  invaded  the  river.  (349) 

Blazed  ev'ry  elm,  each  willow,  each  tamarisk  shrub  on  its  margin, 
Lotus  and  reeds  the  crackling  fames  licked  up,  and  the  rushes, 
Which  from  its  beauteous  streams  stood  forth  in  luxuriant  profusion ; 
Gasping,  the  eels  and  the  shoals  offish  exhausted  and  flaccid, 
Writhed,  expiring  beneath  the  scorching  breath  of  Hephaestus, 
Which  in  the  clear,  bright-eddying  flood  were  wont  to  disport  them. 
All  in  a  simmer,  the  stream  found  words,  and  thus  it  addressed  him : 
"  None  of  the  Gods  need  hope  to  withstand  thy  pow'r,  O  Hephaestus  I 
Armed  with  thy  dire  consuming  flames.    I  shrink  from  the  contest. 
Leave  me  in  peace  !  Henceforth,  let  Achilles  slay  as  it  lists  him; 
Drive  out  the  Trojans  from  Troy.     What  have  I  to  do  with  their 

quarrel?"  (360) 

Thus  he  spake.    But  his  seething  stream  now  boiled  from  its  bottom. 
As  when  in  some  huge  caldron,  by  flames  surrounded,  the  water 
Boils,  as  it  melts  out  the  fat  of  some  mast-fed  swine  of  the  forest, 


464 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXI. 


Bubbling  it  sputters  abroad,  the  dry  logs  blazing  beneath  it : 
Thus,  at  the  sting  of  the  piercing  fire  up  bubbled  the  river. 
Onward  his  waves  no  more  he  rolled,;  but  stopped,  and,  exhausted, 
Shrank  at  Hephaestus'  withering  breath,  and  called  upon  Here, 
Dolefully  praying,  and  thus  in  beseeching  words  he  addressed  her : 
"Here  !  why  doth  thy  son  so  bitterly  plague  and  torment  me      (369) 
More  than  all  other  streams  ?   Far  less  have  I  done  to  enrage  thee, 
Less  than  many  a  mightier  pow'r  have  befriended  the  Trojans. 
Now  and  henceforth  will  I  cease  to  support  them  if  so  thou  com- 

mandest : 
Let  him  but  hold  his  hand.     This  too  will  I  promise  and  swear  it, 
Not  one  man  of  the  Trojans  to  save  from  the  fate  that  awaits  him, 
Not  should  the  city  of  Troy  itself  in  one  vast  conflagration 
Sink,  and  Achaia's  warlike  sons  achieve  her  destruction." 

This  when  she  heard,  the  white-armed  Goddess  Hera  relented, 
And  on  Hephaestus  her  dear-lov'd  son  thus  laid  her  injunctions  : 
"  Cease  !  my  glorious  son,  my  Hephaestus  !  Ill  it  beseems  us, 
Cruelly  thus,  for  a  mortal's  sake  an  immortal  to  punish."  (380) 

Here  thus :  and  the  God  that  dread  conflagration  extinguished. 
Once  more  rolled  the  fair  stream  in  the  tranquil  course  of  its  waters. 
Then,  seeing  Xanthus  thus  subdued  and  at  rest,  they  desisted : 
Hera  restraining  the  rage  of  her  son,  though  deeply  indignant. 
Now  among  all  the  rest  of  the  Gods  contention  and  discord 
Unrestrained  broke  forth.     High  swelled  each  bosom  with  anger, 
Groaned  the  wide  earth  beneath  as  they  closed  on  each  other  in  tem- 
pest, 
Rang  the  high  arch  of  heav'n  with  a  trumpet's  clang:  and  the  Thun- 

d'rer, 
Sitting  aloft  on  Olympus,  the  uproar  heard;  and  it  pleased  him 
Much,  and  he   laughed   in   his   heart   when   he  saw   th'  immortals 
contending.  (39°) 

Not  long  held  they  aloof  from  each  other.    Ares  the  foremost, 
Cleaver  of  shields,  advanced  to  contend  with  Pallas  Athene. 
Grasping  his  brazen  spear,  in  insulting  words  he  addressed  her : 
"  Insolent  pest !  who  troublest  the  gods  with  strife  and  contention, 
Why  so  forward  and  bold?  what  prompts  thy  spirit  of  mischief? 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  465 

Hast  thou  forgot  the  day  when  thou  set'st  Diomedes  upon  me, 
Bidding  him  wound  me,  and  thou  thyself  his  glittering  jav'lin 
Seized,  and  directed  its  flight,  and  drove  it  straight  through  my  body  ? 
Now  thou  shalt  suffer,  methinks,  for  all  the  pain  thou  hast  wrought  me." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  her  JEgis  dread  with  fringes  surrounded  (400) 
Smote  :  but  to  pierce  it  the  lightning  of  Zeus  had  proved  unavailing. 
This  with  his  spear  attempted  in  vain  the  murderous  Ares. 
Gliding  aside  she  stooped,  and  a  stone  perceiving,  upraised  it, 
Rugged   and  huge  and  black,  from  the  plain  where  it  lay,  for  a 

landmark, 
Planted  by  men  of  elder  days  to  define  their  possessions. 
This  with  her  mighty  hand  she  on  Ares  dashed,  and  it  smote  him 
Full  on  the  neck.    He  fell.    Sev'n  roods  he  covered  in  falling. 
Soiled  were  his  locks  in  the  dust,  and  his  armour  clashed.  But  Athene' 
Laughed,  and  in  words  of  scornful  triumph  addressed  her  opponent : 
"Fool !  wilt  thou  never  learn  how  far  in  might  I  surpass  thee  ?    (410) 
(And  by  no  empty  boast) — but  wilt  match  thyself  ever  against  me. 
Now  thou  but  feel'st  the  effecl  of  thy  mother's  curse  and  her  vengeance 
Threate?ied  against  thee  in  wrath  for  deserting  the  cause  of  Achaia, 
And  for  the  aid  thou  giv'st  to  the  faithless  and  insolent  Trojans." 
Thus  she  spake,  and  her  bright  blue  eyes  in  contempt  she  averted. 
Groaning  much,  and  scarce  recov'ring  his  breath,  Aphrodite, 
Daughter  of  Zeus,  her  helping  hand  extended  to  raise  him. 
This  when  Hera  the  fair-armed  goddess  beheld,  to  Athene 
Quickly  she  turned,  and  thus  with  indignant  words  she  bespoke  her : 
"See  !  thou  unconquered  daughter  of  ^gis-upholding  Kronion,  (420) 
See  how  that  plague  of  my  life  assists  the  murderer  Ares ! 
Helping  him  off  from  the  battle-field.    Up  !  follow  and  crush  them." 
Thus  she  spake ;  and  Athena  rejoicing  heard,  and  pursued  them, 
Quickly  o'ertook  them,  and  full  on  the  bosom  of  fair  Aphrodite 
Dealt  with  her  heavy  hand  a  blow.    Down  dropped  she  and  fainted. 
Down  on  the  grassy  sod  they  rolled,  the  one  and  the  other. 
While  in  exulting  tones  thus  broke  forth  Pallas  Athene: 
"So  be  it  ever  to  all  who  would  lend  the  Trojans  assistance, 
All  who  wish  ill  to  the  mail-clad  Greeks  or  oppose  them  in  battle  ! 
Brave  be  they,  much  enduring,  as  now  we  behold  Aphrodite,    (430)

466  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXI. 

Daringly  lending  her  aid  to  Ares,  braving  my  vengeance. 
So,  but  for  such  as  these,  long  since  had  we  ceased  from  our  warfare, 
Long  since  Ilion's  walls  o'erturned  and  her  empire  subverted." 
Pleased  was  the  white-armed  Hera,  and  smiled  on  Pallas  Athene. 
Then  to  Apollo  thus  began  the  Lord  of  the  earthquake: 
"Phoebus  !  why  hold  we  our  hands  and  stand  apart?  is  it  seemly 
Peaceful  to  stand  while  others  have  joined  in  fight  ?  'twere  disgraceful 
Back,  without  striking  a  blow,  to  return  to  the  halls  of  Olympus. 
Come  then,  begin.    Thou  art  younger  by  birth.    Myself  it  befits  not 
First  to  strike ;  thy  elder  in  years,  thy  superior  in  wisdom.      (440) 
Foolish  indeed  thou  art,  and  devoid  of  sense  and  reflection. 
Hast  thou  forgotten  the  woes  we  both  endured,  when  to  Ilion 
We  two,  alone  of  the  gods,  were  sent  to  serve  by  Kronion : 
How  for  a  year  entire  we  laboured  hard  for  a  guerdon, 
L'nder  Laomedon's  harsh  commands,  who  promised  its  payment  ? 
I  for  the  Trojans  built  the  wall  which  their  city  surrounded, 
Solid  a?id  broad  and  fair,  for  its  sure  defence  and  protection. 
Phoebus !  thou  through  the  grassy  slopes  and  forests  of  Ida 
Follow'dst  in  herdsman's  guise  the  tardy  steps  of  his  cattle. 
But  when  the  joyous  Hours  brought  round  our  day  of  requital,    (450) 
Payment  th'  imperious  king,  on  his  might  unjustly  relying, 
Flatly  refused,  and  with  angry  words  and  threats  he  dismissed  us. 
Thee  did  he  threaten  to  bind,  both  hand  and  foot,  and  in  fetters, 
Sold  into  bondage  afar  in  some  distant  isle,  to  transport  thee ; 
Vowing  we  both  should  lose  our  ears  if  we  dared  to  remonstrate. 
Off  we  went,  in  bitter  despite  and  smothered  resentment, 
Thus  to  be  robbed  of  our  hoped  reward — the  pay  he  had  promised. 
Such  is  the  race  thou  fondlest — withdrawing  thyself,  when  we  counsel 
How  we  may  most  severely  requite  those  insolent  Trojans, 
Root  them  out  from  the  land,   and  destroy  their  wives  and  their 
children."  (460) 

Thus  to  Poseidon  replied  the  king,  far-darting  Apollo: 
'"'Earth-shaking  Pow'r!  unwise  indeed  might'st  thou  deem  me,  and  justly, 
If  for  the  sake  of  mortal  men  I  should  dare  to  assail  thee: 
Wretched  they  are  \  like  the  forest-leaves  they  flourish  and  wither, 
Now  full-fed  with  the  earth's  best  fruits,  they  expand  in  their  vigour 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  467 

Now  in  their  turn  they  shrivel  and  pine.    Then  why  should  we  quarrel  ? 
Rest  we  in  peace!  and  let  them  fight  it  out  as  it  lists  them." 

Thus  having  spoken  he  turned  away,  for  he  thought  it  presumptuous 
'Gainst  his  great  Father's  brother  to  raise  his  hands  in  contention. 
Artemis  then,  his  sister,  the  huntress  Queen,  who  in  wood-craft 
Ever  delights,  addressed  him  with  taunts  and  bitter  reproaches:  (471) 
"What !  dost  thou  fly,  far-darting  king,  and  yield  to  Poseidon 
All  the  glory  of  conquest,  and  all  the  boast  of  a  triumph  ? 
Weakling  !  why  dost  thou  bear  that  toy  of  a  bow  at  thy  shoulder? 
Ne'er  let  me  hear  thee  vaunt  in  our  father's  palace  henceforward, 
As  thou  hast  done  full  many  a  time  before,  that  in  combat 
Undismayed  thou  wouldst  dare  to  meet  the  Lord  of  the  earthquake." 
Thus  she  spake :  but  nought  replied  far-darting  Apollo. 
Such  reproaches  the  spouse  august  of  Zeus  overhearing, 
Turned  on  the  queen  of  the  silver  shafts,  and  indignant  reviled  her  1(480) 
"Shameless  and  insolent  creature  !  how  dar'st  thou  thus  to  oppose  us  ? 
Ill  mightst  thou  match  thy  strength  with  mine  or  hope  to  resist  me. 
'Spite  of  thy  silver  shafts.    A  very  lioness  art  thou 
Over  the  women  of  earth,  appointed  by  Zeus  to  destroy  them 
Just  as  thou  wilt.    'Twere  wiser  to  slay  the  doe  on  the  mountains, 
Or,  for  a  nobler  game,  the  stately  stag  to  encounter. 
But  if  thou  court  defeat  and  wilt  dare  the  issue  of  combat, 
Soon  shalt  thou  find  how  weak  thy  force  which  to  mine  thou  wouldst 

equal." 
Thus  having  spoken  both  her  wrists  she  seized  with  her  left  hand, 
While  with  the  right  from  her  shoulder  she  snatched  her  bow  and 

her  quiver.  (49°) 

Laughing  aloud,  with  these  on  her  ears  hard  cuffs  she  inflicted, 
'Spite    of  her   struggles ;   and   all  the  shafts  from  the  quiver  were 

scattered. 
Drowned  in  tears  to  the  skies  she  flew,  like  a  dove  that,  escaping, 
Ruffled  in  plume,  though  not  doom'd  to  die,  among  rocky  recesses, 
Refuge  seeks,  and  in  clefts,  from  the  murderous  hawk  that  has  torn  her. 
Sobbing  she  fled,  and  left  on  the  ground  her  bow  and  her  arrows. 
Next  unto  Leto  addressed  these  words  the  slayer  of  Argus  : 
"Leto,  with  thee  I  dare  not  fight.    'Twere  hard  with  a  goddess

Favoured  and  loved  by  cloud-compelling  Zeus  to  encounter;  (499) 
Look  on  me  then  as  conquered,  and  make  thy  boast  of  the  conquest 
Won  by  thy  might,  when  next  thou  rejoin'st  the  blessed  immortals." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  Leto  the  crooked  bow  and  the  arrows 
One  by  one  picked  up  from  the  whirling  dust  that  defiled  them. 
These  collected,  away  from  the  field  her  daughter  she  followed, 
Who  to  Olympus  had  fled,  to  the  bronze-built  dome  of  Kronion. 
Weeping,  the  virgin  goddess  flew  to  the  knees  of  her  father, 
Where,  as  she  knelt,  with  her  sobs  th'  ambrosial  mantle  around  her 
Trembled.  Her  father  embraced,  and  tenderly  smiling,  addressed  her: 
"Which  of  the  gods  hath  abused  and  evil  entreated  my  daughter?  (509) 
Shameful !  as  if  committing  some  wrongful  deed  they  had  found  her  ?" 
Then  made  answer  the  Huntress,  her  ruffled  wreath  readjusting: 
"'Twas   thine   own   wife,    the    white-armed    Hera,  my  father,   who 

beat  me ; 
She  who  hath  scattered  among  the  gods  contention  and  discord." 

Such  was  the  converse  held  on  high  between  Zeus  and  his  daughter. 
Now  to  Olympus  the  other  gods  returned  from  the  conflict, 
These  in  defeat  and  wrath,  those  flushed  with  success  and  rejoicing. 
And  around  Zeus  they  took  their  seats.     But  Phoebus  Apollo 
Entered  the  sacred  city  of  Troy,  to  watch  o'er  its  safety. 
Much  he  feared  for  the  walls  of  the  beauteous  city  of  Priam, 
Lest  that  the  Greeks  in  spite  of  fate  that  day  should  destroy  them.  (520) 
Mighty  Achilles  the  while,  both  man  and  horse  of  the  Trojans 
Went  on  slaying.     As  when,  from  a  city  in  flames,  to  the  heavens, 
Rises  the  smouldering  smoke,  when  the  wrath  of  the  gods  overtakes  it, 
Slaughter  and  death  are  abroad,  and  all  is  destruction  and  horror  : 
Such  was  Achilles'  rage  :  such  vengeance  burst  on  the  Trojans. 

High  on  a  sacred  tow'r  old  Priam  stood,  and  beneath  him 
Saw  with  dismay  the  giant  might  of  Peleides  approaching — 
Saw  how  the  scattered  Trojans  on  all  sides  fell  to  his  prowess, 
Utterly  broken  in  strength.    Then  quick  from  the  tow'r  he  descended, 
Groaning,  and  thus  to  the  guards  of  the  gate  delivered  his  orders :  (530) 
"  Fling  wide  open  the  gates ;  but  hold  them  in  hand,  that  the  people 
All  may  enter  who  fly  to  the  town.     Behind  them  Achilles 
Follows  enraged — and  sadly  I  dread  some  terrible  issue ! 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  469 

But  when  they  all  are  entered,  and  once  take  breath  in  the  city, 
Close  then  the  gates,  and  with  bolts  and  beams  of  timber  secure  them, 
Lest,  as  I  fear,  that  dreadful  man  should  enter  the  city." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  bolts  were  drawn,  and  the  gates  were  expanded, 
Broadly  admitting  the  light  and  the  flying  host.     But  Apollo 
Hastened  forth,  intent  on  averting  ill  from  the  Trojans. 
These,  exhausted  with  thirst,  with  dust  defiled,  in  confusion       (540) 
Fled  from  the  field  to  the  town  and  its  lofty  tow'rs.    But  Achilles, 
Wielding  his  dreadful  lance,  pressed  on,  with  the  rage  of  a  madman 
Burning  within  his  heart,  and  a  herds  longing  for  glory. 
Then  had  Achaia's  sons  burst  open  the  gates  of  the  city, 
Had  not  Apollo  Antenor's  son,  the  brave  and  the  blameless, 
Mighty  Agenor,  aroused,  and  nerved  for  the  dreadful  encounter. 
Filling  his  heart  with  undaunted  fire;  and  ever  beside  him, 
Taking  his  stand,  to  avert  the  leaden  grasp  of  destruction. 
Close  to  the  beech  they  stood,  and  a  dense  mist  shrouded  the  godhead. 
Soon  as  Agenor  beheld  the  destroyer  of  cities,  Achilles,  (55°) 

Firm  as  a  rock  he  stood  (some  whit  though  his  spirit  misgave  him), 
And  with  his  mighty  soul  communed,  as  his  foe  he  awaited : 
"Now  must  I  make  up  my  mind  !    If  I  fly  from  the  rage  of  Achilles 
Thither,  where  all  the  rest  of  my  friends  in  confusion  are  crowding, 
Then  will  he  overtake  me,  and  strike  off  my  head  for  a  coward. 
But  if  I  let  them  take  their  course  and  fly  from  Peleides, 
Townwards,  and  turn  my  steps  away  from  the  walls,  and  to  Ida 
Fly,  with  my  utmost  speed  through  the  plains  at  its  foot,    and  its 

forests 
Enter,  and  dark  retreats ;  and  hide  myself  i?i  its  thickets ; 
Then  towards  even-tide  may  I  bathe  myself  in  its  fountains,         (560) 
Cleanse  the  sweat  from  my  limbs,  and  return  refreshed  unto  Ilion. 
Why  do  my  thoughts  however  suggest  so  desf  rate  a  venture •? 
What,  should  he  mark  the  course  I  take,  away  from  the  city, 
Out  to  the  plain,  and  with  those  unwearied  feet  should  pursue  me : 
How  could  I  ever  expect  to  escape  black  death  and  destruction, 
Since  beyond  all  men  fierce  and  strong  I  know  my  pursuer? 
What,  if  before  the  city  I  wait  his  attack,  and  oppose  him? 
Only  one  life  he  bears.    Men  say  that  he  is  but  a  mortal, 


470  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXI. 

(What  though  almighty  Zeus  until  now  have  allowed  him  to  triumph); 
Nor  is  his  flesh  so  firm  but  that  spears  and  arrows  may  pierce  it."  (570) 

Thus  having  said,  collected  in  might  he  awaited  Achilles, 
Fixed  in  his  heart  was  the  firm  resolve  to  fight  to  the  utmost. 
As  when  a  panther  forth  from  some  deep  recess  of  the  forest 
Bursts  on  the  hunter's  path,  unscared  by  his  shouts  or  his  weapons. 
Not  for  a  moment  turns  to  flight,  but  faces  the  danger, 
Wounded  albeit,  and  pierced  by  the  spear,  or  darts  from  a  distance, 
Ere  he  can  spring ;  his  spirit  disdains  retreat  or  evasion, 
Eager  alone  to  grapple  his  foe  and  tear  him,  or  perish : 
Thus  stood  Antenor's  godlike  son,  the  noble  Agenor, 
Flight  disdaining,  prepared  for  a  trial  of  strength  with  Achilles  ;   (580) 
Evenly  held  before  him  the  polished  orb  of  his  buckler ; 
Took  sure  aim  with  his  lance;  and  shouted  aloud  in  defiance: 
"High,  no  doubt,  is  the  hope  in  thy  heart,  most  noble  Achilles  ! 
This  day  to  enter  in  arms  the  strong-built  town  of  the  Trojans. 
Idle  hopes  !    full  many  a  toil  still  waits  thee  before  it : 
Many  and  brave  within  Ilion's  walls  are  its  noble  defenders, 
Men  who  will  fight  till'  death  for  their  sires,  their  wives,  and  their 

children. 
There,  on  the  spot  where  thou  stand'st  thyself,  thy  fate  shall  o'ertake 

thee. 
All  renowned  as  thou  art,  and  proud  of  thy  might  as  a  warrior." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  his  strong  right  hand  delivered  the  jav'lin,  (590) 
Aiming  beneath  the  knee;  and  full  on  the  limb  it  alighted. 
Rudely  it  rang  on  the  new-made  greave  of  tin  which  encased  it, 
Pow'rless  however  to  pierce — and  off  the  weapon  rebounded, 
Turned  by  the  stubborn  strength  of  the  woruTrous  gift  of  Hephaestus. 
Now  came  Peleides'  turn ;  and  he  rushed  on  godlike  Agenor. 
Phoebus  however  interposed,  nor  permitted  his  triumph; 
Snatched  him  away,  and  in  gathering  mists  and  darkness  involved  him, 
Placing  him  far  remote  from  the  fight,  in  peace  and  in  safety. 
Next,  that  Peleides  thus  might  be  led  from  pursuing  the  Trojans, 
He,  the  far-darter,  taking  the  form  exact  of  Agenor,  (600) 

Stood,  for  a  moment,  before  him,  and  ran.    Swift  followed  Achilles. 
Thus  o'er  the  fertile  plain  he  led  him,  away  from  the  city, 


Book  XXL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  471 

Foll'wing  along  the  winding  course  of  eddying  Scamander. 
Ever  he  kept  some  space  in  advance,  and  tempted  him  onwards, 
Hoping  to  overtake,  by  his  woruProus  speed,  and  to  slay  him. 
Now  came  the  Trojans  crowding  in  haste  through  the  gates  of 

the  city, 
Happy,  relieved  from  fear,  and  the  town  was  filled  with  the  flying. 
None  of  them  dared  outside  the  walls  to  remain  and  to  question 
Who  in  the  battle  had  fall'n,  and  who  survived  the  disaster; 
Only  too  glad  themselves  to  save:  whosoever  escaped  it  (610) 

Thanking  the  gods,  and  blessing  the  strength  of  his  limbs  and  their 

swiftness.

Argument. 


Hector  alone  of  the  Trojans  persists  in  remaining  on  the  field, 
resolved  to  meet  Achilles.  Priam  and  Hecuba  endeavour  to  dissuade  him, 
but  in  vain.  Achilles  advancing,  his  resolution  fails  him,  and  he  flies. 
Achilles  pursues  hii7i  thrice  round -the  walls  of  Troy.  The  Gods  debate 
concerning  his  fate,  but  at  length  Zeus  consents  to  his  death.  Apollo 
forsakes  him.  Pallas  descends,  and  arresting  the  pursuit  of  Achilles, 
takes  the  form  of  Deiphobus,  and  persuades  Heclor  to  make  a  stand, 
promising  to  support  him.  The  heroes  fight.  Pallas  forsakes  Heclor, 
and  assists  Achilles,  who  slays  him,  despoils  him  of  his  arms,  and  drags 
his  body  after  his  chariot  in  the  sight  of  his  parents.  Their  lamentations. 
Andromache  hears  their  cries,  and  mounting  the  walls,  beholds  her 
husband'' s  bedy  in  the  acl  of  being  dragged  off  the  field.  She  swoons,  and 
reviving,  breaks  forth  in  lamentations. 


ILIAD.     BOOK  XXII. 


HPHUS  to  the  city  like  frightened  deer  came  flocking  the  Trojans; 
-*-    Wiped  off  the  sweat,  and  quenched  their  burning  thirst,  and  re- 
posing, 
Panting,  leaned  on  the  battlements  fair :  while  onward  the  Grecians, 
Marching,  approached  the  walls,  their  shields  inclined  to  their  shoul- 
ders. 
Hector  however  his  evil  fate  enchained ;   nor  permitted 
Shelter  to  seek.     At  the  Scsean  gate  the  Greeks  he  confronted. 

Now  on  Peleides  Apollo  turned,  revealed  in  his  Godhead: 
''Why,"  he  addressed  him,  "  Peleus'  son  !  dost  thou  hope  to  o'ertake 

me, 
Mortal  thyself  a  celestial  pow'r  pursuing,  and  know'st  not 
Whom  thou  pursu'st,  and  deluded  by  passion  still  thou  persistest,  (10) 
All  forgetful  of  Troy  and  the  flying  host  of  the  Trojans, 
Who  in  their  city  at  length  are  safe,  while  here  thou  art  wand'ring  • 
Nor  canst  thou  hope  to  lay  me  low,  by  nature  immortal." 
Burning  with  wrath,  thus  answered  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles  : 
"  Now,  of  a  truth,  far-darting  King  !  much  wrong  hast  thou  done  me, 
Leading  me  thus  astray  from  the  walls ;  unkind  and  ungracious  ! 
Else  had  full  many  a  Trojan  bit  the  dust,  and  in  Ilion 
Refuge  had  failed  to  find.     Thou  hast  robbed  me  thus  of  my  glory. 
Lightly,  at  little  cost,  hast  thou  saved  them;  nought  from  my  ven- 
geance

[Book  XXII. 


Fearing   thyself.     But   were   mine   the   pow'r,    this   wrong   would  I 
punish."  (20) 

Thus  he  spake,  and  indignant  his  steps  retraced  to  the  city, 
Hast'ning  his  course  :  like  some  proud  steed,  accustomed  to  triumphs, 
Easily  whirling  on  in  the  race  his  victorious  chariot. 
Plying  his  active  limbs  thus  rushed  Achilles  to  battle. 

Priam,  with  eyes  undimmed  by  age,  beheld  him  advancing, 
Shining  refulgent  in  arms  o'er  the  plain ;  like  the  star  that  in  autumn, 
Earliest  and  brightest  of  all  the  host  that  bespangle  the  heavens, 
Fresh,  as  in  vigorous  youth,  shines  forth  in  the  evening  twilight : — 
That  fierce  star  which  follows  and  dogs  the  steps  of  Orion, 
Bright,  but  of  lurid  and  baleful pow V  ;  announcer  of  evil,  (30) 

Shedding  on  hapless  mortals  diseases,  plagues,  and  disasters : 
Thus  on  his  form,  as  he  darted  along,  bright  glittered  his  armour. 
Heavily  groaned  the  hoary  sire,  and  his  head  in  his  anguish 
Smote  with  his  upraised  hands,  and  in  agony  called  from  the  rampart, 
Praying,  entreating  his  much-lov'd  son ;  who  had  taken  his  station 
Outside  the  gates,  with  eager  desire  to  encounter  Achilles. 
Thus  then  in  piteous  words,  and  with  outstretched   arms,  he  con- 
jured him : 
"  Hector  !  my  son  !  my  belov'd  !  for  the  sake  of  thy  father  await  not 
Thus  unsupported,  that  dreadful  man  :  or  thy  fate  is  decided. 
Mightier  by  far  than  thyself,  ajidfar  more  fierce,  is  Achilles.  (40) 

Wretch  !  O  would  he  were  lov'd  no  more  by  the  blessed  immortals, 
Than  by  myself !  full  soon  would  dogs  and  vultures  devour  him 
There  on  the  field ;  and  appease  the  grief  that  gnaws  at  my  heart- 
strings : 
Grief  Tor  the  many  and  valiant  sons  of  whom  he  has  robbed  me, 
Slaughtered,  or  sold  into  distant  isles  in  fetters  and  bondage. 
Two  of  my  sons,  e'en  now,  Lycaon  and  brave  Polydorus, 
Vainly  I  seek,  among  all  our  host  taking  refuge  in  Ilion; 
Two,  of  one  mother,  Laothoe,  born,  most  queenly  of  women. 
These,  if  they  yet  survive,  though  as  captives  held,  may  I  ransom. 
Gold  in  plenty  and  brass  I  possess,  stored  up  in  my  palace,  (50) 

Which  for  a  dowry  illustrious  Altes  gave  with  his  daughter. 
But,  if  they  both  have  passed  to  the  darksome  mansion  of  Hades, 


Book  XXII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  477 

Hard  will  it  be  to  bear,  to  myself  and  the  mother  that  bore  them  : 
But,  for  their  country,  a  less  enduring  cause  of  affliction 
Than  were  thy  fall,  by  the  slaught'ring  hand  of  dreadful  Achilles. 
Come  then,  my  son,  within  the  wall :  for  the  sake  of  the  Trojans, 
Matrons  and  men,  if  not  for  thine  own;  nor  give  to  Peleides 
This  last  crowning  glory — to  rob  thy  Troy  of  her  Heel  or. 
Oh !    too,  have  pity  on  me,  who  still  survive  but  to  suffer 
All  the  extremes  of  ill ;  whom  Zeus  hath  dragged  to  the  dreary     (60) 
Threshold  of  age  but  to  make  me  a  mark  for  fate,  and  to  witness 
Woes  upon  woes :  my  slaughtered  sons,  my  daughters,  with  outrage 
Torn  from  their  homes ;  their  chambers  sacked,  their  innocent  children 
Dashed  on  the  ground  in  the  merciless  rage  of  wanton  destruction ; 
All  the  fair  brides  of  my  sons  dragged  off  for  slaves  by  the  Grecians. 
Me  too  (perhaps  the  last  to  fall)  or  pierced  by  a  jav'lin, 
Or  by  the  sword  struck  down,  from  my  limbs  when  life  hath  departed, 
Dogs  that  have  fed  from  my  table  and  watched  at  the  gates  of  my 

palace 
Haply  shall  tear  in  the  street  before  my  door ;  and,  my  life-blood 
Lapping,  and  gorged  with  their  impious  meal,  in  the  madness  of  riot  (70) 
Growling,  lie  in  the  porch.     To  the  young,  who  fall  in  the  battle 
Fighting,  though  pierced  with  hostile  steel,  each  wound  is  becoming. 
Beauteous  in  death  they  lie,  each  grace  by  glory  exalted, 
But  when  the  hoary  head  and  the  snow-white  beard  of  the  aged 
Lie,  and  his  withered  limbs,  for  dogs  to   defile  and  to  mangle, 
This  is  the  foulest  sight  that  human  mis'ry  can  offer." 
Thus  spake  the  aged  king,  and  the  hoary  locks  from  his  temples 
Plucked  with  his  hands  and  tore  them   away :   but  persuaded   not 

He&amp;or. 
Hecuba  next,  his  mother  dear,  der  the  battlement  leaning, 
Wild  with   alarm,  and  drowned  in   tears,  appeared,  and  addressed 

him,  (80) 

Baring  her  breasts,  and  pointing  with  either  hand  to  her  bosom  : 
"  Look  upon  these,  O  Hector,  my  son  !    and  pity  thy  mother ! 
If  I  have  fed  thee  hence,  and  lulled  thee  to  sleep  on  my  bosom, 
Think  upon  that,  my  child !    Avoid  this  dreadful  encounter. 
Here,  by  the  walls  secured,  repel  thy  foe;   but  advance  not.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER 


[Book  XXII. 


Wretch  !  should  he  take  thy  life,  'twill  ne'er  be  mine  to  compose  thee 
Decent  upon  thy  bier,  or  to  weep  o'er  thee,   fruit  of  my  travail ! 
Nor  will  thy  rich-dow'r'd  wife  thy  rites  attend.     But,  dishonoured, 
Far  from  us  all,  at  the  Grecians'  ships  their  dogs  will  devour  thee." 
Thus  lamenting  aloud  they  called  on  their  son,  with  entreaties       (90) 
Many  and  vain;  for  Hector's  mind  was  fixed,  and  he  stirred  not 
Though  with  gigantic  strides  he  beheld  Achilles  approaching. 
As  when  a  snake  in  his  mountain  lair  perceives  an  intruder, 
Nurtured  on  poisonous  herbs  with  venom  he  swells,  and  his  eyeballs 
Spitefully  glare,  as  coiled  in  a  knot  he  awaits  his  opponent. 
Hector  thus  with  courage  unshaken  held  his  position, 
Leaning  his  splendid  shield  on  the  buttress  wall  of  the  rampart ; 
Thus,  as  he  stood,  with  his  own  undaunted  spirit  communing : 
aLet  me  be  firm!    If  now  our  walls  and  gates  I  should  enter, 
There  Polydamas  first  shall  I  meet,  who  will  blame  and  reproach  me, 
Calling  to  mind  the  advice  he  gave  to  retreat  to  the  city,       (10 1) 
Only  this  very  night,  when  Achilles  arose  in  his  anger. 
That  I  refused.     But  now  T  see,  to  comply  had  been  better. 
How  should  I  face  the  Trojans,  and  long-robed  matrons  of  Troia, 
Now  that  my  vent'rous  daring  hath  cost  the  lives  of  so  many  ? 
How  could  I  bear  the  comments  of  far  inferior  persons? 
' Hector'  (I hear  them  say)  'has  destroyed  the  state  by  his  rashness.' 
Thus  will  they  taunt  me.     Better  by  far  'twould  he  for  my  honour, 
Meeting  him  here,  Achilles  to  slay,  and  re-enter  in  triumph, 
Or  be  myself  struck  down  and  gloriously  die  for  my  country,    (no) 
Say  I  shall  I  toss  aside  my  round-bossed  shield  from  my  shoulder, 
Doff  my  proud  helm,  and  lean  my  recreant  lance  on  the  rampart ; 
Thus,  unai'med,  before  royal  Achilles  advance,  and  salute  hi?n, 
Proffer  him  Helen's  return  with  all  her  wealth,  and  the  treasures 
Countless,  all  Alexandros  brought  in  his  ships  from  Achaia 
Hither  to  Troy  to  restore  (dire  cause  of  all  our  contention) 
To  the  Atreidse; — and  offer,  moreover,  all  our  possessions, 
All  our  city  contains,  with  the  Greeks  to  share  ;  and  our  princes 
Offer  to  bind  by  oath  to  conceal  no  part,  but  divide  it, 
Fairly  and  justly  in  equal  lots  for  the  Greeks  and  the  Trojans, —  (120) 
All  o\ir  wealth,  and  all  that  adorns  our  beautiful  city? 


Book  XXII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  479 

Why  doth  my  soul  however  suggest  so  hopeless  a  counsel? 
Let  me  not  think  of  meeting  him  thus  !    At  once  would  he  slay  me 
Pitiless.     Once  deprived  of  my  arms,  like  a  woman,  defenceless, 
Shame  nor  respect  would  hold  his  hand.     On  the  spot  would  he 

kill  me. 
Ours  were  no  friendly  talk,  no  calm  familiar  gossip 
Such  as  a  youth  and  a  maid  may  hold  when  they  meet  one  another. 
Youth  meeting  maid  beneath  an  oak  or  a  rock,  and  conversing. 
Better  to  fight  it  out,  and  have  done  :  that  Zeus  may  determine  (129) 
Soon,  and  the  world  may  know  for  whom  the  triumph  is  destined." 

Thus  while  he  pondered,  near  and  nearer  Achilles  approached  him. 
Ares  himself  he  seemed,  with  his  plume  and  warrior  helmet ; 
Poising,  upheld  o'er  his  shoulder,  the  dreadful  Pelian  jav'lin ; 
While  from  his  arms  of  brass  refulgent  streamed  forth  a  splendour 
Bright  as  the  blazing  flame,  or  the  rising  sun  in  his  glory. 

Hector  perceived,  and  seized  with  a  sudden  panic  of  terror, 
Dared  not  remain,  but  fled,  and  the  gates  behind  him  relinquished. 
After  him  dashed  Peleides  fierce,  on  his  fleetness  relying. 
As  when  a  falcon,  swiftest  of  birds,  sweeps  down  from  the  mountains 
Chasing  a.  timid  dove,  and  easily  thinks  to  o'ertake  her,  (I4°) 

Darting  oblique  she  eludes  his  pounce;  yet  nearer  and  nearer, 
Screaming  shrill,  with  repeated  bursts,  he  presses  his  victim : 
So  with  the  swiftness  of  eager  hate  he  followed :  but  Hector 
Put  forth  his  strength  and  in  terror  fled,  in  sight  of  the  Trojans, 
Under  their  wall,  and  beneath  the  watch-tow'r  high, — by  the  fig-tree 
Waving  in  air,   and  along  the  road  in  front  of  the  ramparts. 
Now  near  the  lovely  founts  they  pass,  where  close  to  each  other 
Two  bright  springs  supply  the  eddying  stream  of  Scamander; 
This  pouring  forth  a  tepid  stream,  whose  vapour  around  it 
Steaming  ascends  and  blots  the  air  like  smoke  from  a  furnace;    (150) 
That  in  the  summer's  glow  retaining  the  cold  of  the  winter, 
Chill  as  the  hail,  or  the  drifting  snow,  or  the  ice  on  the  water. 
There  in  broad  basins  of  marble  fair,  one  close  to  the  other, 
Each  from  its  own  clear  spring  supplied,  the  matrons  of  Troia 
Came,  with  their  daughters,  in  peaceful  times  ere  Greece  around  Ilion 
Mustered  in  arms,  to  lave  their  rich  and  beauteous  garments.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXII. 


These  in  their  course  they  passed,  one  flying,  the  other  pursuing. 

Brave  was  the  warrior  who  fled,  but  braver  still  the  pursuer. 

Nor  was  the  contest  then  for  a  vulgar  prize — for  a  victim 

Or  for  a  hide — rewards  of  men  who  contend  in  a  foot-race;    (160) 

But  for  the  life  of  Hector,  the  mighty  defe?ider  of  lilon. 

And,  as  in  honour  of  some  great  chief  deceased,  at  whose  fun'ral 

Horses  with  chariots  run  for  some  rich  prize — for  a  tripod, 

Or  for  a  beauteous  dame — they  stretch  their  speed  to  the  utmost, 

Whirling  around  the  goal :  so  round  the  city  of  Priam 

Thrice  with  unwearied  feet  they  ran ;  while,  leaning  from  heaven, 

Looked  down  the  gods.     Then  spake  the  Father  of  gods  and  of 

mortals : 
"Oh!  what  a  sight  is  this!    Can  I  see  so  noble  a  hero, 
Dear    to    my   heart,   thus   chased   round   the   wall,   nor   melt   with 

compassion  ? 
Many  and  large  are  the  gifts  which  Hector  hath  heaped  on  mine  altars, 
Or  upon  Ida's  rifted  heights,  or  in  Ilion's  temples,  i^1) 

High  on  her  holiest  hill.    Yet  now  by  mighty  Achilles 
Thus  we  behold  him  hunted  around  the  city  of  Priam ! 
Therefore,  ye  gods  !  consult,  and  well  consider  the  issue. 
Say !  shall  we  snatch  him  from  death,  or  at  length  deliver  him  over, 
Brave  as  he  is,  to  be  slain  by  Peleus'  son — by  Achilles?" 
Thus  in  reply  returned  the  blue-eyed  goddess,  Athene : 
"What  hast  thou  said,    great   lord  of  the  lightning's  bolt  and  the 

tempest  ? 
Wouldst    thou    then    rescue   from   death,    long   since   foretold   and 

predestined, 
Heclor,  a  mortal,  marked  by  fate  for  speedy  destruction?  (^o) 

Do  so !  but  think  not  that  I  or  the  other  gods  will  award  it." 
Then  in  his  turn  responded  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion : 
"Be  of  good  cheer,  Tritonia  my  child  !    The  words  that  I  uttered 
Were  but  to  try  thee :  nought  against  fate  resolved.   I  shall  grant  thee 
All  thou  desirest.    Up  !  and  be  doing.    Delay  it  no  longer." 
Then  by  his  words  encouraged,  and  eager  for  action,  Athene' 
Rose,  and  to  earth  plunged  headlong  down  from  the  peaks  of  Olympus. 
Swift  Achilles  the  while  unceasingly  pressed  upon  Hector. 


Book  XXII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


As  when  a  hound,  accustomed  to  chase  the  deer  in  the  mountains, 
Rouses  a  fawn  from  his  lair  and  through  glens  and  thickets  pursues  him, 
What  though  he  crouch  with  fear  and   hide  himself  deep  in    the 
copse  wood,  (I9I) 

Followed  and  tracked,  once  more  he  flies  and  abandons  his  covert : 
Thus  could  not  Hector  evade  the  keen  pursuit  of  Achilles. 
Oft  as  he  strove  to  approach  the  Dardan  gates,  and  for  shelter 
Run  within  range  of  the  darts  and  spears  hurled  down  from  the 

ramparts, 
Lofty,  and  lifted  with  his  friends,  so  oft  his  eager  pursuer 
Ev'ry  attempt  forestalled,  and  turned  him  aside  from  the  city, 
Holding  his  own  swift  course  betwixt  his  foe  and  the  Trojans. 
Thus  it  seems  in  a  dream,  when  with  toil  and  labour  we  follow 
One  who  seems  close  at  hand,  yet  advances  not,   nor  can  we  reach 
him :  •  (200) 

Thus  neither  one  on  his  foe  could  gain,  nor  the  other  escape  him. 
How,    even    then,    could    Hector   have   shunned   black   death   and 

destruction, 
Had  not  still,  to  the  very  last,  his  guardian  Apollo 
Come  to  his  aid,   and  strengthened  his  knees,  and  sustained  him 
in  vigour? 

Swift  as  they  passed,  Peleides  signed  to  the  Greeks  that  at  Hector 
None  should  presume  to  aim,  or  the  biting  shaft,  or  the  jav'lin, 
Lest  by  that  hand  he  should  fall,  and  Achilles  be  second  in  glory. 

Now  for  the  fourth  time  passed  they  the  fountains  twain  :  and 
the  Father 
Hung  forth  the  golden  balance  that  weighs  the  issues  of  battle ; 
Placed  in  itsscales  the  fates  of  each,  the  grave  and  its  slumbers,  (210) 
This  for  Achilles,  that  for  Hector,  subduer  of  coursers; 
These  he  poised,  and  the  scale,  with  Hector's  destiny  loaded, 
Sank  to  the  realms  of  night.     Then  Phoebus  Apollo  forsook  him. 

Now  to  Achilles  came  the  blue-eyed  Goddess  Athene, 
Taking  her  station  close  to  his  side,  and  thus  she  addressed  him  : 
"Glorious  Peleides!   fav'rite  of  Zeus  !   the  hour  is  impending 
When,  in  the  presence  of  all  the  Greeks,  in  front  of  their  vessels, 
Hector,  insatiate  of  war,  we  shall  slay,  great  glory  achieving.

[Book  XXII. 


Now  no  means  of  escape  remain,  no  hope  of  evasion, 
Not,  should  Phcebus  Apollo  himself  at  the  feet  of  the  Thund'rer  (220) 
Prostrate  fall,  and  beg  for  his  life  with  tears  and  entreaties. 
Stay  where  thou  art,  and  recover  thy  breath.     Myself  will  to  Hector 
Speed,  and  persuade  him  to  turn  from  flight,  and  meet  thee  in  combat." 
Thus  she  spake.     Rejoicing  he  heard,  and  his  course  he  arrested. 
Leaning  he  stood  on  his  brazen-pointed  Pelian  jav'lin. 
Quitting  him,  godlike  Hector  Athene'  sought,  and  approached  him, 
Taking  Deiphobus'  form  and  sonorous  voice;  and  beside  him 
Standing,  thus  in  encouraging  words  addressed  him  the  Goddess : 
" Surely,  my  brother,  swift  Achilles  presses  thee  sorely! 
Sad  is  it  thus  to  behold  thee  chased  round  the  city  of  Priam.  (230) 

Now  let  us  make  a  stand,  and  with  force  united  await  him. 

Crest-waving  Hector  g7-atefnl  heard,  and  thus  he  responded  : 
"Oh  !   my  Deiphobus,  ever  by  far  most  lov'd  of  my  brethren, 
Dearest  of  all  whom  Hecuba's  love  to  my  father  hath  given  ! 
Now  more  lov'd,  more  honoured  than  ever  before,  to  assist  me 
Since  thou  hast  ventured  forth  from  the  walls  so  soon  as  thou  saw'st 

me 
Thus  bested,  while  the  rest  within  lie  stricken  with  panic." 

Him  thus  answered  in  turn  the  blue-eyed  goddess  Athene  : 
"  Much  did  our  father  and  mother  revered  beseech,  O  my  brother, 
Much   did   they  urge   me   to   stay,    embracing  my  knees;   and   my 
kinsmen  (240) 

Each  after  each  :  such  dread  upon  all  had  seized.    But  within  me 
Grief  a?id  distress  all  fear  overcame,  and  drove  me  to  aid  thee. 
Now  let  us  make  a  stand  and  fight,  nor  longer  inactive 
Suffer  our  spears  to  remain.     Let  us  see  whether  really  Achilles 
Both  will  slay,  and  strip  off  our  bloody  spoils,  and  as  trophies 
Bear  them  away  to  his  ships,  or  yield  his  life  to  thy  jav'lin." 

Thus,  deceitful,  she  spake,  while  leading  him  on  to  destruction. 
Now,  as  the  heroes  approached  and  were  rapidly  nearing  each  other, 
Crest-waving  Hector  took  the  word,  addressing  Achilles: 
"Now  have  I  done  with  flight,  Peleides  !   Enough  round  the  city  (250) 
Thrice  to  have  run  in  dread,  nor  have  dared  to  turn  and  to  face  thee 
And  thy  assault  sustain.     But  now  the  spirit  within  me 


Book  XXII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  483 

Prompts  me  to  stand  and  resist.     X'ow  one  must  fall  or  the  other. 
Yet  let  us  swear,  and  raise  our  eyes  to  the  blessed  immortals 
W  no  from  above  look  down  on  oaths,  and  call  them  to  witness  : 
Never,  should  I  survive  the  fight — thy  life  be  the  forfeit — 
Will  I  -dishonour  thee,  dead,  or  commit  one  outrage  upon  thee; 
Only  thy  beauteous  arms  from  thy  bosom  strip,  for  a  trophy ; 
Then  to  the  Greeks  restore  thy  corse.    Thus  promise,  Achilles  '. " 

Scowling  upon  him  with  baleful  frown  thus  answered  Achilles  :  (260) 
"Hector  accurs'd  '.  talk  not  to  me  of  agreements  and  compacts ; 
Leagues  there  are  none  'twixt  lions  and  men.  nor  solemn  conventions  ; 
Pacts  betwixt  wolves  and  sheep ;  but  enmity  fierce  and  eternal, 
Thorough  and  rancorous  hate,  all  ills  devising  and  acting. 
Such  and  such  only  the  pact  I  can  make  with  thee  :  nor  between  us 
Faith  can  we  plight,  till  death  shall  seize  on  one  or  the  other, 
And  with  his  blood  the  slain  shall  appease  insatiate  Ares. 
Summon  thy  courage  then,  and  thy  utmost  force.    Thou  wilt  need 

them, — 
All  thou  canst  do  with  sword  and  spear,  as  a  man  and  a  warrior. 
Now,  be  assured,  thou  hast  no  escape,  since  Pallas  Athene    (270) 
Gives  thee  at  length  to  my  spear ;  and  the  woes  thou  hast  wrought 

to  the  Argives — 
All  my  companions  slain — cry  out  for  vengeance  upon  thee." 

Ending,  he  poised,  then  hurled  his  long-forth-shadowing  javlin. 
Hector  however  perceived  it  in  flight,  and  bent  to  avoid  it, 
Kneeling  down  when  he  saw  its  approach ;  and  o'er  him  the  weapon 
Flew,  and  in  earth  stood  fixed.     Forth  snatched  it  Pallas  Athene, 
All  unperceived  by  Hector,  and  handed  it  back  to  Achilles. 
Thus  then  Hector  addressed  th'  illustrious  offspring  of  Peleus : 
"Godlike  and  bi'ave  as  thou  art,  Peleides  !  lo  !  thou  hast  missed  me : 
Nor  was  my  fate  so  surely  revealed  by  Zeus  as  thou  fanciedst.      (280) 
Think  not  by  empty  words,  how  boastful  soe'er,  to  dismay  me, 
Shake  my  courage  and  strength,  or  make  me  dread  thy  encounter. 
Nor  shall  thy  spear  o"ertake  a  flying  foe.    I  shall  meet  it, 
If  I  be  destined  by  Heav'n  to  fall,  unflinching  and  bravely, 
Struck  through  the  breast.     Xow  avoid,  if  thou   canst,  the  spear   I 

shall  send  thee.

[Book  XXII. 


Brazen  and  sharp.    May  it  find  deep  resting-place  in  thy  bosom ! 
So  shall  an  easier  task  to  the  Trojans  remain  in  their  struggle, 
Freed  by  thy  death  of  their  direst  foe — thou  scourge  of  our  nation  !" 

Ending,  he  poised,  then  hurled  his  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin. 
Full  on  Peleides'  shield  it  alighted,  just  in  the  centre,  (29°) 

True  to  its  aim;   but  it  bounded  off,  repelled  by  the  buckler. 
Hector  with  rage  and  grief  beheld  the  recoil  of  his  weapon. 
Sore  dejected  he  stood.    No  second  spear  was  provided. 
Vainly  De'iphobus'  snow-white  shield  he  sought,  and  upon  him 
Called  aloud  for  another  lance.     No  brother  was  near  him. 
Then  in  his  mind  he  perceived  the  deceit ;  thus  sadly  exclaiming  : 
"Woe  to  me  now  !  the  gods  have  decreed  my  death.   I  am  summoned ! 
Surely  methought  I  beheld  De'iphobus  standing  beside  me  ! 
'Twas  but  a  phantom  by  Pallas  raised :  he  is  safe  in  the  city. 
Now  is  an  evil  death  at  hand:  no  way  to  escape  it: —  (300) 

None  !  though  of  old  not  thus  had  Zeus  or  Phoebus  Apollo 
Left  me  to  perish — ever  at  hand,  and  ever  propitious, 
Ready  to  save,  whatever  befel.    Now  fate  overtakes  me  ! 
Yet  will  I  not  inglorious  sink,  nor  die  like  a  coward. 
Some  great  deed  will  I  do  that  future  ages  shall  hear  of." 

Thus  having  said,  his  trenchant  sword  he  drew  from  its  scabbard, 
Where  by  his  side,  huge,  heavy,  and  strong,  from  his  loins  it  depended ; 
Then  with  collected  might  he  rushed  on  his  foe.    As  an  eagle 
Soaring  aloft,  from  his  home  in  the  dark-rolling  clouds,  on  the  meadow 
Swoops,  when  he  clutches  a  lamb  or  tim'rous  hare  in  his  talons,      (310) 
Hector  with  brandished  blade  thus  fiercely  rushed  on  Achilles. 
He  too  came  on,  with  rage  immense  in  his  bosom  concentered; 
P  urious  :  his  fair  and  rich-wrought  shield  pressed  close  to  his  corslet. 
High  on  his  head,  with  four-fold  cone,  his  glittering  helmet 
Nodded  in  crested  pride.    Bright  waved,  close-tufted,  and  gleaming 
Threads  of  resple?ident  gold  by  Hephaestus  mixed  with  its  plumage. 
Bright  as  the  fair  Hesperian  star  shining  forth  in  the  ev'ning, 
Fairest  and  brightest  of  all  the  stars  that  glance  in  the  heaveas, 
Sparkled  the  point  of  the  Pelian  spear,  which  godlike  Achilles 
Shook   with   his   strong  right   hand,   as   advancing   he   glared  upon 
Hector,  (320) 


Book  XXII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  485 

Eying  him  well  to  espy  some  place  where  best  he  might  wound  him. 
All  was  compact,  for  the  arms  he  had  torn  from  slaughtered  Patroclus, 
Beauteous  and  brazen,  fitted  him  close,  nor  permitted  an  entry- 
Save  at  the  place  where  the  collar-bone  unites  to  the  shoulder, 
Just  at  the  point  most  dang'rous  to  life,  was  the  neck  undefended. 
This  Achilles  perceived,  and  eagerly  springing  upon  him, 
Drove  through  his  tender  neck  the  piercing  point  of  his  jav'lin. 
Straight   through   passed  the  pond'rous  spear,  but  pierced  not  the 

windpipe, 
Leaving  him  still  the  pow'r  of  speech,  nor  stifling  his  utt'rance. 
Prostrate  he  rolled  in  the  dust,  while  o'er  him  vaunted  Achilles  :  (330) 
"Hector!   thou    thought'st    thyself   safe   when   thou    stripp'dst   the 

spoils  of  Patroclus  : 
Far  away  was  his  friend,  and  thou  took'st  no  thought  of  the  absent. 
Fool !  to  forget  that  there  in  the  hollow  ships  an  avenger 
Mightier  by  far  was  at  hand,  and  that  I  remained  to  requite  thee. 
Now  art  thou  fall  11.     There  lie,  to  be  torn  by  dogs  and  by  vultures 
Limb  from  limb,  while  the  Greeks  with  pomp  shall  bury  Patroclus." 

Gasping  for  breath,  and  in  feeble  tones,  great  Hector  responded: 
"Now  by  thy  life! — by  thy  knees  which  L  clasp! — by  the  love  of  thy 

parents ! 
Suffer  me  not,  I  entreat,  by  the  Grecian  dogs  to  be  mangled. 
Ransom  accept,  which  my  father  and  honoured  mother  will  offer. 
Brass,   and  abundant  gold,  and  priceless  gifts,  if,  relenting,  (34 1) 

Home  thou  wilt  only  send  my  lifeless  corse,  that  the  Trojans 
And  the  sad  matrons  of  Troy  may  rear  my  pyre,  and  consume  it." 

Scowling  upon  him  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles : 
"  Talk  not  of  knees  embraced  in  pray'r — of  my  life — or  my  parents, 
Dog!    But  that  nature  recoils,  methinks  I  myself  could  devour  thee 
Raw,  cutting   off  thy  flesh  from  thy  bones.     Such  woes   hast   thou 

wrought  me. 
No!    Not  a  man  shall  approach  to  drive  the  dogs  from  thy  carcase; 
Not,  should  they  bring  me  tenfold,  twentyfold  ransom  to  buy  thee  ; 
Not    should    they  place   it  before   me,   and    promise   more — their 
possessions  (35°) 

All,  and  the  wealth  of  Troy.     No!  not  should  Dardanian  Priam 


486 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXII. 


Coin  himself  into  gold.     O'er  thy  bier  the  mother  that  bore  thee 
Weeping  shall  never  bend,  and  thy  limbs  compose.     But  the  vultures 
Wild  and  devouring  dogs  shall  mangle  and  tear  thee  to  pieces." 

He 61  or  with  faint  and  dying  voice  this  answer  returned  him : 
"This  might  I  well  have  foreseen,  for  I  know  thee  well.   To  persuasion 
'Tis  not  thy  nature  to  yield;  for  a  heart  of  steel  is  within  thee. 
This  wilt  thou  rue,  that  day  when  the  wrath  of  the  gods  shall  be 

kindjed 
'Gainst  thee,  on  my  account;  when  Paris  and  Phoebus  Apollo, 
Brave  as  thou  art,  at  the  Scsean  gate  with  their  arrows  shall  stretch 
thee."  (360) 

Thus  while  he  spake  the  shades  of  death  came  gath'ring  around  him. 
Quitting  his  mortal  frame  his  soul  passed  downward  to  Hades 
Wailing  its  lot,  relinquishing  youth  and  vigour  and  manhood. 
Peleus'  son  stood  o'er  him  awhile,  and  addressed  the  departed : 
"Die  thou  first !    For  myself,  I  accept  my  fate,  when  it  pleases 
Zeus  and  the  other  immortal  gods  that  Achilles  shall  perish." 

Thus  having  said,  his  brazen  spear  from  the  dead  he  extracted, 
Laid  it  aside,  and  stripped  the  blood-stained  spoils  from  his  shoulders ; 
Round  him  on  all  sides  gathered  in  crowds  the  sons  of  Achaia, 
Much  admiring  the  beauteous  form  and  the  stature  of  Hector.     (370) 
Nor  did  a  man  approach  but  inflicted  a  wound  on  the  hero; 
Each  to  his  neighbour  thus  addressing  words  of  derision : 
"Hector  behold!  far  gentler,  softer,  and  easier  to  deal  with 
Than  when  he  hurled  in  his  rage  devouring  names  on  our  vessels." 
Thus,  as  he  spurned  at  the  corpse,   each   Greek   exclaimed  to  his 
fellow. 

Godlike  Achilles  had  now  despoiled  the  dead,  and  advancing 
Full  in  the  midst  of  the  Greeks,  in  words  like  these  he  harangued 

them : 
"  Friends,  and  leaders  of  Greece!  her  foremost  in  war  and  m  council! 
Now  that  by  heav'n's  propitious  aid  we  have  conquered  the  warrior 
Who  beyond  all  the  rest  of  his  race  afflicted  our  armies,         (380) 
Up!  and  around  the  city  in  arms  let  us  march,  and  discover 
What  the  Trojans  intend — what  further  course  they  contemplate : 
Whether,  their  hero  slain,  they  will  yield  their  town  and  surrender, 


Book  XXII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  487 

Or,  undismayed  by  his  loss,  will  still  prolong  their  resistance. 
Why  will  my  soul  however  thus  lead  me  on  with  suggestions? 
There  at  the  ships  Patroclus  lies,  unwept  and  unburied; 
Whom,  while  on  earth  I  remain  endued  with  vigour  and  manhood, 
Mixing  with  living  men,  my  soul  shall  not  cease  to  remember. 
Ev'n  in  the  shades,  where  living  and  dead  alike  are  forgotten, 
There,   even  there,  my  lov'd  companion's  remembrance  will  haunt 
me.  (390) 

Back  to  our  ships  return  we  then,  ye  youths  of  Achaia, 
Bear  with  us  Hector's  corpse,  and  chant  this  Paean  in  chorus: 
1  Glory  and  triumph  are  ours !  We  have  slain  the  redoubtable  Hector, 
Worshipped  no  less  than  a  god,  as  their  city's  stay,  by  the  Trojans.'" 

This  having  said,  an  unseemly  deed  he  devised  against  Hector. 
Boring  the  tendons  behind  of  his  feet,  from  the  heel  to  the  ankle, 
Thongs  of  leather  he  passed  through  both,  and  tied  them  together ; 
Then  to  his  chariot  bound;  while  the  head  lay  trailing  behind  them ; 
Mounted  the  car,  and,  receiving  the  glorious  spoils  from  his  comrades, 
Lashed   the   steeds,  and  with  right  good  will  they  whirled   on   the 
chariot.  (400) 

Up  rose  the  dust  in  clouds  as  they  dragged  the  corse;  and  behind  it 
Streamed   out  the   long  dark  locks;  and  with   dust  that  head  was 

disfigured, 
Ever  before  so  graceful  and  fair:  for  by  Zeus  was  he  destined 
Thus,  on  his  own  paternal  soil,  to  defilement  and  outrage. 

Now  when  his  mother  beheld  her  son  thus  dragged  and  disfigured, 
Rending  her  hair  she  stood,  and  the  shining  veil  from  her  temples 
Flung  far  away,  and  convulsive  sobs  burst  forth  from  her  bosom. 
Piteously  moaned  his  father  dear,  and  over  the  city 
Loud  and  on  all  sides  rose  the  voice  of  sorrow  and  wailing. 
Seemed  as  if,  toppling  down  from  her  height,  her  glory  departed,  (410) 
Ilion  already  a  prey  to  flames  in  her  ashes  were  sinking. 
Scarce  could  his  people  prevent  their  hoary  monarch  from  rushing, 
Maddened  by  grief  and  despair,  from  the  Dardan  gate  to  Achilles. 
Rolled  in  the  mire  at  length  he  lay,  and  begged,  and  entreated, 
Calling,  adjuring  all  by  name  who  tried  to  restrain  him : 
"  Cease  to  detain  me,  my  friends,  and,  sad  tho'  it  be,  yet  allow  me

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXII. 


Forth  from  the  city  alone  to  go  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
There  to  beseech  this  dreadful  man,  this  ruthless  destroyer : 
Haply  he  yet  may  respect  my  age,  and,  touched  by  compassion, 
Pity  my  hoary  locks.     For  he  too  at  home  has  a  father,         (42°) 
Peleus,  old  and  weak  like  myself,  who  begat  and  who  reared  him, 
Scourge  as  he  is  of  our  race;  but  of  mine  most  bitter  and  cruel. 
Many  a  son  of  mine  in  the  bloom  of  youth  hath  he  slaughtered ; 
Hard  to  endure!  but  of  all  most  dear,  most  deeply  lamented, 
One,  whose  untimely  loss  to  the  grave  with  sorrow  will  bring  me, 
Hector  belov'd!    Ah!  would  in  my  arms  thou  hadst  breathed  forth 

thy  spirit ! 
Tenderly  then  had  I  closed  thine  eyes,  and  wept  and  bewailed  thee. 
Taking  my  fill  of  grief,  with  the  hapless  mother  that  bore  thee." 

Weeping  he  spake,  and  around  him  wept  in  concert  the  Trojans. 
Hecuba  then  in  her  turn,  by  the  Troian  matrons  surrounded,       (430) 
Thus  began:  "O  why  do  I  live,  my  son!  to  lament  thee, 
Pride  of  mine  eyes  and  boast  of  my  lips,  my  joy  and  my  comfort, 
Ever  by  night  and  day?     Sole  hope,  sole  stay  of  the  Trojans, 
Matrons  and  men,  who  as  all  but  a  god  revered  and  adored  thee. 
Living,  in  thee  they  beheld  the  glory  and  strength  of  their  city. 
Now  thou  art  gone  !  and  nought  remains  but  to  grieve,  and  bewail  thee.'1'' 

Weeping  she  spake. — As  yet  no  word  to  the  consort  of  Hector 
Rumour  had  borne ;  no  messenger  sure  had  brought  her  the  tidings 
Dread,  that  without  the  gates  her  lord  awaited  Achilles. 
High  in  a  chamber  remote,  beneath  the  roof  of  her  palace,    (440) 
Plied  she  the  loom,  in  the  close-wrought  web  rich  figures  embroid'ring, 
Beauteous.    Anon  she  called  to  the  fair-haired  maidens  around  her, 
Bidding  them  place  on  the  fire  a  tripod  vast;  that,  from  battle 
Hector  returning,  might  find  prepared  a  bath  to  refresh  him. 
Blind  to  the  fates  !  nor  knew  she  that  far  from  baths  or  attendance 
Blue-eyed  Athena  her  hero  had  slain  by  the  hands  of  Achilles. 
Suddenly  struck  on  her  ear  the  shrieks  and  wails  from  the  rampart. 
O'er  her  a  faintness  came,  and  the  shuttle  dropped  from  her  fingers, 
As  to  her  fair-haired  maidens  her  boding  feai-s  she  imparted  : 
"Two  of  you  come  with  me  !     I  must  hence,   and  see  what  has 
happened.  (450) 


Book  XXI L]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  489 

That  was  our  mothers  shriek  I  heard !    The  heart  in  my  bosom 
Leaps  to  my  throat,  and  my  knees,  benumbed,  seem  sinking  beneath 

me. 
Surely  o'er  Priam's  house,  and  his  sons,  some  mischief  is  pending  ! 
Far  be  the  word,  oh  I  far  from  mine  ear  !    But  I  dread  lest  Achilles, 
Cutting  my  Hector  off  from  all  retreat  to  the  city, 
Press  him  alone  to  the  plain.    How  fatal  would  then  be  the  courage 
Urging  him  on  ! — who  ne'er  behind  in  the  crowd  of  the  warriors 
Ling'ring,  brooked  to  remain  ;  but  ever,  the  first  of  the  foremost, 
Sprang  to  the  fight,  and  thought  it  shame  to  be  equalled  in  valour." 

Thus  having  said,  like  one  distraught  she  rushed  through  the  palace  : 
Thick    beat    her    heart.— Her    attendants    followed,    close    on   her 

footsteps ;  (461) 

Soon  to  the   tow'r   she    came,    and   pushed   through   the  crowd   to 

the  rampart, 
Cast  o'er  the  walls  a  distracted  glance ;  and  there  she  perceived  him 
Dragged  o'er  the  plain  in  front  of  the  town ;  and  swiftly  the  horses 
Hurrying  away  the  car,  she  beheld,  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians. 
That  when  she  saw,  the  darkness  of  night  settled  down  on  her  eyelids ; 
Back  she  sank  in  a  swoon,  and  at  once  her  senses  forsook  her. 
Loose    from    her    head    fell    scattering    the    beauteous    bands    that 

adorned  it, 
Garland  and  coronal  fair,  the  confining  net,  and  the  fillet 
Twining  among  her  hair,  and  the  veil  which  bright  Aphrodite     (470) 
Flung  o'er  her  head  on  that  happy  day  when  crest-waving  Hector 
Led  her,  a  rich-dower'd  bride,  from  the  halls  of  her  father  Eetion. 
Round  her  her  sisters  had  gathered,  the  gentle  wives  of  her  brothers: 
These  in  their  arms  received,  and  her  fleeting  spirit  arrested. 
Now,  when  again  she  breathed,  and  her  thoughts  once  more  were 

collected, 
Broken  by  sobs,  her  plaint  she  poured  to  the  matrons  of  Troia : 
"Hector!  alas  for  us  both!  to  an  evil  fate  were  we  destined 
Both  from  our  birth :  for  thee,  in  Troy  in  the  palace  of  Priam, 
And  for  myself,  in  the  fair  Hypoplakian  forests,  in  Thebse, 
Under  my  father  Eetion's  roof,  who  begat  and  who  reared  me,  (480) 
Wretched,  a  wretched  child.    Oh !  would  I  had  never  existed  ! 


490  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXII. 

Now  art  thou  passed  away  to  the  gloomy  mansions  of  Hades, 
Down  in  the  depths  of  earth,  and  here  am  I  left  in  thy  palace, 
Widowed  and  plunged  in  grief,  with  our  boy,  so  tender  an  infant, 
Child  of  our  love,  and  of  joys  once  sweet,  now  bitter  to  think  on. 
Him  thou  canst  neither  aid,  nor  can  he  requite  thy  affcclion. 
Should  he  survive  this  dreadful  war,  and  the  sword  of  the  Grecians, 
Trouble  and  toil  henceforth  are  his  bitter  lot,  and  the  stranger 
Ever  encroaching  will  seize  his  fields,  removing  the  landmarks. 
Mournful  his  orphaned  days.  No  young  companions  to  cheer  him,  (490) 
Sad  and  dejected,  his  cheeks  ever  wet  with  tears,  must  he  wander; 
Pinched  by  want  will  he  fly  to  his  father's  friends  and  companions, 
Craving  for  food,  plucking  one  by  the  cloak,  and  one  by  the  tunic. 
Some  one  in  pity,  perchance,  a  cup  of  wine  may  afford  him, 
Hardly  enough  to  moisten  his  lips,  still  leaving  him  thirsty; 
One,  perchance,  who  has  never  known  the  loss  of  a  parent, 
Drives  him  away  from  the  festive  board  with  blows  and  reproaches  : 
1  Get  thee  gone!'  will  he  say,  'Thy  father  feasts  not  among  us.' 
Weeping,  my  child  must  then  return  to  his  mother,  a  widow, — 
He,  my  Astyanax,  fondled  once  on  the  knees  of  his  father,      (500) 
Fed  with  the  choicest  food,  with  the  marrow  of  sheep  and  of  fatlings  : 
Who  when  he  dropped  to  sleep,  with  his  childish  cries  or  his  pastimes 
Wearied,  reposed  in  his  nurse's  arms  on  luxurious  couches, 
Every  want  appeased,  and  wrapt  in  the  softest  of  slumbers. 
Now  must  his  sorrows  begin,  (his-  father  lost)  and  his  suff'rings — 
Hapless  Astyanax !  Prince  of  Troy  !  so  called  by  the  Trojans, 
For  that  thou  only,  my  Heclor  I  their  gates  and  bulwarks  protect edst. 
Now  art  thou  stretched  at  the  Grecian  ships,  afar  from  thy  parents, 
Naked ;  the  worms  destroying  whate'er  the  dogs  may  have  left  them. 
Naked  !  and  here  in  thy  desolate  home  are  robes  in  abundance,    (510) 
Beauteous  and  soft,  all  wrought  by  the  hands  of  those  wrho  adored  thee. 
Now  to  the  flames  I  devote  them  all,  since  never  henceforward 
Or  shall  they  grace  thy  living  limbs,  or,  dead,  shall  enfold  them. 
What  poor  glory  their  flames  may  confer,  the  Trojans  shall  witness." 
Weeping  she  spake,  and  around  her  wept  her  faithful  attendants.

After  a  funeral  feast  in  honour  of  Patroclus,  Achilles  retires  to 
sleep  on  the  sea  shore.  The  ghost  of  Patroclus  appears ;  and  demands  the 
rites  of  burial.  The  funeral  pile  is  prepared.  Patroclus  being  laid  on 
it.  Achilles  sacrifices  his  hair,  then  several  horses  and  other  animals,  and 
lastly  twelve  Trojan  captives.  Iris  summons  the  winds  to  fan  the  flames 
of  the  pyre.  The  corpse  being  consumed,  the  bones  are  gathered  in  an 
urn,  and  a  mound  raised  over  the  place  of  the  pile.  Funeral  games  are 
then  celebrated  by  Achilles,  who  furnishes  and  awards  the  prizes.  With 
the  description  of  these  games  and  their  various  incidents  this  book 
concludes.

'""PHUS  through  the  city  the  voice  of  mourning  rose.     But  the  Gre- 
J-         cians, 
When  they  at  length  their  ships  had  reached,  and  the  Hellespont's 

waters, 
Broke  tip  their  ranks  and  dispersed ;  each  man  to  his  vessel  retiring. 
Godlike  Achilles  however  detained  the  Myrmidon  squadrons, 
Thus  to  his  brave  companions  in  arms  declaring  his  orders  : 
"Comrades,  honoured  and  lov'd  !    ye  car-borne  Myrmidon  warriors  ! 
Loose  not  your  stamping  steeds  from  beneath  the  yokes  of  your 

chariots, 
But  with  your  horses  and  cars  attend.     Approaching  Patroclus, 
Raise  ye  the  fun'ral  wail.     Such  tribute  claims  the  departed. 
When  we  have  thus  indulged  our  grief  in  sad  lamentation,  (10) 

Loose  we  our  wearied  steeds.     Then  all  partake  of  refreshment." 
Thus  having  said,  all  joined  in  the  loud  lament,  by  Achilles 
Led,  while  thrice  round  the  dead  in  slow  procession  the  chariots 
Rolled,  and  while  Thetis  swelled  their  grief,  and  prompted  its  utt'rance, 
Wet  was  the  sand  with  tears  :  with  tears  bedewed  was  their  armour  : 
Such  was  their  yearning  grief  for  a  chief  so  dreaded  in  battle. 
Foremost  of  all  great  Peleus'  son  gave  vent  to  his  anguish, 
Laid  on  the  breast  of  his  friend  his  slaughtering  hands,  and  addressed 

him  : 
u  Shade  ^/"Patroclus,  hail!  In  the  darksome  dwelling  of  Hades

[Book  XXIII. 


This  be  thy  solace,  to  know  that  all  will  be  done  that  I  promised;    (20) 
Hector's  corpse  at  thy  feet  be  cast,  for  dogs  to  devour  it, 
And  that  before  thy  fun'ral  pyre  twelve  youths  of  the  Trojans, 
Nobly  born,  to  avenge  thy  death,  by  these  hands  shall  be  slaughtered." 
Thus  he  spake,  and,  on  Hector's  corpse  foul  outrage  committing, 
Cast  it  forth  at  the  foot  of  Patroclus'  bier,  where  it  prostrate 
Rolled  in  the  dust.     Each  warrior  then  his  glittering  armour 
Doffed,  and  his  neighing  steeds  at  length  released  from  his  chariot. 
Down  by  thousands  the  heroes  sate  at  the  ships  of  Achilles, 
Bid,  one  and  all,  to  partake  of  a  great  funereal  banquet. 
Many  a  milk-white  steer  lay  stretched  by  the  axe,  and  beside  them  (30) 
Sheep  unnumbered  and  bleating  goats  lay  piled  on  each  other; 
Boars,  with  their  iv'ry  tusks  exposed,  on  spits  were  extended, 
Feeding  with  streams  ofidX  the  scorching  flames  of  Hephaestus; 
While  round  the  corse,  as  from  bowls  poured  forth,  flowed  blood  in 

abundance. 
Now  to  Achilles  came  the  princes  and  chiefs  of  the  Argives, 
Pressing  to  lead  him  up  to  Atreides'  tent :   and  he  followed, 
Hardly  persuaded,  in  wrathful  mood  at  the  death  of  his  comrade. 
Soon  as  they  came  to  the  gorgeous  tent  of  King  Agamemnon 
Shrill-voiced  heralds  approached,  and  received  command  from   the 

chieftains, 
Quick  on  the  fire  to  place  a  tripod  vast,  and  besought  him      (40) 
Plunged  in  the  bath  to  efface  from  his  form  the  traces  of  bloodshed. 
This  he  sternly  refused,  and  by  oath  confirmed  his  refusal: 
"No  !   by  all-poiihful  Zeus  I  swear,  supreme  and  immortal, 
Not  till  Patroclus'  rites  be  paid,  and  a  mound  o'er  his  ashes 
Raised,  and  my  locks  shorn  off  be  upon  it  laid,  shall  ablution, 
Cleanse  my  hands  or  approach  my  head  :    for  never  henceforward 
Grief  such  as  this  will  seize  on  my  heart  and  blight  my  existence. 
Yet,  though  abhorring  the  thought  of  food,  will  I  join  in  your  banquet ; 
But  on  the  morrow's  dawn  give  orders,  King  Agamemnon ! 
Wood  from  the  forests  to  bring,  and  arrange,  that  so  the  departed,  (50) 
Soothed  and  appeased,  may  pass  to  the  darksome  shadows  of  Hades. 
So  shall  the  busy  flames  that  dismal  and  piteous  objecl 
Sweep  from  before  our  eyes,  and  our  warriors  return  to  their  duties." 


Book  XXI II.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  495 

Thus  he  spake  :  attentive  they  heard,  and  the  order  was  issued. 
Each  then,  intent,  his  ev'ning  meal  prepared,  and  they  feasted, 
All  to  their  souls'  content,  nor  lacked  there  abundance  or  welcome. 
Then,  when  at  length  the  pangs  of  hunger  and  thirst  were  abated, 
Each  to  his  tent  retired,  and  sought  the  repose  that  he  needed. 

Peleus'  son  on  the  wide-resounding  shore  of  the  ocean 
Cast  him  to  sleep,  with  many  a  groan,  with  his  Myrmidon  warriors,  (60) 
Choosing  a  spot  retired,  where,  soothed  by  the  dash  of  the  breakers, 
Over  his  soul  sweet  sleep  diffused  its  gentle  refreshment, 
Blotting  out  all  his  cares,  and  renewing  his  vigour,  exhausted 
Sorely  by  that  long  chase  round  the  wind-swept  Ilian  fortress. 
There,  as  he-  slept,  before  him  rose  the  ghost  of  Patroclus, 
Mournful,  in  all  things  like,  in  his  beauteous  eyes,  in  his  stature, 
Features,  and  form,  and  voice,  and  the  well-known  sweep  ^/"his  garments : 
Over  his  head  he  stood,  and  solemnly  thus  he  addressed  him : 
"And  dost  thou  sleep,  Achilles  !  forgetting  thy  friend  and  companion? 
Living,  thou  lov'dst  me  well,  but  dead,  behold  me  forgotten !         (70) 
Bury  me  quickly.     Give  me  to  pass  the  portals  of  Hades. 
Thence  do  the  shadows  of  those  who  rest  from  their  labours  repel  me, 
Suff'ring  me  not  to  cross  that  stream,  and  mingle  among  them  : 
So  that,  forlorn,  round  the  wide-expanding  gate  must  I  wander. 
Give  me  thy  hand,  I  beseech  thee  with  tears  :  for  never  henceforward 
Must  I  return,  when  the  fun'ral  flames  are  quenched  on  my  ashes. 
Ne'er  shall  we  more,  as  in  life,  apart  from  our  friends  and  companions, 
Take  sweet  counsel  together  :  for  now,  at  length,  has  the  sentence 
Hateful,  pronounced  by  fate  at  the  hour  of  my  birth,  overta'en  me. 
Like  to  a  God  as  thou  art,  thou  too  art  predestined,  Achilles,        (80) 
Under  these  hostile  walls  to  fall  by  the  hands  of  the  Trojans. 
So  let  me  claim  of  thee  one  thing  more ;  nor  must  thou  refuse  me: 
Let  not  our  bones,  Achilles  !  be  parted  in  death,  but  commingling, 
Rest :  as  together  we  grew  beneath  the  roof  of  thy  father, 
When  to  his  care  by  Mencetius  consigned,  who  brought  me  from  Opus, 
Youth  as  I  was,  from  my  country  driven,  redhanded  with  slaughter, 
On  that  unhappy  day  when  Amphidamas'  son  in  a  quarrel 
Over  our  dice  I  slew ;   not  meaning  harm,  but  in  passion, 
Hasty  and  reckless.     Peleus  then  in  his  palace  received  me, 


496 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


Carefully  cherished,   and  placed   me  with   thee  as   thy  friend   and 
attendant :  (90) 

Then  let  one  urn  our  bones  receive — that  vase  which  thy  mother 
Gave  thee,  golden  and  f ah'— fit  shrine  for  the  ashes  of  heroes." 

Godlike  Achilles,  swift  in  the  race,  this  answer  returned  him  : 
"And  art  thou  here,  Patroclus  !  beloved  of  my  soul,  to  enjoin  me 
All  these  things  to  perform  ?    Oh  I  think  the?n  already  accomplished ! 
All  shall  be  done,  in  duty  and  love,  whate'er  thou  commandest. 
Now  for  a  moment  approach ;  one  instant  let  me  embrace  thee  : 
Once,  ere  for  ever  we  part,  indulge  we  our  mutual  sorrow." 

Thus   he   spake,   and  his  longing  arms  outstretched  to  embrace 
him : 
Vainly;  for  down  in  the  earth  he  sank,  like  a  vapour  dissolving,  (100) 
Utt'ring  a  feeble  and  ghostly  cry.     Up  starting,  Achilles 
Smote  together  his  hands  in  amaze,  thus  sadly  exclaiming  : 
"Gods  !  can  it  be  ?    Disembodied  souls  from  the  mansions  of  Hades 
Rise!  unsubstantial  forms  of  the  dead — unreal,  yet  life-like ? 
All  through  the  night  hath  the  ghostly  form  of  wretched  Patroclus 
Stood  o'er  my  head  as  I  lay,  with  groans  and  piteous  moanings 
Telling  me  all  I  must  do  :  and  Oh  !  how  like  the  departed  ! " 
Thus  as  he  spake,  the  tears  burst  fresh  from  the  warriors  around  him, 
Nor  did  their  sorrows  cease,  till  rosy-fingered  Aurora 
Rose  on  the  mournful  scene  and  illumined  the  bier.     But  Atreides 
Summoned  from  all  the  tents  both  men  and  mules,  and  dispatched 
them  (IIJ) 

Wood  to  procure  :  and  o'er  them  he  placed  a  chief  of  distinction, 
Merion,  valiant  Idomeneus'  friend  and  faithful  attendant. 
Forth  they  fared  to  the  forest  with  axe  in  hand,  and  provided 
Amply  with  twisted  cords,  and  the  mules  were  driven  before  them. 
Up  hill  and  down,  through  crooked  and  straight,  over  highways  and 

byways, 
On  they  went,  till  the  woods  they  reached  and  fountains  of  Ida. 
Shuddered  the  tow'ring  oaks  to  the  fast-falling  strokes  of  their  axes, 
All  through  their  leafy  crowns,  and  down  they  toppled  in  thtmder, 
Crashing   amain.     These   splitting,    the   sturdy  hands   of   the   Gre- 
cians, (I2°) 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  497 

Bound   with  cords  on  the  mules,   and  back  they  plunged  through 

the  thickets, 
Eager  to  reach  the  plain,  through  paths  deep  worn  by  their  footsteps. 
Every  woodman  carried  a  log,  for  so  had  commanded 
Merion,  valiant  Idomeneus'  friend  and  faithful  companion. 
These,  when  they  reached  the  shore,  they  in  order  laid,  where  Achilles 
Both  for  himself  and  Patroclus  a  mighty  tomb  was  designing. 
Now,  when  a  vast  unmeasured  pile  of  wood  was  collected, 
Down  sate  the  bearers  all,  in  a  body,  awaiting  their  orders. 
He,  meanwhile,  had  commanded  his  valiant  Myrmidon  warriors 
All  in  their  brazen  arms  to  appear,  and  each  with  the  horses    (130) 
Yoked  to  his  car.    They  mustered,  and  shone  refulgent  in  armour. 
Each  brave  chieftain  sprang  to  his  car,  and,  the  reins  their  attendants 
Guiding,  advanced  in  front,  while  a  cloud  of  foot-men  behind  them, 
Many  a  thousand,  marched.     In  their  midst  the  corse  of  Patroclus, 
Borne  by  his  friends,  came,   strewed  with  their  hair  thick  scattered 

upon  it, 
Shorn  from  their  heads.    Achilles  behind,  the  head  of  his  comrade 
Mourning   sustained,   for   the   friend   of  his   youth  was  he   sending 

to  Hades. 
When  at  the  spot  arrived,  by  Achilles  marked  for  the  fun'ral, 
Halting,  they  set  down  the  bier,  and  piled  up  wood  in  abundance. 
Here  Achilles  remembered  the  vow  he  had  made,  and,  retreating  (140) 
Back  some  space  from  the  pyre,  those  yellow  locks  from  his  temples 
Shore,  to  Sperche'ius'  honoured  stream  which  erst  he  devoted; 
Thus,  as  he  mournfully  gazed  o'er  the  dark-blue  waters,  exclaiming  : 
11  Holy  Spercheius  !   vain  was  the  vow  by  Peleus  my  father 
Sworn,  that  if  ever  his  native  land  his  son  should  revisit, 
These,  my  locks,  should  be  thine,  and  a  hecatomb  blaze  in  thine 

honour — 
There,  at  thy  source,  in  the  grove,  whose  fragrance  breathes  round 

thine  altars, 
Fifty  unspotted  rams  at  thy  sacred  shrine  I  should  offer. 
Such   was    the    old   king's   vow.      But   his   prayer   wilt   thou   never 

accomplish. 
Now,  since  I  ne'er  must  revisit  the  dear-lov'd  land  of  my  fathers,  (150)

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


Suffer  these  locks  to  grace  the  bier  of  the  hero  Patroclus." 
Thus  as  he  spake,  on  the  hands  of  his  dear  companion  he  laid  them  : 
All  who  beheld  once  more  dissolved  in  tears,  and  in  mourning. 
Thus  had  the  day  worn  on,  and  the  sun  sunk  down  on  their  sorrows, 
Had  not  Achilles  advanced,  and  thus  addressed  Agamemnon  : 
"Glorious  Atreides  !  whom  above  all  their  leaders  the  Grecians 
Hear  and  obey,  enough  is  giv'n  to  weeping  and  wailing; 
Now  from  the  pile  let  the  Greeks  depart,  and,  dispersing,  provide  them 
Needful  food;  but  let  those  remain  whose  duteous  attendance 
Still    we   require   to   complete    this    work,    with   our    princes    and 

leaders."  (i6o) 

This  when  he  heard,  forthwith  the  king  of  men,  Agamemnon, 
Ordered  his  troops  at  once  to  disperse,  and  return  to  their  vessels  : 
Only  the  mourners  remained,  and  piled  up  the  wood  for  the  burning. 
Each  way  a  hundred' feet  the  structure  grew,  and  upon  it 
High  on  the  summit  the  dead  they  placed.    There,  mourning,  they 

left  him. 
Sheep     well    fattened,     and    beeves    huge-horn'd,    thick-hoofd,    in 

abundance, 
Slew  they  around  the  pyre,  and  flayed  and  dressed  :  and  Achilles 
Spread  o'er  the  corse  their  fat,  and  thickly  cov'ring  o'erlaid  it 
Even  from  head  to  foot;  then  heaped  their  carcases  round  it. 
Bending  next  o'er  the  bier,  great  jars  of  oil  and  of  honey       (170) 
Round  it  he  placed ;  then  four  brave  steeds,  which,  bitterly  sighing, 
Trailing  in  dust  their  beauteous  manes,  he  piled  on  the  structure. 
Two  out  of  nine  familiar  dogs,  at  the  board  of  Patroclus 
Daily  that  fed,  he  dispatched,  to  swell  the  tale  of  the  victims. 
Lastly  (a  fierce  and  savage  deed)  twelve  sons  of  the  Trojans, 
Captives,  of  noble  birth,  by  his  murderous  steel  lay  slaughtered. 
Fire  he  then  to  the  pile  applied  that  the  flames  might  consume  it. 
Thus  invoking,  with  many  a  sigh,  the  shade  of  Patroclus  : 
"  Shade  of  Patroclus  !  hail!  In  the  darksome  dwelling  of  Hades 
This  be  thy  solace  to  know,  that  all  is  done  which  I  promised.    (180) 
Here  on  thy  pyre  lie  slain  twelve  noble  youths  of  the  Trojans, 
Whom  with  thy  corse  the  flames  shall  consume.    Such  honour  shall 

Heaor 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  499 

Never  obtain.    Not  fire,  but  the  dogs  shall  feast  on  his  carcase." 
Such   was  his  threat.     But  the  dogs  respecled  the  slain,    nor   ap- 
proached him  : 
Bright  Aphrodite,  daughter  of  Zeus,  was  nigh  to  protect  him, 
Ever  by  night  and  by  day,  and  drove  them  off,  and  with  ointments 
Roseate,  ambrosial,  kept  him  whole,  though  dragged  by  the  chariot. 
Phoebus  Apollo  too  sent  down  a  cloud  from  the  heavens, 
Thick  overshadowing  the  spot  where  the  hero  lay,  and  the  sunbeams 
All  intercepting,  whose  burning  glow  might  scorch  up  his  moisture,  (190) 
Shrinking  up  all  the  flesh  and  shriveling  the  nerves  and  the  sinews, 

Smouldering  yet  and  unkindled  remained  the  pyre  of  Patroclus. 
This  when  Achilles  perceived,  on  the  winds  he  called  for  assistance. 
Standing  aloof,  to  the  two  great  blasts,  to  Boreas  and  Zephyr, 
Prayed  he,  and  proffering  gifts  of  price  to  be  laid  on  their  altars, 
Large  libations  he  poured  from  a  golden  bowl,  and  besought  them 
Quickly  to  come  and  fan  the  flame,  and  in  bright  conflagration 
Burn  up  the  wood  and  the  dead.     To  his  prayer  heart  11' s  messenger, 

Iris, 
Lent  a  propitious  ear,  and  the  echoing  hall  of  the  tempests 
Sought,    where   the     winds    she    found,    in    the    breezy   palace    of 
Zephyr,  (200) 

Seated  around  his  festive  board.     Her  flight  she  arrested, 
And  on  the  marble  threshold  stood.     All  rose  when  they  saw  her, 
Eachy^r  so  honoured  a  guest  made  room,  and  prayed  her  to  enter. 
This  she  declined,  refusing  a  seat — and  delivered  her  errand  : 
"  Here  may  I  not  repose.     On  the  utmost  verge  of  the  Ocean, 
Far  Ethiopia's  land  I  seek,  where  the  Gods  are  assembling 
Sacred  rites  to  receive,  and  I  go  to  join  in  the  banquet; 
Mighty  Achilles  the  while  to  Boreas  and  Zephyr  is  praying, 
Pledging  himself  to  observance  due,  and  claims  their  assistance, 
That    on    Patroclus'    pyre,    which   the    mourning    Greeks    are    sur- 
rounding, (2I°) 
All   their  blasts  may  be  poured,  and  its   flames  to  the  skies  may 
be  wafted." 
Thus  having  spoken  away  she  flew.     Then  forth  at  her  bidding 
Rushed  both  winds  with  a  scream,  the  clouds  wild  drifting  before  them.

Down  on  the  sea  with  a  sweep  they  came.     High  mounted  the  billows 
Under  their  blast,  and  it  howled  through  the  fertile  region  of  Troia  : 
Then  on  the  pile  it  burst.     Loud  roared  the  flames  in  their  fury. 
All  through  the  live-long  night  on  the  pyre  their    force   they  con- 
centered, 
Raging  and  tossing  the  flames  on  high.     All  night  did  Achilles 
Sprinkle  the  ground  with  wine  from  a  two-handled  goblet,  replenished 
Oft  from  a  golden  urn,  and  ceaseless  called  on  Patroclus,       (220) 
Ever  with  tears  and  groans  invoking  the  shade  of  his  comrade. 
And  as  a  father  who  burns  the  remains  of  his  offspring,  a  bridegroom, 
Newly  wed,  whose  loss  hath  crushed  down  his  parents  with  sorrow. 
So  did  Achilles  mourn  as  he  burned  the  bones  of  Patroclus, 
Grov'ling  on  earth  at  the  foot  of  the  pyre,  and  bitterly  moaning. 
But  when  the  morning-star  arose,  the  herald  of  daybreak, 
Followed  by  dawn,  diffusing  its  saffron  light  o'er  the  ocean, 
Languidly  burned  the  pyre,  and  its  bright  flame  sank  to  a  flicker. 
Homeward,  their  task  performed,  the  winds  retired;  in  their  passage 
Chafing  the  Thracian  seas  into  roaring  billows  beneath  them.         (230) 

Wearied  and  worn  at  length  from  the  pile  withdrawing,  Peleides 
Flung  himself  down,  and  partook  the  sweet  refreshment  of  slumber, 
Soon  interrupted:  for  now  the  Greeks  round  Atreides  assembling, 
All  in  a  body  approached,  and  their  noise  and  tumult  awoke  him. 
Up  to  his  feet  he  started  at  once,  and  thus  he  addressed  them  : 
"  Glorious  Atreides  !  and  you,  ye  foremost  chiefs  of  the  Grecians  ! 
First  be  our  care  with  purple  wine  to  extinguish  the  embers 
All,  wheresoe'er  the  fire  hath  raged :   then,  searching  among  them, 
Gather  the  whitened  bones  of  Patroclus,  son  of  Mencetius, 
Picking   them    carefully   out.     'Twill    be    no    hard    task    to    select 
them ;  (240) 

All  in  the  midst  of  the  pyre  they  lie,  apart  from  the  others, 
Mingled  promiscuous,  of  horses  and  men  piled  up  on  its  borders. 
These  in  a  golden  vase  and  in  cauls  enwrapped  will  we  treasure, 
Waiting  the  day  of  mine  own  descent  to  the  mansion  of  Hades. 
No  vast  tomb  will  we  now  construe!;.     Enough  for  the  present, 
Such  as  a  while  may  suffice.     The  time  will  come  when  Achaia, 
After  my  fall,  at  the  ships  shall  raise  some  worthier  structure, 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  501 

Over  the  ashes  of  both,  to  record  the  fame  of  her  heroes. 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  Greeks  attentive  heard  and  obeyed  him. 
First    they   extinguished    with    wine    the    flames    that  flickering  hov- 
ered .  (25°) 
Yet  o'er  the  pyre  by  fits.     Deep  sank  the  smouldering  embers. 
AYeeping  they  gathered  the  whitened  bones  of  their  gentle  companion 
Into  a  golden  vase,  and  in  twofold  cauls  they  enwrapped  them. 
This  to  the  tents  they  bore,  in  a  snow-white  mantling  of  linen, 
Piously  veiled  :  then  marked  out  the  tomb,  and  deep  its  foundations 
Scooped  round  the  pyre,  and  heaped  up  the  earth  to  a  mound  in  the 

centre  : 
Then,  when  the  work  was  complete,  departed.     Forthwith  Achilles 
Ranged  the  warriors  in  one  vast  ring,  and  made  them  be  seated. 
Then  to  the  ships  for  prizes  sent — for  vases  and  tripods, 
Gen' rous  steeds,  and  mules,  and  strong  laborious  oxen,  (260) 

Delicate-waisted  slaves,  and  huge  grey  masses  of  iron. 
First  for  a  chariot-race  five  prizes  rich  he  allotted ; 
Perfect  in  every  female  art  a  beauteous  damsel, 
And  of  full  two-and-twenty  measures  a  tripod  with  handles ; 
These  to  reward  the  first,     A  mare  for  the  second  in  order, 
Six  years  old,  unbroken,  in  foal  with  a  mule,  was  provided ; 
Then,  for  the  third  in  the  race  a  vase,  four  measures  containing, 
Beauteous,  as  yet  untouched  by  fire,  bright  polish'd  and  glancing ; 
Next,  for  the  fourth  reserved  two  talents  of  gold  were  appointed  ; 
And,  for  the  fifth,  unsoiled  by  smoke,  a  two-handled  goblet.    (270) 
Forth  stood  Achilles  erect,  and  thus  addressed  the  assembly: 
"Glorious  Atreides  !  and  you,  ye  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia  ! 
Here  in  the  ring  for  our  first-rate  charioteers  are  the  prizes. 
Could  I  myself  in  the  race  contend,  on  some  other  occasion 
Victor  assured,  the  first  reward  to  my  tents  I  should  cany. 
All  of  you  know,  my  steeds  transcend  all  others  in  fleetness, 
Come  of  immortal  strain ;   by  Poseidon  giv'n  to  my  father 
Peleus,  which  as  a  parting  gift  to  myself  he  presented  ; 
Yet  I  restrain  those  fiery  steeds,  nor  myself  will  adventure. 
Him  have   they   lost  whose   gentle    strength    was    accustomed    to 
guide  them,  (280)

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


Him,  by  whose  hand  full  oft   their   manes  with  oil  were  anointed, 
Shining  and  smooth,  from  the  limpid  stream  just  fresh.     And  they 

mourn  him, 
Hanging  their  heads  and  trailing  their  manes  on  the  ground  in  their 

sorrow. 
Therefore,  ye  chiefs,  advance,  and  let  each  lead  forth  for  the  contest 
Horses  aiid  car,  whoe'er  can  confide,  of  the  sons  of  Achaia, 
Both  in  his  steeds  and  the  firm-compa&lt;5ted  build  of  his  chariot." 

Thus  Peleides,  and  many  a  chieftain  rose  at  his  challenge. 
Foremost  by  far  of  them  all  upsprang  the  royal  Eumelus, 
Son  of  Admetus,  famed  through  Greece  for  his  chariots  and  horses. 
Great  Diomedes,  Tydeus'  son,  was  next  to  come  forward,        (29°) 
Yoked    to   whose    car   were    those    Troian    steeds    he    had    seized 

from  JEneas, 
When  from  his  rage  Apollo  alone  could  have  rescued  their  master. 
Atreus'  fair-haired  son,  Menelaiis,  heaven-descended, 
Next  for  the  race  prepared,  and  fleet  and  renowned  were  his  coursers, 
^Ethe,  great  Agamemnon's  mare,  and  the  stallion  Podargus. 
Her,  Echepolus,  Anchises'  son,  to  King  Agamemnon 
Sent  as  a  gift,  when,  unwilling  to  march  to  the  conquest  of  Ilion, 
In  his  wide  Sicyan  realm  he  lingered,   in  idle  enjoyment, 
Pamfiring  himself  with  the  wealth  which  Zeus  had  showered  upon  him. 
Ever  prepared  for  the  race  this  mare  had  he  yoked  to  his  chariot.  (300) 
Next,  to  his  car  two  long-maned  steeds  Antilochus  harnessed, 
(Noble  son  of  a  royal  sire,  old  Nelean  Nestor !) 
Swift  were  the  coursers  of  Pylian  breed  that,  yoked  to  his  chariot, 
Whirled  it  along.     His  father  approached,  and,  standing  beside  him, 
Prudent  advice  suggested  to  one  not  wanting  in  shrewdness  : 
"Young  as  thou  art,  my  son,  of  a  truth  both  Zeus  and  Poseidon 
Love  thee  well,  and  have  giv'n  thee  skill  in  the  guidance  of  chariots, 
And  in  the  race  :  nor  in  aught  dost  thou  stand  in  need  of  instruction. 
Deftly  thou  know'st  thy  car  round  the  goal  to  wheel ;  but  thy  horses 
Somewhat  in  fleetness  lack,  and  make  me  fear  for  the  issue.         (310) 
Fleeter  than  thine,  no  doubt,  are  thy  rivals'  steeds ;  but  their  drivers 
Far  less  expert  than  thyself — inferior  in  skill  and  in  judgement  j 
Therefore  be  cool,  my  son,    and  neglecl  no  point  of  advantage. 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  503 

Summon  up  all  thy  skill,  lest  the  nobler  prizes  escape  thee ; 
Tis  but  by  skill,  not  strength,  that  the  carver  surpasses  the  woodman ; 
Knowledge  and  skill  the  pilot  guide  o'er  the  dark-rolling  ocean, 
Keeping  his  ship  in  her  course  through  the  winds  and  waves  that  assail 

her. 
Races  from  rivals  are  won  no  less  by  skill  than  by  swiftness. 
He  who  relies  alone  on  his  coursers'  speed,  and  his  chariot 
Wild   o'er  the   plain   careering,    much    ground    will    lose,   and    be 

hurried  (320) 

Hither  and  thither,  nor  keep  to  the  track,  nor  rein  in  his  horses. 
Who  knows  better  husbands  their  strength,  though  his  steeds  may  be 

slower. 
Ever  the  goal  he  keeps  in  view,  and,  closely  approaching, 
Seizes  the  moment  to  tighten  the  leathern  reins  and  to  turn  it, 
Holding  a  steady  course,  with  an  eye  to  the  chariot  before  him. 
Now  will  I  shew  thee  the  goal.     Thou  canst  not  miss,  nor  mistake  it. 
Seest  thou  yon  old  dry  stump  of  a  fathom's  length  which,  uninjured 
Stands  by  weather  or  time,  for  of  oak  it  is  made  or  of  larch-wood  : 
Two  white  stones  upon  either  hand  stand  leaning  against  it, 
Where  the  way  narrows,  and  round  it  the  course  runs  smoothly  and 

level,  (330) 

Placed  there  of  old,  a  memorial  mark  of  some  warrior  departed, 
Or  as  a  goal  perchance  on  some  former  occasion   erected, 
Now  once  more  to  the  selfsame  use  by  Achilles  appointed  ? 
Hugging  it  close,  round  this  direct  thy  car  and  thy  coursers, 
Leaning  thy  weight  some  whit  to  the  left  on  the  seat  of  the  chariot, 
That  way  to  sway  its  course  :  meanwhile  the  steed  on  thy  right  hand 
Urge  with  thy  goad  and  thy  voice,  and  cease  with  the  rein  to  confine 

him, 
Keeping  the  left-hand  horse  well  home  to  the  goal,  and  approaching 
Just  so  close  that  the  nave  of  thy  chariot-wheel  may  avoid  it, 
Turning   it   sharp.     But  beware   lest   it   touch   the  stone,  and  thy 

chariot  (34°) 

Leaving  o'erturned  and  broken,  thy  steeds  disabled  and  wounded, 
Ho7ne  thou  shouldst  slink,  a  reproach  to  thyself,  a  joy  to  thy  rivals. 
Therefore,  my  son,  once  more,  keep  well  on  thy  guard,  and  be  cautious, 


5°4 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


But  if  thou  once  succeed  in  turning  the  goal  at  advantage, 
Then  push  on  •  for  no  one  will  pass  thee  then  or  o'ertake  thee, 
Not  though  a  courser  he  drive  more  fleet  than  the  noble  Arion, 
Royal  Adrastus'  steed,  of  immortal  race,  or  the  horses 
Bred  by  Laomedon's  self  in  the  fertile  pastures  of  Troia." 

Thus  upon  every  point  his  son  being  sagely  admonished, 
Back  to  his  seat  returned  the  aged  offspring  of  Neleus.  (35°) 

Merion,  the  fifth,  meanwhile  had  harnessed  his  steeds  and  was  ready. 
Up  on  their  cars  they  sprang,  and  cast  in  the  lots  for  their  places. 
These  in  a  casque  Achilles  shook.     To  Antilochus  foremost 
Leaped  forth  his  lot ;  then  appeared  the  token  of  royal  Eumelus  j 
After  him  Atreus'  son,  the  spear-renowned  Menelaiis. 
Merion's  lot  came  next,  and  last  to  the  noble  Tydeides, 
Bravest  of  all,  was  his  place  assigned  in  the  line  of  the  chariots. 
Ranged  for  the  start  they  stood.     To  the  goal  then  pointed  Achilles, 
Far  on  the  level  plain  •  and  Phoenix,  his  father's  attendant, 
Godlike  man,  to  observe  the  race,  and  report  with  exactness       (360) 
All  that  occurred,  he  sent ;  on  his  age  and  experience  relying. 

All  now  at  once  o'er  their  steeds  their  scourges  raised,  and  their 

shoulders 
Beat  with  the  reins,  and  urged  them  on  with  cries  and  with  cheering 
Ceaseless.     Away  from   the   ships  o'er  the  plain  they  swept  like  a 

whirlwind. 
High  in.  the  air  from  beneath  the  chests  of  the  labouring  coursers 
Up    rose    the    trampled    dust   like    some   dense   cloud.      O'er  their 

shoulders 
Streamed  out  behind  as  they  flew  their  floating  manes  on  the  breezes. 
Rattling  now  o'er  the  clod-strown  earth  were  hurried  the  chariots : 
Now  through  the  air  they  bounded  aloft.     Erect  stood  the  drivers 
High    o'er    the    cars,    and   with   beating   hearts   thick   panting    for 

via'ry,  (370) 

Each   with   encouraging    shouts    cheered   on   his   steeds :    and    the 

coursers 
Eagerly  scour'd  o'er  the  field,  and  whirled  up  the  dust  from  beneath 

them. 
Now  had  they  turned  the  goal  at  the  farthest  point,  and  were  tracing 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  505 

Back  to  the  sea  their  course.     Then  came  the  stress  and  the  trial ; 
Straining  each  nerve  they  put  forth  all  their  strength :  and  before  them 
Shot  forth  a-head  the  swift-footed  mares  of  the  grandson  of  Pheres, 
Followed  up  close  by  the  Troian  stallions  of  brave  Diomedes, 
Hardly  a  space  between.     So  near  they  came,  you  had  thought  them 
Ever  in  act  of  mounting  behind  on  the  car  of  Eumelus  ; 
Warm  came  panting  their  breath  on  his  back  and  the  breadth  of  his 

shoulders,  (3  So) 

While  as  they  flew  their  uptossed  heads  seemed  hanging  above  him. 
Then  had  he  passed  him  by,  or  at  least  the  prize  had  divided : 
Phoebus  Apollo,  however,  incensed  at  heart  with  Tydeides, 
Struck    from   his   powerless  hand   the   broidered    scourge   which   he 

fioiwished. 
Tears  of  wrath  and  bitter  despite  then  burst  from  his  eyelids, 
Seeing  his  rival's  car  swift  borne  along,  and  his  own  steeds 
Flagging  for  want  of  the  means  with  goad  and  whip  to  excite  them. 
Soon  to  his  aid,  however,  Athene  came,  who  had  noticed 
This  ill  turn  on  her  hero  by  Phoebus  performed.     She  o'ertook  him, 
And  to  his  hand  the  scourge  restored,  and  strengthened  his  horses.  (390) 
Then  to  the  car  of  Admetus'  son  she  flew,  and  in  anger 
Shattered  its  yoke,  with  immortal  force.     Off  started  the  coursers, 
Dashing  apart,  and  between  them  the  pole  struck  ground  and  was  broken. 
Prostrate  in  front  of  the  wheel  was  Eumelus  hurled  from  his  chariot. 
Battered  he  lay  and  torn;  his  arms,  his  mouth,  and  his  nostrils; 
Bruised  was  his  forehead  across  the  brows.    Fast  gathering  tear-drops 
Darkened  his  sight,  and  his  liquid  voice  was  choked  in  its  utt'rance. 
Past  him  Tydeides  flew,  borne  on  by  the  speed  of  his  horses, 
Leaving  all  others  far  behind,  for  Pallas  Athene 
Filled  them  with  spirit  and  strength,  and  crowned  their  driver  with 

glory.  (400) 

Areus'  son  came  next,  the  fair-hair d  chief  Menelaiis. 
Thus  then  Antilochus  shouted,  upbraiding  the  steeds  of  his  father  : 
"Now  for  a  desperate  push,  with  all  the  speed  ye  can  summon; 
Not  against  brave  Tydeides'  steeds  do  I  claim  your  exertions, 
They  by  Athene's  grace  are  with  strength  endued  and  with  swiftness. 
Victory  sure  is  theirs,  and  glory  will  light  on  their  master.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


Tis  with  Atreides'  steeds  ye  have  now  to  contend  and  o'ertake  them. 
Quick  then !     Suffer  not  y£the',  a  mare,  to  shame  and  disgrace  you. 
Why  should  you  let  yourselves  be  outrun?     Ye  noblest  of  coursers! 
Hear    what   I   say,    and   what,   be   assured,   will   be    fully    accom- 
plished: (4IQ) 
Nurture   and   care  henceforth  from  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his 

people, 
Nestor,  cease  to  expect :  with  the  edge  of  the  sword  will  he  slay  you. 
If  but  some  paltry  prize  we  win,  neglectful  and  careless. 
Quick  then!  I  say,  and  follow  them  up.     Make  haste   to  o'ertake 

them. 
I  myself  will  exert  my  skill,  and  watch  my  occasion. 
There  in  yon  narrow  way  will  I  pass,  nor  let  them  escape  me." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  his  steeds    aroused  by  the  threats   of  their 
master, 
Mended  their  pace  for  a  time,  till  the  narrow  pass  that  he  spake  of 
Down  in  the  hollow  way,  came  full  in  view  of  the  warrior : 
Where,    in   a   cleft   of  the  plain,  scooped   out  by  the  rains  of  the 
winter,  (420) 

Broken  away  was  the  road,  and  the  ground  deep  furrowed  with  gullies. 
Cautiously  there  Menelaiis  drove,  to  avoid  a  collision. 
Not  so  Antilochus.     Turning  his  steeds  aside,  and  inclining 
Out  of  the  regular  track,   some  space  abreast  of  the  others 
Drove  he  amain.     Menelaiis  shrank,  and  called  to  his  rival  : 
"  Rashly, — madly  thou  driv'st,  Antilochus!   Rein  in  thy  horses! 
Here  is  the  road  too  narrow  to  pass.     Anon  'twill  be  broader. 
Have  then  a  care  lest  thou  crush  us  both,  running  foul  of  my  chariot." 
Nought  did  Antilochus  heed,  but  all  the  faster  his  horses 
Urged    on    with    whip    and  goad,    nor   seemed   to   hear    the    re- 
monstrance. (43°) 
Far  as  a  quoit  can  fly,  by  the  stalwart  arm  of  the  athlete 
Hurled  as  a  trial  of  strength,  when  youths  for  the  prize  are  contending, 
So  far  abreast  they  ran.     Then  relaxed  his  speed  Menelaiis, 
And  of  his  own  accord  gave  way,  nor  urged  on  his  horses, 
Dreading,  in  that  wild  rush,  that  their  steeds,  becoming  entangled, 
Both  fair  cars  should  o'erturn ;  and,  stretched  in  the  dust  by  each  other, 


Book  XXI 1 1.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  507 

Foul  defeat  and  disgrace  should  end  their  struggle  for  vict'ry. 
Chidingly  thus  then   spake  that  fair-hair'd  chief  Menelaiis  : 
"No  man  beside  thyself  on  so  mad  an  attempt  would  have  ventured. 
Falsely,  Antilochus,  call  thee  wise  the  Greeks  thy  companions  !  (440) 
Off  with  thee  !  think  not  however,  unsworn,  to  claim  thine  advantage." 
This  to  Antilochus  :  then  to  his  steeds  he  turned  and  addressed  them : 
"Loiter  not !  let  not  your  hearts  be  grieved.    Push  forward  with  spirit, 
Sooner  the  feet  will  falter  and  fail  of  those  that  surpassed  you, 
Than  shall  your  own.     They  are  both  distressed,  and  their  freshness 

is  over." 
Thus  he  spake,  and,  dreading  the  chiding  voice  of  their  master, 
Quick'ning  their  pace  they  flew,  and  soon  the  lost  ground  had  re- 
covered. 
All  in  a  cirque  the  Greeks  were  ranged  and  witnessed  the  racing. 
Pleased  they  had  seen  them  scouring  the  dusty  plain,  and  were  watching 
Now  their  return.     Idomeneus  first  perceived  them  advancing,    (450) 
High  on  a  lofty  point  where  he  sate,  on  the  skirts  of  the  circus. 
Him  in  the  front  he  knew,  though  far,  by  the  voice  of  his  cheering, 
And  by  a  steed  that  caught  his  eye,   distinguished  for  beauty, 
Chestnut  his  coat  in  ev'ry  part,  save  that  bright  on  his  forehead 
Shone  forth  a  silvery  spot,  like  a  star,  or  the  moon  in  her  glory. 
Up  rose  the  Cretan  king,  and  spake  this  word  to  the  Argives : 
"  Friends  and  rulers  of  Greece  !  her  leaders  in  war  and  in  council, 
Am  I  the  first  to  know  those  steeds  ?  or  do  ye  too  observe  it  ? 
Other  they  seem  than  those  which  took  the  lead  when  they  started; 
Different  too  is  their  charioteer.     Those  mares  of  Eumelus      (460) 
Ever  were  best  and  first.     Sure,  some  mishap  hath  befall'n  them! 
Safe,  and  leading  the  race,  when  turning  the  goal  I  beheld  them, 
Now  when  I  send  my  gaze  o'er  the  Troian  plain,  and  on  all  sides 
Narrowly  search,  those  steeds,  that  car,  can  I  nowhere  discover. 
Either  its  driver  hath  dropped  the  reins,  or   in  turning  the  corner 
Failed  to  avoid  the  goal,  or  suffered  his  horses  to  wander. 
Tossed  from  his  car  perchance  he  lies,  and  the  chariot  is  shattered, 
While  those  infuriate  mares  have  burst  their  harness  and  bolted. 
Stand   up.      Look  for    yourselves:    for   my   eyes    perchance    have 
deceived  me, 


508  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXIII. 

Not  discerning  so  well.     But  the  foremost  looks  like  a  chieftain,  (470) 
Known  to  us  all  of  ^Etolian  race,  a  ruler  among  us, 
Horse-taming  Tydeus'  mighty  son,  the  brave  Diomedes." 
Thus  then  sharply  rebuked  him  the  swift  Oilean  Aias : 
"Why  wilt  thou  prate  thus  simply,  Idomeneus?   There  thou  may'st 

see  them, 
Those  same  prancing  mares,  o'er  the  field  advancing  towards  us. 
Not  so  much  the  youngest  art  thou  of  the  sons  of  Achaia, 
Nor  are  those  eyes  looking  out  from  thy  head  the  sharpest  of  organs. 
Ever  at  random  thou  talk'st.     But  now  thy  prattle  we  heed  not. 
Clearer  of  sight  and  abler  to  judge  there  are  others  beside  thee. 
There  are  Eumelus'  steeds  in  front  of  all,  as  at  starting :        (480) 
There  is  Eumelus  holding  the  reins  and  guiding  the  chariot." 
Angrily  then  the  Cretan  prince  this  answer  returned  him  : 
"Aias !   re  viler !   good  at  abuse  alone,  but  in  all  things 
Else  inferior  to  all,  for  insulting  and  rude  is    thy  nature  : 
Come  now  !  stakes  let  us  pledge — a  tripod  fair,  or  a  goblet. 
Atreus'  son,  Agamemnon  himself,  shall  pronounce  the  decision, 
Which  of  the  cars  is  first,  and  make  thee  pay  for  thy  rudeness." 
Thus  he  spake;  and,  to  wrath  aroused,  Oilean  Aias 
Would  have  replied  to  the  king  in  words  injurious  and  bitter, 
And  in  a  long  and  fierce  dispute  the  matter  had  ended,  (49°) 

Had  not  Achilles  aris'n  and  thus,  interposing,   addressed  them : 
"Aias  !  Idomeneus  !  cease  from  reproach  and  angry  rejoinder, 
Such  as  become  not   chiefs  like  you.     Yourselves  would  condemn 

them 
If  among  others  ye  heard  such  harsh  reproof  and  invective. 
Take  your  seats  in  the  ring.     Look  out,  and  mark  their  arrival; 
Soon  will  you  see  them  yourselves  come  rushing  in,  for  the  vict'ry 
Striving  amain;  and  yourselves  will  judge  (no  need  of  an  umpire), 
Which  of  the  Grecians'  cars  is  first,  and  which  is  the  second." 
Thus  while  he  spake  Tydeides  approached,  dashing  in  at  the  gallop, 
Fiercely  plying  the  scourge  round  his    shoulders   whirled,  and   the 

horses  (5°°) 

Rose  at  each  bound  in  the  air  as  they  swept  along,  and  in  hand- 
fuls 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER,  509 

Up  flew  the  dust,  begriming  the  face  and  form  of  the  driver. 
Blazing  with  tin  and  with  gold  the  car  came  rolling  behind  them, 
Close  on  their  steps ;   so  lightly  borne  that  hardly  its  wheel-tires 
Left  in  the  dust  their  trace.     Like  a  flight  it  seemed,  as  the  coursers 
Darted  along,  and  regained  the  point  whence  first  they  departed. 

Now  in  the  midst  of  the  ring  was  the  chariot  stayed.     In  a  torrent 
Down  poured  the  sweat  on  the  ground  from  the  necks  and  chests  of 

the  horses. 
Springing  from  off  the  resplendent  car  Tydeides  alighted, 
Leaning  his  scourge  against  the  yoke.     His  gallant  attendant,     (510) 
Sthenelus,  stood  prepared,  and  at  once  laid  claim  to  the  prizes ; 
Forthwith  the  damsel  dispatched  to  the  tents  in  charge  of  his  comrades ; 
Sent  too  the  tripod ;  himself  the  steeds  unyoked  from  the  chariot. 

Now  came  Antilochus,  driving  the  panting  horses  of  Nestor, 
Who  by  his  craft,  and  not  their  speed,  had  passed  Menelaiis. 
Close  behind  Menelaiis  himself  followed  swift  on  his  traces, 
Barely  such  space  between  as  divides  the  wheel  from  the  courser, 
When  at  his  utmost  speed  he  whirls  on  his  lord  in  a  chariot 
Over  the  plain — when  the  hairs  of  his  tail  outstreaming  behind  him 
Graze    on   the   tire    of  the    wheel    as    they   scour   along   o'er    the 
country,  (52°) 

One  in  advance,  the  other  behind,  almost  nothing  between  them  : 
Hardly  more  was  the  space  between  that  parted  the  rivals. 
Far  as  a  quoit  might  fly  was  that  space  at  first.     Menelaiis 
This  had  already  retrieved ;   for  fleeter  and  stronger  than  ever 
Still  pushed  on  to  the  last  that  wortdrous  mare  of  his  brother's ; 
And  would  have  once  more  ta'en  the  lead  and  passed  her  opponents, 
Had  but  a  longer  course  afforded  scope  for  her  mettle. 

Merion  next,  Idomeneus'  friend  and  faithful  attendant, 
Far  as  a  jav'lin's  cast  came  lagging  behind  Menelaiis. 
Tardiest  of  all,  though  beauteous  to  view,  were  his  steeds,  and  their 
driver  (530) 

All  unskilled  in  his  craft,  and  unused  to  contend  in  the  circus. 
Far  in  the  rear  of  all  came  toiling  the  son  of  Admetus, 
Trailing  his  broken  car,  and  driving  his  horses  before  him. 

Pitying  his  dismal  plight,  the  godlike  Achilles  beheld  him, 


510  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXIII. 

And  to  the  front  of  the  Greeks  advancing,  thus  he  addressed  them : 

"Lo  !  in  what  piteous  case  comes  plodding  the  best  of  our  racers  ! 

Shall  we  not  give  him  the  second  prize  ?  'Twere  but  fitting  and  seemly. 

Tydeus'  son  must  take  the  first ;  for  he  fairly  has  won  it." 

Thus  he  spake  :   and  all  applauding  heard  the  proposal. 

Then    had    Eumelus    the    mare    received,     by     acclaim     of    the 

Grecians,  (54°) 

Had  not  Antilochus,  Nestor's  heroic  son,  interposing, 
Thus  to  Achilles  appealed  in  behalf  of  justice  and  honour: 
"Shouldst  thou  persist  in  this,  deep  cause  of  complaint,  O  Achilles ! 
Then  would  be  mine  ;  my  prize  shouldst  thou  take  and  give  to  another. 
What  though  that  other  be  ever  so  skilled,  though  his  chariot   be 

shattered, 
Injured  his  steeds  ? — To  pray  to  the  Gods  no  doubt  he  neglected. 
That  had  he  done,  not  thus  the  last  had  we  seen  him  arriving. 
But  if  thou  pity  his  sad  mishap,  and  love  him  so  dearly, 
Gold  in  plenty  and  brass  in  thy  tents  are  stored.     Thou  hast  cattle, 
Beauteous  captive  maids,  and  prancing  steeds,  to  select  from.       (550) 
Choosing  from  these,  thou  mayst  give  him  a  costlier  prize  and  a  fitter, 
Either  hereafter,  or  now  on  the  spot,  that  the  Greeks  may  applaud 

thee. 
Her  will  I  never  resign.     Be  it  known  to  whoever  may  touch  her, 
First  must  he  fight  with  me,  and  by  arms  obtain  her  possession." 
Thus  he  spake  :   and  noble  Achilles  smiled  and  responded, 
Fav'ring  Antilochus  much,  as  a  comrade  dear  and  respected. 
Graciously  therefoi'e  he  spake  and  this  was  the  answer  he  made  him  : 
"Erin  as  thou,  wilt,  so  be  it,  my  friend  !  From  my  treasures  selected 
Some  rich  gift,  as  thou  say'st,  Eumelus  to  grace  will  I  furnish. 
Let  him  accept  the  corslet  I  stripped  from  Asteropaeus,  (5 60) 

Gorgeous,  of  solid  brass,  with  a  bead  of  tin  round  the  margin, 
Artfully  drawn.     At  a  goodly  price  must  its  value  be  reckoned." 
Thus  he  spake :   Automedon  then,  his  faithful  attendant, 
Sent  to  his  tent,  who  the  corslet  brought,  and  laid  it  before  him. 
This  in  Eumelus'  hands  he  placed,  who  gladly  received  it. 
Now  before  all  Menelaiis  rose,  much  hurt  and  offended, 
And  with  Antilochus  deeply  wrath.     Advancing,  a  herald 


Book  XXIIL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  511 

Placed  in  his  hands  a  sceptre,  and  signed  to  the  Greeks  to  be  silent' 
Then  did  the  godlike  chief  these  words  address  to  his  rival : 
"How  could  a  man,  reputed  wise,  commit  such  an  outrage?  (570) 
Casting  so  foul  a  slur  on  my  skill,  endang'ring  my  horses, 
Pushing  thine  own  unfairly  before  them,  far  their  inferiors  ? 
Now  then,  ye  chiefs  of  Greece  !  her  leaders  in  war  and  in  council ! 
Judge  without  favour  between  us  both ;  for  I  would  not  that  any 
Here  of  our  mail-clad  Greeks  should  hereafter  blame  me  in  this  wise — 
— 'Foully,  by  force  of  lies,  Menelaiis  supplanted   his  rival, 
'  Off  from  Antilochus  bearing  the  prize,  though  his  steeds  were  inferior ; 
1  What   though   in   personal   strength   and  skill,    no  doubt,    he  sur- 
passed him' — 
— Hear  me  propose  a  test,  to  which  none,  methinks,  of  the  Argives, 
Aught  will  object  or  oppose,  for  all  will  acknowledge  its  justice.  (580) 
Stand  thou  forward,  Antilochus  !  favoured  of  Zeus,  and  approaching, 
In  the  accustomed  form  for  an  oath,  in  front  of  thy  horses, 
Holding  the  pliant  lash  in  thine  hands  that  served  thee  to  drive  them, 
Place  thy  hand  on  the  steeds,  and  swear  by  earth-shaking  Poseidon, 
That  thou  hadst   nought  unfair  in  thy  thoughts  when   jostling  my 

horses." 
Prudently  then  in  gentle  words  Antilochus  answered : 
"Let  not  the  error  of  one  so  young  too  deeply  offend  thee — 
Thee,  Menelaiis  !  a  prince,  my  superior  in  age  and  in  station. 
Well  thou  knowest  the  rashness  of  youth,  its  proneness  to  error, 
Hasty  and  thoughtless  ever  in  mind,  unstable  in  counsel ;  (59°) 

Bear  with  me  then  in  thy  heart.     The  mare  will  I  readily  yield  thee, 
As  I  received,  so  take  her,  and  aught  beside,  from  my  treasure 
(If  thou  desirest  aught  more  rich,  more  rare) :  I  will  add  it, 
Rather  than  lose  thy  esteem,  O  prince  !  and  rather  than  forfeit 
Once  and  for  ever  a  place  in  thy  heart,  and  sin  against  Heaven." 

Thus  spake  the  noble  Nestor's  son ;  and  with  courteous  demeanour, 
Leading  the  mare,  in  his  hands  he  placed  the  rein.     Through  his  bo- 
som 
Joy  was  diffused,  as  when  copious  dews  descend  on  the  harvests, 
What  time  the  bristling  ears  stand  parched  and  thirsting  for  moisture  : 
Thus  was  thy  heart  with  joy  refreshed  and  cheered,  Menelaiis!  (600) 


512 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


Then  replying,  in  cheerful  and  kindly  words  he  addressed  him : 
"  Gladly,  Antilochus  !  now  from  my  heart  all  feeling  of  anger 
Will  I  dismiss,  for  ne'er  before  wert  thou  wild  or  imprudent ; 
What  though  for  once  the  rashness  of  youth  have  gained  the  as- 
cendant. 
Only  forbear  henceforth  to  circumvent   thy  superiors, 
Since  not  another  Greek  would  so  soon  have  obtained  my  forgiveness. 
Thou  however  hast  toiled  and  suffered  much  in   my  quarrel, 
Thou  and  thy  noble  father,  who  fights  in  my  cause,  and  thy  brother. 
Take  my  forgiveness,  freely  granted  as  asked,  and  the  steed  too, 
Take,    though    my    own    by .  right ;    so    that    all  may    see   Mene- 
laiis  (610) 

Knows  in  his  turn  to  yield,  nor  indulges  in  pride  or  resentment." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  mare  to  Antilochus'  friend,  to  Ndemon, 
Handed,  to  lead  her  away,  and  the  vase  in  her  stead  he  accepted. 
Merion,  in  order  the  fourth,  two  talents  of  gold  for  his  guerdon, 
Duly  received.      Unclaimed  remained  the  two-handed  goblet, 
Fifth  of  the  prizes  proposed  :  and  this  to  Nestor  Achilles 
Bore,  through  all  the   assembled   Greeks,  and   presenting   address- 
ed him  : 
"  Nestor  !  old  and  revered !   receive  this  token  of  friendship, 
Which  of  our  dear  Patroclus  lost  may  serve  to  remind  thee, 
Whom  thou  shalt  never  among  us  again  behold.     Uncontested  (620) 
Take  this  prize  :  since  now  no  more  in  the  ring  with  the  csestus 
Canst  thou  contend,  nor  in  wrestling  join,  nor  in  hurling  the  jav'lin, 
Nor  in  the  race  : — for  the  burden  of  years  weighs  heavy  upon  thee." 

Ending,  he  placed  in  his  hands  the  prize.     With  joy  he  received  it; 
And  in  reply  these  words  he  promptly  addressed  to  Achilles : 
"  Only  too  true  indeed,  my  son,  are  the  words  thou  hast  spoken. 
Vigour  my  tot f  ring  knees  and  swiftness  my  feet  have  forsaken ; 
Pliant  no  more,  these  arms  hang  listless  down  from  my  shoulders. 
Would  I  were  young  once  more  !  that  again  such  force  I  could  sum- 
mon 
As  at  th'  Epeians'  funeral  games  for  their  king,  Amarynceus,  (630) 
When  at  Buprasium  his  sons  in  their  father's  honour  the  prizes 
Staked.     My  equal  was  none  among  all  the  assembled  Epeians, 


Book  XXI IL]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  513 

All  the  ^Etolians  fierce,  and  the  youthful  Pylian  warriors. 
Brave  Clytomedes,  Enop's  son,  I  quelled  with  the  csestus; 
Wrestling,  Ancaeus  of  Pleuron  I  threw,  who  accepted  my  challenge ; 
Swift  as  he  was,  Iphiclus  I  left  behind  in  the  foot-race; 
Far  beyond  Phyles  I  hurled  the  spear,  and  strong  Polydorus. 
Only  the  sons  of  Actor  surpassed  my  steeds  in  the  circus. 
Eager  to  gain  the  highest  prize  and  envying  my  prowess, 
Two  against  one  (for  twins  they  were)  together  they  mounted,     (640) 
One  direcled  the  car,  fast  holding  the  reins,  while  the  other, 
All  to  his  guidance  and  skill  entrusting,  lashed  on  the  horses. 
Such  was  I  then.     But  now  unto  younger  men  I  abandon 
All  such  exploits,    and,  yielding  to  time's  irresistible  pressure, 
Gladly  retire  from  fields  where  once  I  ranked  among  heroes. 
Now  proceed  with  the  games,  and  complete  the  rites  of  thy  comrade. 
This  with  delight  I  receive.     As  a  heart-felt  proof  I  accept  it, 
That  thy  old  friend  thou  hast  ever  in  mind.,  nor  neglecl'st  an  occasion 
Honour  to  shew  to  one  whom  the  Greeks  think  worthy  of  honour. 
And  may  the  Gods  requite  thy  deed,  and  crown  thee  with  bless- 
ings." (650) 
Thus  he  spake,  and  Peleides  returned  through  the  crowd  of  the 
Grecians, 
Pleased  with  the  thanks  and  grateful  praise  of  the  offspring  of  Neleus, 
Back  to  his  place  :  then  set  forth  the  stakes  for  champions  in  boxing. 
First,  in  the  ring  was  bound  a  mule,  full  grown,  and  unbroken, 
Six  years  old  and  hard  to  tame  and  of  stubborn  endurance, 
While,  to    console    the  vanquished,  a  two-handled   goblet   he  prof- 
fered. 
Standing  erect,  these  words  he  next  addressed  to  the  Argives  : 
"O  ye  Atreidae !    and  all  ye  bright-greaved  sons  of  Achaia ! 
Now  let  champions  twain  stand  forward,  masters  of  boxing, 
Ready  to  fight  in  the  ring;  and  the  man  whom  Phoebus  Apollo  (660) 
Favours,  approved  by  all  the  Greeks,  acknowledged  as  victor, 
Lead  to  his  tent  in  triumph  this  useful  mule ;  and  the  vanquished, 
(Not  to  have  fought  in  vain)  shall  receive  this  beauteous  goblet." 

Scarce  had  he  said,  up  started  a  huge  and  redoubtable  champion, 
Panopeus'  son,  Epeius,  of  dread  renown  as  a  boxer.

Forward  he  strode,  and  laying  his  hand  on  the  mule,  he  addressed  them  : 
"Let  him  stand  forth  whosoe'er  hath  courage  to  fight  for  the  goblet ; 
As  for  the  mule — he  is  mine  I  not  a  Greek  among  you  can  win  him, 
Standing  up  fairly  in  fight :  for  here  at  least  am  I  master ; 
What  though  in  battle  of  less  renown.     ('Tis  not  for  a  mortal      (670) 
All  to  attempt  with  success,  and  shine  forth  perfect  in  all  things.) 
This  I  delare,  and  this  will  do.     Whoe'er  shall  attempt  it 
That  man's  flesh  will  I  pound,  and  break  each  bone  in  his  body. 
So  let  his  friends  be  ready  at  hand  and  lend  their  assistance, 
Battei-ed  and  bruised  to  support  and  bear  him  away  from  the  combat." 
Thus  he  spake.     Dismayed  were  the  Greeks  and  heard  him  in  silence. 
Only  Euryalus,  god-like  chief,  uprose  at  his  challenge, 
Son  of  Mecistheus  was  he,  and  grandson  of  royal  Talaion, 
Who  in  the  games  at  Thebae  held,  at  CEdipus'  fun'ral,  (679) 

Challenged    the   brave    Cadmeian   youth,    and    fought    them,    and 

conquered.  (680) 

Backed  and  prepared  for  the  fight  by  spear-renowned  Diomedes, 
Ardently  hoping  his  friend's  success,  whom  with  words  he  encouraged, 
First  round  his  waist  a  belt  he  clasped ;  then  his  wrists  he  encircled, 
Wrapping  them  round  with  thongs  of  tough  bull-hide,  to  protect  them. 

Now  for  the  fight  when  both  were  girt  they  entered  the  circus, 
Holding  their  stalwart  arms  advanced  :  then  closed  on  each  other, 
And  in  quick- answering  blows  and  wards  their  fists  were  commingled  ; 
Dire  was  the  thud  of  their  strokes  and  the  crashing  of  jaws.     From 

their  members 
Down  poured  the  sweat  in  streams.     Then  in  rushed  mighty  Epeius, 
And  as  his  foeman  looked  askance,  such  a  buffet  he  dealt  him,   (690) 
Full-  on  the  cheek,  as  hurled  him  to  earth,  for  nought  could  resist  it : 
And  as  some  huge  unwieldy  fish  with  the  spray  by  the  north  wind 
In  the  black  surge  tossed  up,  on  the  weedy  shore  lies  flound'ring, 
Thus  flung  forth  lay  the  stricken  chief.     But  Epeius  upraised  him, 
Lifting  him  up  on  his  legs ;  and  his  comrades  gath'ring  around  him, 
Led  him  from  out  the  ring,  his  feet  scarce  dragging  behind  him, 
Vomiting  gore,  with  his  drooping  head  hanging  down  on  his  shoulder  : 
Swooning  and  senseless  at  length  they  laid  him  down,  and  retiring, 
Some  of  them  mournfully  bore  to  his  tent  the  two-handled  goblet. 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  515 

Once    more    Peleides    rose,    and    displayed    to  the  sight    of   the 

Grecians  (7°°) 

Stakes  for  a  third  great  trial  of  strength  and  endurance,  in  wrestling. 
That  for  the  winner  proposed  was  a  tripod,  capacious  and  massive, 
Strong  to  endure  the  fire,  for  whose  price  twelve  oxen  were  reckoned; 
While  for  the  vanquished  a  female  slave  was  placed  in  the  circus, 
Skilled  in  domestic  works.     Four  beeves  were  counted  her  value. 
Standing  erect,  these  words  Peleides  addressed  to  the  Argives  :  [706] 
"Stand  forth  ye  who  mean  to  contend  for  the  prize  of  the  wrestlers." 
Thus  as  he  spake,  upsprang  the  great  Telamonian  Aias; 
Next  Odysseus,  expert  to  seize  each  point  of  advantage.  (7°9) 

Girding  their  loins  they  at  once  stepped  forth  in  the  midst  of  the  circus, 
And  in  a  moment  their  nervous    anns  were  twined   in  each  other, 
Leaning,  their  feet  apart,  like  rafters  they  stood,  which  a  builder 
Rears  for  some  lofty  roof,  to  baffle  the  force  of  the  tempest. 
Wrenched  with  the  strain  their   backs    seemed   ready  to  crack,   in 

contortions 
Throw'n  by  their,  pow'rful  grasp,  and  the  sweat  rolled  down  them 

in  torrents, 
Livid  with  blood,  great  wheals  arose  on  their  sides  and  their  shoulders, 
Each  fresh  struggle  leaving  its  mark.     Yet  still  they  contended, 
Both  determined  to  win  the  prize,  the  beauteous  tripod. 
Nor  could  Odysseus  avail  to  trip  or  o'erturn  his  opponent, 
Neither  could  Aias  prevail,  so  stoutly  resisted  Odysseus.  (72°) 

Long  they  strove  till  the  Greeks  at  length  grew  weary  and  murmured. 
Thus  then  the  great  Telamonian  chief  bespake  his  opponent : 
"  Noble  son  of  Laertes  !  most  wise  and  inventive  Odysseus  ! 
Either  lift  me  or  I  thee.     Let  Zeus  determine  between  us." 
Thus  he  spake  :  then  strained  a7id  heaved  him  up,  but  Odysseus 
Smote  on  his  ham  from  behind,  and  his   knees   gave  way,  and  he 

tumbled 
Flat  on  his  back.     Down  fell  they  both,  but  Odysseus  upon  him 
Lay,  on  his  chest,  while  the  Greeks  admiring  gazed,  and  applauded. 
Next,  in  turn,  Odysseus  essayed  to  lift  his  opponent : 
Just  could  he  move  him  from  off  the  ground,  but  to  raise  him  availed 

not;  (73o)

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


For,  with  the  weight,  his  knees  gave  way,  and  falling  together, 
Side  by  side  they  lay,  with  dust  begrimed  and  disfigured. 
Rising,  prepared  for  a  fresh  assault,  they  had  wrestled  a  third  time, 
Had  not  Achilles  himself,  interposing,  ris'n  and  restrained  them : 
"  Cease  to  contend,  and  by  further  struggles  to  injure  each  other; 
Both  are  victorious,  both  shall  with  equal  prizes  be  honoured. 
Now  make  way,  and  let  others  advance  to  share  in  our  contests." 
Thus  as  he  spake  they,  nought  reluctant,  heard  and  obeyed  him ; 
Wiped  off  the  dust,  their  mantles  resumed,  and  rejoined  the  spectators : 
While  for  the  rapid  race  Peleides  set  forth  the  prizes.  (74°) 

First  was  produced  a  silver  bowl  six  measures  containing, 
Gorgeously  chased,  beyond  compare  surpassing  in  beauty 
All  that  had  ever  been  wrought  on  earth.     Sidonian  artists 
Framed  it  with  wondrous  skill,  and  bold  Phoenician  advent'rers 
Bore  it  across  the  shadowy  seas  and  presented  to  Thoas, 
Offr'ing  it  first  in  vain  for  sale  in  each  port  that  they  touched  at. 
This  by  Eunelus  Iason's  son,  Lycaon  to  ransom 
(Priam's  unhappy  son),  had  been  sent  in  exchange  to  Patroclus, 
Now  at  the  fun'ral  games  of  his  friend,  set  forth  by  Achilles, 
Him  to    reward    who   in    fleetness   of   foot    should    distance    his 
rivals.  [75°] 

For  the  next  prize  an  ox  well  fed  and  f&amp;t  for  the  slaughter;  (750) 
Half  a  talent  of  gold  must  content  the  third,  and  the  loser. 
Standing  erect  these  words  Peleides  addressed  to  the  Argives : 
"Stand  forth,  ye  who  mean  to  contend  for  a  prize  in  the  foot-race" 
Thus. he  spake,  and  at  once  stood  forth  Oilean  Aias, 
Wise  Odysseus,  and  noble  Antilochus,  offspring  of  Nestor,  L75^] 

Ranged  in  an  even  row  for  a  start  they  stood,  and  Achilles  (757) 

Marked  out  the  course  to  be  run,  and  shewed  them  the  goal  at  a  dis- 
tance. 
Oft  they  started.     Oileus  first  sprang  forth,  and  Odysseus 
Followed  him  close :    as  close  to  the  breast  of  some  diligent  ma- 
tron (760) 
Flies  the  swift  shuttle  athwart  the  woof  which  her  hands  disentangle, 
Parting  the  threads  of  the  web,  and  drawing  them  close  to  her  bosom; 
Even  so  close  upon  Aias  Odysseus  pressed,  and  his  footsteps 


Book  XXIII.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  517 

Covered  the  prints  of  his  rival's  feet  ere  their  dust  had  subsided ; 
While  on  his  head  he  could  feel  the  panting  breath  of  Odysseus, 
Following  swift  behind.     Then  shouted  aloud  the  Achaians, 
Cheering  him  on  in  his  eager  career  and  struggle  for  vicYry. 
Now  they  at  length   the   end  of  their   course   approached,  and 
Odysseus 
Thus  in  his  heart  a  prayer  addressed  to  blue-eyed  Athene: 
".Hear  me,  O  Goddess  !  and  aid  my  feet  in  this  arduous  contest."  (770) 
Mentally  thus  he  prayed,  and  his  prayer  reached  Pallas  Athene. 
Swiftness  and  vigour  she  sent.     Each  limb  she  supported  and  strength- 
ened; 
And,  at  the  final  burst,  when  in  view  of  the  prize  they  were  straining, 
Aias  in  running  slipped  and  fell  (o'erthrown  by  Athene) 
Just  on  the  spot  where  Achilles  the  oxen  had  slain  to  Patroclus, 
Where  with  their  gore  and  their  dung  the  ground  was  slipp'ry  and 

treach'rous, 
Full  on  his  face;  and  his  nostrils  and  mouth  were  filled  with  the  ordure. 
Swift  rushing  in,  Odysseus  seized  the  bowl;    and  his  rival, 
Soon  regaining  his  feet,  came  in  for  the  ox,  and  beside  him 
Taking   his    stand,   with   his   hand  he  grasped   his  horn,  and  re- 
cov'ring  (780) 

Breath,  and  sputt'ring  the  dirt  from  his  mouth,  addressed  the  Achaians : 
"Surely  some  envious  pow'r  must  have  tripped  my  feet.     'Twas  the 

Goddess, 
Who,  like  a  mother,  is  ever  at  hand  to  succour  Odysseus.". 
Such  his  complaint :  and  the  Greeks  with  a  burst  of  laughter  received  it. 
Last  came  Antilochus  in,  and  received  the  prize  of  the  loser. 
Smiling  he  took  it,  and  cheerfully  thus  addressed  he  the  Argives : 
"  Now  is  it  clear,  my  friends,  and  you  all  must  perceive,  the  immortals 
Shew  their  regard  for  age  and  espouse  the  cause  of  our  seniors. 
Aias  is  somewhat  of  riper  years  than  myself:   but  Odysseus 
Boasts  of  yet  older  date,  and  belongs  to  a  past  generation.         (790) 
His  is  a  green  old  age.     Of  all  the  host  of  the  Argives 
Only  Achilles  himself  in  fleetness  of  foot  can  excel  him." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  his  praise  fell  sweet  on  the  ear  of  Peleides, 
Who  with  complacent  and  courteous  words  addressed  him  in  answer  :

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


"Think  not,  Antilochus,   praise  from  thee  shall  pass  unrewarded, 
Take  for  thy  share  another  half-talent  of  gold  in  addition." 
Then  in  his  hand  the  gold  he  placed,  and  with  joy  he  received  it. 

Next,  in  the  ring  Peleides  a  long-forth-shadowing  jav'lin 
Placed,  for  another  prize,  with  a  plumy  casque  and  a  falchion, 
Spoil  of  Sarpedon  in  battle  slain  by  the  ?night  of  Patroclus.  (800) 

Standing  erect,  these  words  he  addressed  to  the  chiefs  of  the  Argives  : 
"  Now  let  us  try  a  fiercer  ga?ne.     Let  two  of  our  heroes, 
Donning  their  arms  for  the  fight,  and  wielding  their  death-dealing 

weapons, 
Here  in  the  sight  of  assembled  Greece  confront  one  another. 
Whoso  the  first  shall  stain  with  blood  the  fair  skin  of  the  other,. 
Pierce  through  his  corslet  or   shield,  and  wound   his  flesh  through 

his  armour, 
Him  with  this  Thracian  sword  will  I  grace,  with  scabbard  of  silver, 
Silver-hilted,    the  same  that  I  took  from  Asteropaeus. 
Both  shall  receive  those  gorgeous  arms  in  common  between  them, 
And  in  my  tent  a  noble  feast  shall  be  giv'n  in  their  honour." 
Thus  as  he  spake  uprose  the  great  Telamonian  Aias,  (8l1) 

Up  too  arose  great  Tydeus'  son,  the  brave  Diomedes. 
Each  retired  from  the  ring  to  arm,  apart  from  the  other; 
Then  came  forward  in  arms  complete  and  ready  for  combat, 
Fiercely  glaring.     Dread  and  amazement  seized  the  spectators. 
Slowly  at  first  they  approached,  but  soon  they  rushed  on  each  other, 
Thrice  advancing  fierce  to  the  charge,  thrice  closing  impetuous. 
Aias  first  through  the  smooth  round  orb  of  Diomed's  buckler 
Pierced,  but  the  weapon  reached  him  not,  being  stopped  by  the 

corslet. 
Mighty  Tydeides,  holding  the  beaming  point  of  his  jav'lin,  (820) 

High  advanced  o'er  the  huge  shield's  rim,  sought  the  neck  of  his  rival ; 
This  the  Greeks  when  in  dread  they  beheld,  for  the  life  of  the  chieftain 
Trembling,  implored  them  to  cease,  and  divide  the  prizes  between 

them. 
Yet  by  Achilles  to  Tydeus'  son  the  sword  was  awarded, 
Who,  with  the   scabbard    and  rich-wrought   belt,    from    the    hero 

received  it. 


Book  XXI H.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER,  519 

Next  for  a  prize  he  produced  a  huge  rough  ingot  of  iron, 
Erst  which  Eetion's  might  was  wont  to  poise,  and  to  hurl  it. 
Mighty  Eetion  slain  by  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles, 
This  in  the  victors'  ships  was  embarked,  with  all  his  possessions. 
Standing  erect,  the  Prince  these  words  addressed  to  the  Grecians  (830) 
"Stand  forth  all  who  in  this  rude  trial  of  strength  will  adventure. 
Far  as  his  fields  may  extend,  how  wide  soe'er  his  possessions, 
This  for  the  service  of  five  revolving  years  will  suffice  him, 
This  will  be  ready  at  hand,  nor  need  his  shepherd  or  ploughman 
Ever,  so  long  as  it  lasts,  to  the  town  resort  for  his  iron." 
Thus  he  spake.     Up  rose  then  the  war-renowned  Polypaetes, 
Up  too  arose  the  godlike  strength  of  mighty  Leonteus, 
Great  Telamonian  Aias  himself,  and  noble  Epeius. 
Ranged  in  order  they  stood.     Then  Epeius  seized  on  the  ingot, 
Swinging  it  round ;   but  it  flew  not  far,  and  the   Greeks  in   de- 
rision (840) 
Laughed.     Leonteus  next  essayed,  strong  scion  of  Ares; 
Then  with  his  stalwart  strength  the  great  Telamonian  Aias 
Raised  it,  and  hurled  it  far  beyond  the  marks  of  the  others. 
Last,  Polypcetes  came,  and  he  snatched  up  the  mass,  and  dispatched  it. 
Far  as  a  herdsman  flings  his  crook,  which  whirling  in  circles 
Far  in  advance  among  the  cows  alights  at  a  distance, 
So  far,  beyond,  Polypcetes  cast.     Loud  shouted  the  Argives; 
And  from  among  th'  applauding  crowd  advancing,  his  comrades 
Carried  away  to  their  hollow  ships  the  gift  of  the  monarch. 

Now  for  the  archers  were  prizes  set.  Steel  tempered  for  arrows,  (850) 
Ponderous  axes  ten,  and  an  equal  number  of  hatchets. 
Far  remote  on  the  sandy  shore  a  mast  was  erected, 
Borrowed  from  some  dark  ship,  and  a  tim'rous  dove  at  its  summit 
Flutt'ring,  was  tied  by  the  foot,  with  a  slender  band  to  confine  her. 
This  was  the  mark :  "  Whoe'er  yon  dove  shall  pierce  with  his  arrow 
His  be  the  axes.     Hence  let  him  take  and  home  let  him  bear  them ; 
Whoso,  missing  the  bird,  the  string  shall  divide,  as  a  marksman 
Lower  must  rank.     Be  his  the  inferior  prize  of  the  hatchets." 

Thus  he  spake.     Then  advanced  the  princely  presence  of  Teucer, 
Merion  too  stood  forth,  Idomeneus'  noble  attendant.  (860) 


$20 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIII. 


Into  a  brazen  casque  their  lots  they  cast,  and  when  shaken 
Teucer's  first  leaped  forth:  who  at  once,  without  loss  of  a  moment, 
Sent  forth  his  shaft  with  mighty  force:  nor  vowed  to  Apollo 
Hecatombs  pure  of  firstling  lambs,  to  propitiate  his  favour. 
Wherefore  the  bird  he  missed — for  Phcebus  grudged  him  the  honour; 
Close  to  her  foot  his  arrow  passed,  and  the  string  that  confined  her 
Severed  with  biting  edge.     Then  freed  at  once  from  her  fetters 
Off  to  the  skies  with  beating  wing  she  darted,  and  pendent 
Hung  down  the  mast  the  band.    With  delight  loud  shouted  the  Ar- 

gives. 
Merion  now,  receiving  the  bow  from  the  hand  of  his  rival,     (870) 
Eagerly  seized  it:  but  lingered  long  while  pointing  his  arrow, 
Keeping  his  eyes  on  the  bird,  while  he  inly  vowed  to  Apollo 
Hecatombs  pure  of  firstling  lambs,  to  propitiate  his  favour. 
Then,  as  beneath  the  clouds  high  wheeling  in  circle  on  circle 
Tow'ring  she  flew,  below  the  wing  with  his  arrow  he  pierced  her; 
Straight  through  her  body  passed  the  shaft :   then   turned,  and  de- 
scending, 
Fixed  in  the  ground  at  Merion's  feet.     The  dove  then  alighting   . 
Safe  for  a  moment  perched  on  the  lofty  mast,  till  exhausted, 
Drooping  her  neck  and  closing  her  flutt'ring  wings,  from  her  mem- 
bers 
Flitted  the  life  away ;  and  borne  by  the  wind  to  a  distance,    (880) 
Far  from  the  mast  she  dropped,  while  the  Greeks  stood  fixed  in 

amazement. 
Merion  the  axes  ten  then  claimed,  and  duly  received  them, 
Teucer  the  hatchets,  and  bore  them  off  and  stowed  in  his  vessel. 

Next  in  the  ring  Peleides  a  long-forth-shadowing  javelin 
Placed,  and  a  vase  with  sculptured  flow'rs  by  the  flames  unblacken'd 
Priced  at  an  ox.     To  contend  for  these  he  summoned  the  spearmen. 
Then  rose  Atreides  himself,  the  wide-ruling  king  Agamemnon ; 
Merion  next,  Idomeneus'  bold  and  faithful  attendant: 
Whom  when  he  saw,  he  advanced,  and  courteous  thus  he  addressed 

them : 
"  Mighty  Atreides,  far  before  all  thy  worth  we  acknowledge ;  (890) 
Prowess  and  strength  are  thine,  and  unmatched  renown  as  a  spearman.

Deign  uncontested  the  prize  to  accept,  to  thy  merit  accorded ; 
Bear  it  away  to  thy  ships,  and  to  Merion  the  spear  be  awarded : 
This  if  thou  so  permit,  and  approve  the  counsel  I  offer." 
Thus  he  spake.     At  once  with  his  wish  Agamemnon  complying, 
Handed  to  Merion  the  spear,  and  the  prize,  so  justly  awarded, 
Placed  in  Talthybius  the  herald's  hands  to  convey  to  the  vessels.

A  chilles  continuing  his  outrages  on  Heclor's  body,  the  gods  deliberate, 
and  Zeus  direcls  Thetis  to  intimate  to  her  son  his  will  that  it  should  be

TJ*  NDED  the  rites.    To  their  ships  and  tents  the  people  departed, 
•^  Each  to  his  own  retiring ;  and,  mindful  of  rest  and  refreshment, 
Food  they  partook  and  the  blessing  of  sweet  repose.    But  Achilles 
Only  retired  to  weep  for  his  much-lov'd  friend,  nor  did  slumber, 
All-subduing,  visit  his  eyes ;  but  hither  and  thither 
Tossing,  he  lay,  recalling  the  valour  and  might  of  Patroclus — 
All  their  adventures  together; — their  hardships  suffered  in  common; — 
Dangers  by  sea,  and  toils  by  land  in  the  conflict  of  heroes. 
All  these  things  when  his  thoughts  recalled,  warm  tears  in  abundance 
Moistened  his  couch;  now  turning  from  side  to  side ;  and  reclining  (10) 
Now  supine  on  his  back,  now  prone.     Then  restless,  uprising, 
Moaning  he  wandered  along  the  sands.    Nor,  wakeful,  escaped  him 
Earliest  gleams  of  dawn,  slow  tinting  the  shore  and  the  waters. 
Then  to  his  chariot  yoking  again  the  steeds,  and  attaching 
Once  more,  behind,  with  thongs  the  prostrate  body  of  Hector, 
Thrice  he  dragged  it  around  the  tomb  of  the  son  of  Menoetms, 
Then  to  his  tent  returned  and  slept :  first  flinging  the  body 
Flat  on  its  face  in  the  dust; — there  left  to  lie.     But  Apollo 
Kept  defilement  away;  in  his  soul  much  pitying  the  hero, 
Dead  as  he  was ;  and  o'er  him  his  aegis  of  gold  he  extended,     (20) 
Saving  his  limbs  from  bruise  or  wound  when  dragged  by  the  chariot. 

Thus  while  with  outrage  foul  he  wreaked  his  vengeance  on  Hector, 
Pity  and  grief  at  the  sight  possessed  the  blessed  immortals,

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Who  to  purloin  the  corpse  invited  the  slayer  of  Argus. 
This  was  approved  by  all  the  rest;  but  Poseidon  and  Here 
Sanclioned  it  not,  nor  the  blue-eyed  maid;  but  refused  their  permission, 
Stern  and  persistent  in  hate  :  for  Troy  from  the  first  they  detested, 
Priam  and  all  his  race,  for  the  crime  and  madness  of  Paris, 
When  in  his  woodland  home  those  two  great  Pow'rs  he  insulted, 
Slighting  their  charms  for  hers  to  his  lustful  passions  who  pandered.  (30) 
But  when  the  twelfth  returning  dawn  enlightened  Olympus, 
Phoebus  endured  that  sight  no  more,  but  addressed  the  immortals : 
"Cruel,  unjust  in  this  are  ye  all,  ye  Gods!    Did  not  Hector 
Ever  before  your  shrines  the  thighs  of  lambs  and  of  oxen 
Burn  ?   and  ye  still  refuse  his  remains  to  rescue  from  outrage; 
Give  them  again  to  the  sight  of  his  longing  wife,  of  his  mother, 
Priam  his  wretched  father,  his  infant  child,  and  his  people, 
Funeral  rites  to  perform,  and  with  sacred  fires  to  consume  them ! 
Why  will  ye  favour  thus,  ye  Gods  !  infuriate  Achilles, 
One  in  whose  soul  is  no  sense  of  right  ?    No  thought  of  relenting  (40) 
Ever  in  that  stern  breast  finds  place :  intent,  like  a  lion 
Always  on  savage  deeds,  who  with  headlong  force  in  his  fury 
Flings  himself  on  the  shepherds'  flocks  to  tear  and  devour  them. 
Thus  hath  Achilles  cast  all  pity  aside — hath  forgotten 
Shame,  that  abounding  source  of  good  and  of  evil  to  mortals. 
What  though  a  man  by  death  from  his  dearest  friend  may  be  parted, 
What  though  he  mourn  the  loss  of  a  son  belov'd,  or  a  brother, 
Bitter  at  first  though  his  tears,  yet  time  assuages  his  sorrows. 
Fate,  that  inflicls  the  blow,  gives  the  patient  mind  that  endures  it. 
Here  we  have  one  who,  not  co?itent  with  slaught'ring  his  foeman,    (50) 
Day  after  day  round  the  tomb  of  his  friend  continues  to  drag  him. 
This  is  no  lovely  sight,  ?io  goodly  and  noble  example! 
Let  him  beware,  lest,  brave  as  he  is,  he  incur  our  displeasure, 
Outraging  thus  the  senseless  clay  in  his  madness  of  passion." 

Fired  at  his  words,  indignant,  the  white-armed  Hera  responded  : 
"  Lord  of  the  silver  bow  1    such  words  were  just  and  appropriate 
Couldst  thou  ascribe  an  equal  worth  to  Achilles  and  Hector : 
Hector,  a  mortal,  fed  from  the  nurturing  breast  of  a  woman  ; 
Mighty  Achilles,  goddess-born,  whose  mother  I  cherished, 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  §    527 

Reared,  instructed,  and  gave  to  a  noble  mortal  in  wedlock,     (60) 
Peleus,  belov'd  of  all  the  Gods,  most  godlike  in  spirit. 
Have  ye  forgotten,  ye  Pow'rs,  how  ye  all  attended  the  bridal  ? 
Thou  too  wert  there  with  thy  harp :    thou  friend   of  the  wicked  ! 

thou  false  one  !" 
Then  interposing,  Zeus,  the  cloud-compeller,  addressed  her : 
"  Hera,  forbear !  nor  vent  thy  rage  before  all  the  immortals. 
Equals  in  glory  and  rank  those  chiefs  were  not.    Yet  to  Hector 
Far  before  all  in  Troy  was  our  favour  due,  and  protection : 
Chief,  from  myself;  for  ne'er  did  he  fail  in  his  gifts  and  his  worship, 
Dear  to  my  soul ;  nor  was  e'er  the  accustomed  feast  at  my  altars 
Lacking — sweet  incense  or  sav'ry  steams  :  fit  service,  and  welcome.  (70) 
As  for  purloining  the  corse — I  forbid  it.    Nor  from  Achilles 
Could  we  conceal  such  theft  of  his  valiant  foe ;  for  his  mother 
Watches  around  him  night  and  day,  nor  quits  for  an  instant. 
One  of  you  go,  seek  Thetis,  and  summon  her  here  to  my  presence, 
Wholesome  advice  will  I  give  her,  and  so  shall  she  coimsel  Achilles 
Ransom  from  Priam  to  take,  and  restore  the  body  of  Hector." 
Thus  he  spake.    Then  Iris  arose,  and,  swift  as  the  whirlwind, 
Sped  with  the  message  away.    'Twixt  the  rocks  of  Imbrus  and  Samos 
Half-way,  plunged  in  the  darksome  sea,  which,  roaring,  engulphed 

her, 
Headlong  she  shot,  down,  down  in  the  deep  abyss  :  as  a  plummet,  (80) 
Dropped  through  the  guiding  horn  of  an  ox,  sinks  down  in  the  waters, 
Bearing  insidious  death  to  the  hungry  shoals  of  the  fishes. 
Thetis  she  found  in  a  hollow  cave,  where  round  her  had  gathered 
Many  an  ocean  nymph.    In  their  midst  she  sate  and  lamented, 
Weeping,  the  fate  of  her  noble  son  who,  far  from  his  country, 
Soon  before  Troy  must  end  his  career  of  conquest  and  glory. 
Closely  the  goddess  approaching,  the  swift-wing' d  Iris  addressed  her : 
"Thetis,  arise.     High  counsels  of  Zeus  demand  thy  attendance." 
Then  in  her  turn  the  silver-footed  goddess  responded : 
"  What  may  import  this  call  from  so  mighty  a  God  ?  in  Olympus  (90) 
All  unfit  to  appear,  I  shrink :  for  grief  overwhelms  me. 
Yet  will  I  come.    No  word  from  Zeus  may  pass  unregarded." 
Thus  as  she  spake  a  sable  mantle  enfolded  the  goddess

[Book  XXIV. 


Dark  as  the  gloom  of  blackest  night,  or  the  shadows  of  Orcus. 
Iris  swift  as  the  winds  before  her  went,  and  around  them 
Shrank,  making  way  as  they  passed,  the  curling  waves  of  the  Ocean. 
Swift  up  the  shelving  strand  they  swept,  then  aloft  to  Olympus 
Darted ;  and  there  th'  all-seeing  king  they  found,  and  th'  immortals 
All  assembled,  and  ranged  in  solemn  conclave  around  him. 
Pallas  arose,  and  making  room,  by  the  throne  of  the  Father         (ioo) 
Placed  her.    Hera  presented  a  golden  and  beauteous  goblet, 
Soothing  her  grief  with  gentle  words.    She  drank  and  returned  it. 
Then  in  these  words  addressed  her  the  Father  of  Gods  and  of  mortals  : 
"Thetis  divine  !    Full  well  I  know  how  bitter  a  sorrow 
Weighs  on  thy  heart,  and  pursues  thee  e'en  to  the  courts  of  Olympus  : 
Yet  must  thou  learn  the  cause  why  thus  I  require  thy  attendance. 
Nine  days  now  hath  dissension  prevailed  among  the  immortals 
Touching  the  corse  of  Hector  slain  :  and  this  their  proposal — - 
Hermes  to  send,  from  Achilles,  waster  of  towns,  to  purloin  it. 
This  I  forbade,  from  regard  to  thy  love  for  thy  son,  and  his  glory,  (no) 
Best  secured  by  subduing  himself,  and  conqu'ring  his  passion. 
Go  then  at  once  to  the  camp  :  with  Achilles  reason,  and  tell  him 
How  to  the  gods  he  gives  offence — how  my  anger  is  kindled 
Chief  above  all,  when  his  frantic  rage  I  behold — when  I  see  him 
Thus  detaining  the  corse  of  his  foe ;  nor  accepting  its  ransom. 
Bid  hi?n  at  once  desist  if  he  fear  my  wrath,  and  restore  him. 
Iris  the  while  to  Priam,  from  me  dispatched,  shall  persuade  him 
Gifts  to  prepare,  which  may  soften  the  stubborn  heart  of  Achilles, 
And  to  his  ships  to  repair  in  suppliant  guise,  to  implore  him." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  the  silver-footed  goddess  obeyed  him.       (120) 
Down  from  Olympus'  lofty  crests  she  plunged  on  the  instant, 
And  at  the  tent  of  her  son  arrived.     There  sorr'wing  she  found  him, 
Venting  his  grief  in  incessant  moans.     Around  him  his  comrades 
Busied   themselves  in   preparing   a   meal   for  their  chief,   and   had 

slaughtered 
There  in  the  tent  a  thick-fleeced  sheep  to  furnish  the  banquet. 
Down  sate  his  mother  august  beside  him,  and  fondly  caressing, 
Laid  on  his  hand  her  own,  and  endearingly  named,  and  bespoke  him  : 
"Wilt  thou  for  ever,  my  son,  let  grief  and  bitter  affliction 


Book  XXIV.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


529 


Prey  on  thy  heart,  neglectful  of  needful  food  and  of  slumber  ? 
Even  the  charms  of  thy  lov'd  Brise'is  fail  to  delight  thee!  (130) 

Waste  not  the  few  short  days  thou  hast  yet  to  live  :  for,  bethink  thee, 
Fate  which  thou  canst  not  resist,  and  death,  stand  close  at  thy  elbow. 
Mark  then  my  words.     Attend  !  from  Zeus  I  bear  thee  a  warning, 
That  to  the  Gods  thou  giv'st  offence — that  his  anger  is  kindled, 
Chief,  above  all,  when  thy  frantic  rage  he  beholds — when  he  sees  thee 
Still  detaining  the  corse  of  thy  foe,  and  refusing  to  yield  it : 
Wherefore  he  bids  thee  restore  the  dead,  accepting  the  ransom." 
Then  making  answer  replied  the  swift-pursuing  Achilles  : 
"So  let  it  be.     Let  them  take  the  body,  and  bring  me  the  ransom, 
If,  as  thou  say'st,  Olympian  Zeus  in  his  wisdom  ordains  it."  (140) 

Thus  they  conferred,  amid  the  close  ranged  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Mother  and  son  :  and  long  they  talked,  consoling  each  other. 
Iris  for  Troy  set  forth  with  this  command  from  Kronfon  : 
"Haste  thee  away,  swift  Iris  !  and,  quitting  the  heights  of  Olympus, 
Seek  out  the  wretched  Priam  in  Troy,  and  this  message  deliver  : 
Bid  him  prepare  rich  gifts  which  may  soften  the  heart  of  Achilles, 
And  to  his  ships  in  suppliant  guise  repair,  and  implore  him. 
Forth  let  him  fare  alone,  nor  take  one  Trojan  attendant. 
Only  some  herald,  old  and  revered,  should  follow  his  chariot, 
Guiding  another  car,  with  mules,  to    convey  to   the    city,  (150) 

Slowly,  the  sad  remains  of  the  hero  slain  by  Achilles. 
Nor  for  his  life  is  cause  for  fear,  nor  aught  to  alarm  him, 
Such  and  so  sure  a  guide  shall  attend  him — the  slayer  of  Argus, 
Who  to  Achilles'  presence  and  tent  will  safely  conduct  him. 
Once  in  his  presence  arrived,   once  safe  in  the  tent  of  Achilles, 
Nor  will  he  slay  him  himself,  nor  suffer  another  to  harm  him, 
Nor  is  he  void  of  sense,  nor  utterly  reckless,  or  brutal. 
Touched  with  compassion,  his  heart  will  melt  when  suppliant  he  sees 

him." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  darting  down  at  the  palace  of  Priam 
Iris  arrived.     There  nought  she  found  but  sorrow  and  wailing —  (160) 
There,  in  the  porch,  round  the  wretched  father  his  sons  were  assembled, 
Seated,  and  drenching  their  robes  with  tears.     In  the  midst  was  the 

old  man,

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Close  in  a  mantle  enwrapped  that  his  form  revealed ;  and  by  handfuls 
Dirt  on  his  head,  his  neck,  and  his  hoary  beard,  was   encrusted, 
Clutched  with  his  hands  and  tossed  aloft  as  he  rolled  on  the  pavement. 
Wide  through  the  palace  around  resounded  the  cries  of  his  daughters, 
And  of  the  widowed  brides  of  his  slaughtered  sons,  who  in  battle, 
Many  and  brave,  had  fall'n,  recalled  to  bitter  remembrance. 
Iris  approached,  and  in  tones  subdued  and  gentle,  to  Priam 
Thus  her  mission  announced ;  while  the  old  King  trembled  with  ter- 
ror:  C1?0) 
"  Be  not  afraid,  Dardanian  Priam !    summon  thy  courage. 
Not  to  announce  fresh  woes,  or  to  bring  thee  tidings  of  evil, 
Only  for  good  I  come.     From  Zeus  I  bear  thee  a  message, 
Who  from  above  looking  down,  with  grace  and  with  pity  beholds  thee. 
Ransom  for  He 61  or  he  bids  thee  take,  and  suppliant  to  offer 
Gifts,  which  may  soothe  the  pride  and  soften  the  heart  of  Achilles. 
Forth  must  thou  fare  alone,  nor  take  one  Trojan  attendant. 
Only  some  herald,  old  and  revered,  must  follow  thy  chariot, 
Guiding  another  car  with  mules,  to  convey  to  the  city, 
Slowly,  the  sad  remains  of  the  hero  slain  by  Achilles.              (T8o) 
Nor  for  thy  life  is  cause  for  fear,  nor  aught  to  alarm  thee ; 
Such  and  so  sure  a  guide  wilt  thou  find  in  the  slayer  of  Argus, 
Who  to  Achilles'  presence  and  tent  will  safely  conduct  thee. 
Once  in  his  presence  arrived,  once  safe  in  the  tent  of  Achilles, 
Nor  will  he  slay  thee  himself,  nor  suffer  another  to  hurt  thee. 
Nor  is  he  void  of  sense,  nor  utterly  reckless  and  brutal. 
Touched  with    compassion,  his    heart   will  melt  when  suppliant   he 

sees  thee." 
Thus  her  message  delivered,  the  swift-wing'd  Iris  departed. 
Priam  arose,  and  a  mule-drawn  car  his  sons  he  commanded 
Straight  to   prepare,    and   on  it   a   coffer   to  bind.     To  his  cham- 
ber, ('190) 
Then  he  repaired,  of  cedar  built,  high  roofed,  and  with  odours 
Richly  perfumed,  and  filled  with  rare  and  beauteous  treasures. 
Hecuba  then,  his  much  lov'd  wife,  he  called,  and  addressed  her : 
"  Hear  me,  unhappy  one  !  Zeus  from  heav'n  hath  sent  me  a  message. 
Forth  to  the  Grecian  camp  he  commands  me  to  go,  and  to  ransom 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  531 

Hector,   and  take  such  gifts  as  may  soften  the  heart  of  Achilles. 
Tell  me  now,  what  in  thy  inmost  heart  thou  think'st  of  the  matter. 
Strong  is  the  impulse  I  feel,  and  great  my  desire  to  attempt  it ; 
Forth  to  fare,  and  to  seek  the  ships  and  camp  of  the  Grecians." 
Thus  he  spake  ;  and  his  wife  with  sobs  this  answer  returned  him  : 
"  Where  is  thy  wisdom  now,  the  foresight  keen,  and  the  prudence,     (201) 
Which  among  nations  afar,  and  thy  subjects,  made  thee  respected? 
How  canst  thou  go  alone  to  the  hostile  ships  of  the  Grecians? 
How  canst  thou  look  on  the  face  of  him  who  murdered  thy  children, 
Many  and  brave  ?  a  heart  of  steel  must  thou  bear  in  thy  bosom  ! 
For,  should  that  faithless  wretch,  that  raw-devouring  monster, 
Set  but  his  eyes   on  thee,  thou  art  lost.     No  touch  of  compassion, 
Rev'rence,  or  shame,  would  hold  his  hand.     No  !  here  in  our  palace 
Give  we  our  days  to  tears  :  since,  ev'n  in  the  hour  that  I  bore  him, 
Fate    had    entwined   him   round   in   her   nascent   thread,    and   had 
marked  him  (2I°) 

Prey  for  devouring  dogs,  far,  far  from  his  desolate  parents, 
There  in  the  power  of  that  stern  man.     Oh  !  would  I  could  grapple 
Fast  to  his  heart  and  tear  it  out  with  my  teeth — a  requital 
Fit,  for  his  deeds  against  my  son :   whom  not  like  a  coward 
Flinching,   he   slew,    but   in   arms   for   the    deep-bosomed   matrons 

of  Troia, 
And   for   their   husbands  and   sons  :    nor   dreamed  he    of  flight   or 

evasion." 
Then  in  his  turn  that  old  and  godlike  monarch  responded  : 
"  Cease  to  dissuade  me.     Cease,  like  an  ill-omened  bird  in  my  palace, 
Woes  to  firedicl,   and  ill  success;   for  thou  shalt  not  withhold  me. 
Had  it  been  any  other,  a  dweller  on  earth  and  a  mortal,  (220) 

Prophet,  or  priest,  or  seer,  who  had  told  me  this,  I  had  listened, 
All  unbelieving,  and  turned  away,  rejecting  his  counsel. 
But  since  the  heav'nly  voice  I  have  heard  with  mine  ears,  and  the  god- 
dess 
Face  to  face  have  beheld,  I  go  :  nor  in  vain  hath  she  spoken. 
If  at  the  ships  of  the  bronze-mailed  Greeks  I  be  destined  to  perish, 
So  let  it  be.     Embracing  the  corse  of  my  son  shall  he  slay  me, 
Easing  my  bursting  heart  of  its  pent-up  grief  on  his  bosom."

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Thus  he  spake,  and  op'ning  the  beauteous  lids  of  his  coffers, 
Twelve  wrought  robes  from  his  stores  of  exceeding  richness  and  beauty, 
Tunics  as  many,  and  mantles  twelve,  of  tapestried  carpets  (230) 

Twelve,  and  of  shawls  without  fold  an  equal  number,  selected ; 
Weighed  out  next '  ten  talents  of  gold,  full  weight ;  in  addition, 
Glittering  tripods  twain,  and  four  great  vases  of  silver; 
Crowning  the  gifts  with  a  goblet  of  wondrous  work,  which  the  Thracians 
Gave  him,  when  once  on  a  mission  sent : — a  princely  possession. 
Nor  did  he  spare  ev'n  this,  nor  were  aught  in  his  palace  too  costly, 
Might  he  but  ransom  his  much-lov'd  son.     From  the  porch  which  the 

Trojans 
Crowded,  he  drove  them  all  away  with  abuse  and  reproaches  : 
"  Off  with  ye  !    Hence  !  ye  wretches,  ye  worthless  scum  of  the  city  ! 
Have   ye   not   sorrows    enough    of   your    own    that   ye    come    to 

annoy  me  ?  (240) 

Is  it  so  trifling  a  grief  in  your  sight,  what  angry  Kronion 
Sends  me,  to  lose  my  bravest  son?     You  will  all  of  you  feel  it, 
When  ye  shall  fall  an  easier  prey  to  the  swords  of  the  Argives, 
He,  your  defender,  snatched  away.     Oh!  first  let  me  perish, 
First  let  me  tread  the  downward  path  to  the  mansion  of  Hades 
Ere  with  these  eyes  I  behold  the  ruin  and  spoil  of  the  city." 
Thus  while  he  spake,  with  his  staff  he  drove  them  away.     From  his 

presence 
Slunk  they,  abashed  at  so  vast  a  grief.    On  his  sons  then  he  turned 

him, 
Chiding,  with  bitter  reproach:  upon  Helenus,  Agathon,  Paris, 
Pammon,   Hippothoiis,  great  in  the  roar  of  battle  Polites,         (250) 
Dios  the  noble,  Deiphobus,  Antiphon,  all  were  included : 
All  those  nine  whom  the  sword  had  spared;  and  thus  he  reviled  them : 
"Hither!  make  haste!  ye  shameful  and  lazy  crew!  would  to  heaven 
There  at  the  ships,  one  and  all,  in  Hector's  stead  ye  had  perished! 
Wretch  that  I  am !  most  wretched !  what  sons  were  mine !  throughout 

Troia 
Noblest,  bravest,  and  best!  and  now — not  one  of  them  left  me! 
Mestor,  how  like  a  god!  and  Troilus,  valiant  in  battle, 
Car-borne;  Hector,  a  god  among  men:  for  who  that  beheld  him, 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  533 

E'er  would  suppose  him  of  mortal  mould,  the  son  of  a  mortal? 
These  hath  the  pow'r  of  Ares  destroyed.   But  you  hath  he  left  me,  (260) 
Blots  on  my  name :  a  knot  of  buffoons,  deceivers,  and  dancers, 
Greedy  devourers  of  lambs  and  kids,  that  ye  wring  from  the  people. 
Will  ye  make  haste,  I  say !  and  get  ready  the  car,  as  T  bade  you  ? 
Load  on  it  all  these  things,  and  let  me  depart  on  my  errand." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  his  sons  the  chiding  voice  of  their  father 
Dreading,  drew  forth  in  the  palace  court  the  beauteous  mule-wain 
Xew-built,  strong  in  the  wheels;  then  strapped  upon  it  the  coffer. 
Then  from  its  peg  the  box-wood  yoke  for  the  mules  they  dismounted, 
All  with  bosses  adorned,  and  with  rings  provided;  and  brought  forth 
Next,    with    the    yoke,    the    yoke-band    strong.       Nine    cubits    it 

measured.  (27°) 

This  round  the  end  of  the  polished  pole  they  bound,  and  adjusted, 
Fast'ning  it  well  with  a  bolt  and  ring;  then  deftly  they  wound  it 
Thrice  each  way  round  the   boss    of  the   yoke   and  the  pole,    and 

compactly 
Fastened  it  off,  and  turned  in  the  end  of  the  strap  to  secure  it. 
Then    from    the    chamber   within    they   fetched   the   presents — the 

priceless 
Ransom  of  Hector's  head,  and  stowed  them  safe  in  the  coffer. 
Lastly  the  strong  laborious  mules,  by  the  Mysians  presented 
Freely  to  Priam,  a  valued  gift,  they  led  forth  and  harnessed, 
And  for  the  chariot  of  Priam  himself  brought  forth  from  the  stable 
Steeds,  which  the  old  man's  hand  had  supplied  with  food  in  their 

mangers.  (280) 

These  in  the  lofty  palace-court  the  herald  and  Priam 
Harnessed,  lending  their  hearts  and  hands  to  the  bus'ness  before  them. 
Hecuba  now  approached,  and,  saddened  with  anxious  forebodings, 
Held  in  her  right  hand  forth  a  golden  cup,  for  libation 
Due  to   the   Gods,    of  the   honey-sweet  wine,   ere   they   took  their 

departure. 
Standing  in  front  of  the  car,  her  husband  she  named,  and  addressed 

him: 
"Take  it,  and  duly  pour  unto  father  Zeus,  and  beseech  him 
Safe  to  permit  thy  return  from  the  foe;  if,  despising  my  counsel

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Sorely  against  my  will,  thou  art  still  determined  to  venture. 
Yet  be  thy  prayer  preferred  to  the  cloud-compelling  Kronion,      (290) 
Him,  who  from  Ida's  heights  surveys  thy  realm  and  thy  city, 
That  he  will  deign  to  send  thee  his  bird,  his  favourite  eagle, 
Mightiest  of  all  the  feathered  race,  that  thine  eyes  may  behold  him, 
Soaring  aloft  on  the  right;    and  on  that  sure  token  relying 
Fearless  then   thou   may'st   shape   thy  course  for  the   ships  of  the 

Grecians. 
But  should  allseeing  Zeus  withhold  this  sign,  and  his  eagle 
Send  not,  not  from  my  lips  shalt  thou  hear  one  word  of  persuasion 
Forth  to  the  Grecian  ships  to  fare,  be  thou  ever  so  eager." 
Then  making  answer  in  turn,  the  godlike  Priam  responded: 
"What  thou  proposest  is  surely  right.    Such  advice  I  reject  not.  (300) 
Good  is  it  ever  to  Zeus  to  pray,  who  is  full  of  compassion." 

Thus  spake  the  hoary  sire,  and  gave  a  sign  to  the  handmaid, 
Standing  near,  with  basin  and  ewer  in  hand  for  ablution, 
Water  pure  on  his  hands  to  pour.     He  washed  and  was  cleansed  : 
Then  from  his  spouse  received  the  cup,  ere  he  mounted  his  chariot, 
Standing  erect  in  the  midst  of  the  court,  and  poured  his  libation, 
Raising  his  eyes  to  heav'n  :  and  this  the  prayer  that  he  offered : 
"  Father  Zeus  !   most  great,  most  glorious,  throned  upon  Ida ! 
Grant  me  a  kind  reception  and  grace  in  the  sight  of  Achilles ; 
And  to  confirm  it,  send  me  thy  messenger-bird,  thine  eagle,         (310) 
Mightiest  of  all  the  feathered  race,  that  mine  eyes  may  behold  him, 
Soaring  aloft  on  the  right ;  and  on  that  sure  token  relying, 
Fearless,  my  course  I    may  shape    to    the    camp    and  ships  of  the 
Grecians." 

Such  was  his  prayer  :  and  it  reached  the  favouring  ear  of  Kronion. 
Forthwith  his  eagle  he  sent,  the  best  and  surest  of  omens, 
Dark  wing'd,  the  mighty  hunter,  as  Percnos  known  in  Olympus. 
Wide  as  the  folding  doors  of  some  lofty  room  in  a  palace 
Fly,  when  its  wealthy  owner  withdraws  their  bolts  to  admit  him, 
Such  and  so  vast  were  his  wide-out-spreading  wings,  as  he  hovered 
High  on  the  right  o'er  the  town,  and  they  all  rejoicing  beheld  him  : 
Comfort  and  hope,  by  the  sight  inspir'd,  reviving  within  them.       (321) 

Now,  without  more  delay,  the  old  king  mounted  the  chariot, 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  535 

Forth  from  the  court  it  rolled,  and  beneath  the  echoing  portal 
Out  first  passed  the  mules  with  the  four-wheel'd  wain,  by  Idaeus 
Driv'nj  and  behind  them  Priam  himself  his  chariot  and  horses, 
Briskly  along  with  uplifted  scourge  through  the  streets  of  the  city, 
Guided.     His  sorrowing  friends  at  a  distance  followed,  lamenting, 
As  for  a  man  going  forth  to  death,  and  courting  destruction. 

Now  when  the  town  they  left,  and  down  to  the  plain  were  descend- 
ing, 
All  his  sons  and  his    sons-in-law  returned  to  the  city.  (33°) 

Journeying  on,  thenceforth  alone,  on  the  plain  they  proceeded, 
Not  unobserved  by  all-seeing  Zeus,  who,  moved  with  compassion, 
Hermes  summoned,  his  much-lov'd  son ;  and  thus  he  addressed  him : 
"  Hermes  !    ever  with  mortals  thou  lov'st  to  mix  and  associate, 
List'ning  to  all  their  prayers,  and  mov'd  by  their  joys  and  their  sorrows: 
Go  now,    Priam  conduct  to  the  hollow  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
So  that  not  one  of  them  all  may  mark  his  course,  or  suspect  him, 
Guiding  him  safe  through  the  camp  till  he  reach  the  tent  of  Achilles." 
Such  his  command.     Not  a  moment  delayed  the  slayer  of  Argus. 
Under  his  feet  he  bound  those  rich  and  marvellous  sandals,  (34°) 

Golden,  ambrosial,  borne  by  which  he  skims  o'er  the  ocean, 
And  o'er  the  boundless  realms  of  earth,  with  the  speed  of  the  tempest ; 
Grasping  his  mighty  rod,  whose  strange   mysterious  power 
Closes  in  sleep  all  mortal  eyes  or  awakes  at  his  pleasure. 
Thus  for  his  errand  equipped,  down  darted  the  slayer  of  Argus, 
Soon  at  the  Hellespont  broad  he  arrived  and  the  region  of  Troia, 
There  assuming  the  form  of  a  noble  youth,  into  manhood 
Ent'ring,  in  life's  first  bloom,  and  graceful  in  gait  and  demeanour. 

Now  unto  Ilus'  lofty  mound  were  they  come,  and  a  moment 
Rested  the  horses  and  mules,  and  allowed  them  drink  from  the  river: 
Xow  had  already  the  twilight  fair  11  and  darkened 'the  prospect,     (351) 
When,  in  the  gloom  looking  forth,  the  herald  perceived  from  a  distance 
Hermes  approaching:  alarmed,  to  Priam  he  called,  and  addressed  him: 
"Dardanus'  offspring,  beware!  here  is  that  which  calls  for  decision. 
Not  far  off  a  foe  I  perceive,  who  I  fear  will  destroy  us. 
Say,  were  it  better  to  turn  thy  car  and  fly  for  our  safety, 
Or  at  his  feet  to  fall,  and  prostrate  crave  his  compassion?" 


536 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Thus  he  spake,  but  the  old  man  stood,  confounded  with  terror. 
Bristling  arose  each  hair,  and  his  bent  knees  quivered  beneath  him. 
Thus    while    amazed    and    astound   he    stood,    up    came   the    Pro- 
teaor,  (360) 

Took  the  old  king  by  the  trembling  hand,  and  kindly  addressed  him : 
"  Where,   my   good    father,   thus   with   horses   and    mules    art   thou 

journeying, 
Now,  at  the  fall  of  ambrosial  night,  when  others  are  slumb'ring? 
Dost  thou  not  fear  the  Greeks,  who,  breathing  vengeance,  are  nigh  thee  : 
Hostile   to  all  thy  race,  and  detesting  the  name  of  a  Trojan — 
Whom  shouldst  thou  meet,  thus  carrying  off  that  wainload  of  treasure 
All    through  the  dark    and    dang'rous   night,  dost  thou   think   they 

would  spare  thee  ? 
Young  thou  art  not  thyself,  nor  would  this  old  guide  for  protection 
Aught  avail,  should  one  of  their  host  approach  to  assault  thee. 
But  be  assured,  I  will  harm  thee  not,  nor  in  any  wise  suffer  (370) 

Others  do  thee  wrong :    thou  remind'st  me   so  of  my  father." 
Thus  in  his  turn  the  godlike  Priam  replied,  and  addressed  him : 
"  All  thou  hast  said,  my  son,  is  true.     Yet  still,  to  protect  me, 
Surely  some  god  with  pitying  care  his  hand  hath  extended, 
Sending  so  gentle  and  kind  a  guide  to  meet  and  conduct  me, 
Wondrously  beauteous  in  feature  and  form.     Nor  less  in  thy  bearing 
Shines  forth  a  generous  soul.     A  joy  must  thou  be  to  thy  parents." 

Hermes  thus  in  his  turn  replied,  the  celestial  envoy : 
"Just  are  thy  words  and  fair,  old  man,  and  prudently  spoken. 
Tell  me  however,  and  tell  me  true  :   for  what  art  thou  carrying,    (380) 
Forth  from  the  city  to  foreign  lands,  such  costly  possessions? 
Is  it  thy  single  wealth  thou  would'st  save  ?  or,  one  among  many, 
Com'st  thou,   deserting  with  all  the  rest  thine  Irian  city, 
Dreading  its  fall;  thy  son  being  dead,  its  noble  defender, 
Bravest  of  all,  and  a  worthy  match  for  the  sons  of  Achaia?" 

Then  in  his  turn  the  godlike  Priam  replied  and  addressed  him  : 
"Who  then  art  thou,  thou  noble  youth,  and  who  were  thy  parents, 
Who  of  the  death  of  my  hapless  son  thus  touchingly  speakest?" 
Thus  then  the  slayer  of  Argus  replied,  the  celestial  envoy  :  (389) 

"Much  dost  thou  tempt  me,  O  sire,  to  speak  the  praises  of  Hector. 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  537 

Oft  with  these  eyes  have  I  seen  him  engaged  in  glorious  battle, 
What  time  he    drove   before   him   the    Greeks   to  their   ships,  and, 

pursuing, 
Smote  them  with  sword  and  spear.     And  we,  meanwhile  at  a  distance, 
Wond'ring  gazed  :  for  Achilles  then,  enraged  with  Atreides, 
Suffered  us  not  in  the  fight  to  join,  or  lend  them  assistance. 
Him  do  I  serve.     One  ship  conveyed  us  hither  from  Phthia. 
Sprung  from  a  Myrmidon  race,  my  sire  is  the  noble  Poly6tor. 
Wealthy  he  is  and  advanced  in  years  like,  thyself.     Of  his  offspring 
Youngest  am  I.     There  are  six  beside.     Myself  am  the  seventh. 
Lots  were  cast,    and  on  me  it  fell  to  sail  with  Achilles.  (400) 

Now  am  I  sent  from  the  ships  to  watch  on  the  plain ;  for  at  daybreak, 
Once  more  in  arms  the  keen-eyed  Greeks  will  assault  your  defences. 
Chafed  with  their  long  inaclion  impatient  they  sit,  and  their  leaders 
Scarce  can  their  ardour  restrain,  and  their  eager  longing  for  battle." 
Then  in  his  turn  the   godlike  Priam  replied,  and   addressed  him  : 
"  If  thou  be  really  one  of  Achilles'  train,  thou  canst  tell  me — 
(And  /  beseech  thee,  declare  to  me  all  the  truth,  nor  disguise  it) 
Whether  the  corse  of  my  son  be  still  at  the  ships,   or  Achilles 
Piecemeal  hath  hewn,  and  cast  to  his  dogs  to  tear  and  devour  it?" 

Thus  then  the  slayer  of  Argus  replied,  the  celestial  envoy:  (410) 
"  Neither  the  dogs  nor  birds  of  the  air  have  ventured  to  touch  it. 
There  at  the  tent  he  still  remains  by  the  ship  of  Achilles, 
Fresh  as  in  life  :   though  twelve  returning  dawns  have  arisen 
Since  he  hath  lain  there,  uncorrupt.     No  worm  hath  defiled  him, 
Such  as  consume  the  remains  of  those  who  perish  in  battle. 
He,  as  his  wont  hath  been,  with  the  earliest  glimpse  of  the  twilight, 
Ruthless,  will  drag  the  corse  round  the  tomb  of  his  buried  companion. 
Yet  he  defiles  him  not.     Approaching,  still  thou  wouldst  find  him 
Fresh  as  the  morning  dew ;  most  strange  to  behold.     From  about  him 
All  the  blood  hath  been  cleansed.     No  foulness  is  there.     On  his 
person  (420) 

Every  wound  is  healed  :  yet  with  many  a  spear  did  they  pierce  him  ! 
Such  for  thy  noble  son  is  the  care  of  the  blessed  immortals : 
Such  their  regard  for  the  dead,  whom  living  they  loved  for  his  virtues." 

Thus  he  spake,  and  rejoicing  at  heart  old  Priam  responded : 


538  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXIV. 


"See,  my  child,    how  good  it  is  to  pay  to  th'  immortals 
Honours  and  offrings  due  j   for  ne'er  did  my  son  in  his  palace 
Ever  forget  or  neglect  the  gods  who  dwell  in  Olympus  : 
Wherefore  in  death  itself  they  bear  him  in  mind,  and  protect  him. 
Now  at  my  hands  I  pray  thee  accept  this  beauteous  goblet. 
Keep   me    from    harm;    and   hence   (under   Heav'n's    good  favour) 
conduct  me,  (43°) 

Safe  on  my  way,  till  I  reach,  by  thy  aid,  the  tent  of  Achilles." 
Promptly  replying,  thus  rejoined  the  slayer  of  Argus : 
"  Fain  would'st  thou  tempt  me,  reverend  sire  !  but  shalt  not  persuade  me, 
Young  though  I  am,  to  accept  thy  gifts,  unknown  to  Achilles. 
Him  have  I  much  in  dread,  and  should  hold  it  shameful  to  rob  him, 
Nor  do  I  dare  :  for  mischief  hereafter  would  surely  befall  me. 
Yet  will  I  be  thy  guide.     Most  carefully  even  to  Argos 
Would  I  conduct  thee ;  by  sea  or  by  land  would  watch  o'er  thy  safety. 
Few  would  be  found  to  attack  thee  despising  such  a  protector." 
Thus  spake  the  helpful  god :  with  a  bound  then  leaped  on  the  chariot, 
Deftly   seizing   the    reins    and    the    scourge,    and    lashed    on    the 
horses ;  (44 1) 

Them    and    the    mules   with    spirit   inspiring   and    strength  for  the 
journey. 
Now   had    they  reached    the    Grecian   lines,   the  trench  and  the 
rampart, 
Busily  where  for  their  ev'ning  meal  the  guards  were  preparing, 
When  upon  all  deep  sleep  there  fell,  by  the  slayer  of  Argus 
Poured  on  their  lids.      Wide  flew  the  gates,  unbarred  and  unbolted. 
In  roll'd,  with  Priam,  the  car,  and  the  costly  gifts  .on  the  mulewain. 
Thus  they  at  length  arrived  at  the  lofty  tent  of  Achilles, 
Which  for  the  use  of  their  prince  the  Myrmidon  host  had  constructed, 
Strong   fir-posts    had    they   hewn   and    infixed,    for    the   walls;    and 
upon  them  (45°) 

Reared  a  thick  roof  of  thatch,  with  reeds  mown  down  in  the  marshes. 
Round  it  an  ample  court  they  enclosed ;  and  planted,  to  fence  it, 
Huge  palisades.     With  a  single  beam  was  fastened  the  postern, 
Massive  and  vast.     To  uprear  that  bar  three  sons  of  Achaia 
Hardly  availed,  and  three  that  enormous  bolt  to  unfasten, 


Book  XXIV.] 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


539 


Men  like  the  rest  of  the  Greeks  :  though  Achilles  easily  raised  it. 
Hermes  the  gate  unbarred,  and  the  old  king  entered  the  precinct. 
Then  too  the  gifts  intended  for  Peleus'  son  were  admitted. 

Now  from  the  car  dismounted  the  god,  and  Priam  accosted: 
"Priam,  attend!     An  immortal  God  hath  been  thy  companion,    (460) 
Hermes,  sent  by  my  Father  Zeus  to  attend  and  conduct  thee. 
Now  must  I  leave  thee,  and  back  return  ;  for  not  to  Achilles 
Must  I  appear  revealed.     Unfitting  it  were  and  unseemly 
Openly  thus  for  a  God  to  be  seen  assisting  a  mortal. 
Enter  the  tent,  and  embrace  the  knees  of  the  offspring  of  Peleus. 
Then,  by  his  father  revered,  by  his  fair-hair'd  mother,  adjure  him, 
And  by  his  infant  son  :  for  so  shalt  thou  move  his  compassion." 

Hermes  thus:    and  away,   to  the  lofty  realms  of  Olympus, 
Darted,  and  disappeared.     From  the  car  then  Priam  dismounted, 
And  while  Idaeus  remained  in  the  court  behind,  in  attendance, 
Holding  the  horses  and  mules,  at  once  to  the  tent  of  Achilles      (471) 
Passed.     The  belov'd  of  Zeus  he  found  within^  who  was  seated, 
Musing  in  mournful  thought,  and  apart  stood  rang'd  his  attendants. 
Alcimus,  scion  of  Mars,  alone,  and  Automedon  near  him, 
Minist'ring  stood.     The  table  remained  undrawn  :  for  but  newly 
Food  and  drink  had  he  ta'en,  and  his  joyless  meal  had  concluded. 
All  unperceived  by  these  the  monarch  came,  and  approaching, 
Flung  himself  down  at  his  feet  and  embraced  the  knees  of  Achilles, 
Kissing  those  dread  and  murderous  hands  which  had  slaughtered  his 

children. 
As  when  some  conscience-stricken  wretch,  just  fresh  from  a  murder, 
Flies  to  a  foreign  land,  and  in  some  conspicuous  mansion      (481) 
Refuge  claims,  its  inmates  aghast  behold  his  arrival : 
Such  the  dismayed  surprise  of  Achilles,  Priam  beholding, 
Such  the  amaze  of  those  around,  as  they  looked  at  each  other, 
While  at  his  feet  illustrious  Priam  preferred  his  petition : 
"  Godlike  Achilles  !    look  upon  me,  and  think  of  thy  father, 
Far  away,  on  the  threshold  of  age  and  broken  by  sorrow : 
Fancy  thou  seest  him  feeble,  oppressed  by  the  neighbours  around  him, 
No  protector  at  hand,  no  saviour  from  war  and  destruction. 
Yet  when  he  hears  his  son  still  lives,  fresh  joy  in  his  bosom         (49°) 


5-P 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Springs,  and  the  hope  day  after  day  renewed,  to  behold  thee, 
Victor  from  Troy,  restored  to  his  arms  and  strong  to  avenge  him. 
Wretched  beyond  all  mortals  am  I,  whose  sons  were  the  bravest 
Troy's  wide  realm  hath  beheld — and  of  these  not  one  have  I  left  me. 
Fifty  were  mine  when  first  the  Greeks  our  city  assaulted  : 
Nineteen  to  one  fair  queen  were  born,  the  noblest  and  dearest; 
All  the  rest  to  the  beauteous  wives  who  dwell  in  my  palace. 
Ares  insatiate  hath  swept  them  off — so  brave  and  so  many. 
Hector,  my  only  hope,  ourselves'  and  our  city's  defender, 
Him    hast     thou     slain,     contending     bravely    in    arms     for    his 
country.  (5°°) 

'Tis  for  his  sake  that  thus  I  come  to  the  ships  of  the  Grecians, 
Begging  his  corse  at  thy  feet,  and  a  priceless  ransom  I  bring  thee. 
Have  respect  for  the  Gods,  O  Achilles  !   pity  my  mis'ry ! 
Think  of  thy  father,  my  equal  in  birth,  inferior  in  sorrows. 
Have  I  not  borne  what  no  .dweller  on  earth  before  me  hath  suffered  ? 
Have  I  not  pressed  to  my  lips  the  hand  that  slaughtered  my  children  ?" 

Tears  to  the  eyes  of  Achilles  rose  at  the  thought  of  his  father. 
Laying  his  hand  on  the  old  man's  arm  he  gently  removed  him. 
Sad  recollections  o'ercame  them  both — one,  weeping  for  Hector 
Unrestrainedly,  sank  on  the  earth  at  the  feet  of  Achilles.       (510) 
He  on  his  part  for  his  father  wept — then  grief  for  Patroclus 
Prompted   his   tears :    and   groaning   arose,    and  sobs,   through   the 
chamber. 

Godlike  Achilles,  soon  as  his  burst  of  emotion  was  over, 
And   his    strong    heart    and   frame,   relieved,    had    resumed    their 

composure, 
Rose  from  his  seat,  and  extending  his  hand,  the  suppliant  monarch 
Raised  :  for  his  hoary  head  and  beard  much  moved  his  compassion. 
Then,  in  consoling  words  and  in  gentlest  accents,  addressed  him  : 
"O  most  unhappy!  grievous  indeed  are  the  woes  thou  hast  suffered  ! 
How  couldst  thou  dare  alone  to  approach  the  ships  of  the  Grecians  ? 
How  endure  to  confront  the  man  who  so  many  and  valiant    (520) 
Sons  of  thine  hath  destroyed  ?     Is  the  heart  within  thee  of  iron  ? 
Rise  now  and  take  thy  seat.     For  some  brief  time  let  oblivion 
Cover  our  griefs  and  a  respite  afford,  be  they  never  so  bitter. 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  541 

Little  avails  to  chill  the  heart  with  woe  and  complaining. 
Such  is  the  fate  of  man.     By  the  Gods  above  is  he  destined 
Ever  in  sorrow  to  live,  while  themselves  from  care  are  exempted. 
Fast  by  the  threshold  of  Zeus  two  urns  are  ever  established, 
Evil  gifts  from  one  he  bestows,  and  good  from  the  other. 
Who  by  the  Thunderer's  hand  is  supplied  from  both,  in  his  fortunes 
Good  comes  mingled  with  ill:  now  joys,  now  sorrows  await  him.     (530) 
Who  from  the  evil  alone  his  cup  must  fill,  for  misfortune 
Stands  forth  a  mark.     Destruction  hunts  him  down  to  devour  him: 
Through  the  fair  earth  he  wanders,  by  Gods  rejected  and  mortals. 
Thus  upon  Peleus  ev'n  from  his  birth  were  show'red  by  th'  immortals 
Blessings  beyond  the  common  lot.     With  pow'r  and  with  riches 
Gifted,  over  the  Myrmidon  race  they  gave  him  dominion, 
And  to  a  mortal  prince  an  immortal  bride  was  united; 
Yet  was  his  happiness  dashed  in  this,  that  sons  were  denied  him, 
Sons  to  succeed  to  their  father's  throne,  and  rule  in  his  palace. 
One  he  begat — myself:  short-liv'd,  nor  doomed  to  survive  him;  (540) 
Nor  am  I  nigh,  to  sustain  his  age ;  but,  far  from  my  country, 
Linger  at  Troy,  to  thee  and  thy  race  a  scourge  and  affliction. 
Thou  too  wert  blest,  so  fame  reports,  with  extended  dominion. 
All  fair  Lesbos  and  Makar's  seats  embrace  to  the  northward, 
Southward  to  Phrygia's  utmost  bounds,  to  the  Hellespont  westward, 
Wealth,  and  a  noble  array  of  sons  by  the  Gods  were  accorded : 
But  since  the  dwellers  in  heav'n  these  dire  afflictions  have  sent  thee, 
Bloodshed  and  war  unceasing  thy  city's  walls  have  surrounded. 
Therefore  endure,  nor  ceaseless  thus  let  sorrow  consume  thee  : 
Nought  can  avail  this  bitter  regret  for  thy  son.     Thou  canst  never 
Back  recall  him  to  life,  nor  escape  such  woes  as  await  thee."        (551) 

Ended  Advilles ;   and  thus  the  godlike  Priam  responded : 
"Bid  me  not,  favoured  of  Heav'n,  arise ;  so  long  as  my  Hector 
Lies  in  thy  tent  unransomed.     O  grant  these  eyes  to  behold  him, 
Once  more  my  own.     Accept  those  costly  gifts  that  I  bring  thee, 
Price   of  his  Imfd  remains.     Thy  gains  enjoy,  and  departing, 
Hence  to  thy  home  return ;  and  complete  the  grace  thou  hast  shewn  me, 
Sending  me  forth,  to  behold  the  light  of  day,  from  thy  presence." 

Then  with  a  gathering  frown  thus  spake  swift-footed  Achilles  : 


542  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXIV. 

"Anger  me  not,    old  man!    }Tis   not  for  the  sake  of  thy  ransom — 
'Tis  to  the  ancient  seagod's  daughter,  the  mother  that  bore  me,    (561) 
Bearing  the  orders  of  Zeus  himself,  that  I  yield  up  thy  Hector. 
This  is  hem?  lis  acl.    For,  Priam,  I  know,  and  thou  canst  not  conceal  it, 
One  of  the  Gods  must  have  brought  thee  safe  to  the  ships  of  the  Gre- 
cians. 
None  would  have  dared — no  mortal  man,  in  youth  and  in  vigour, 
Could   have    succeeded   in    ent'ring   our    camp    and    eluding    our 

outposts ; 
Nor  could  a  mortal  axm,from  without,  my  gates  have  unfastened. 
Therefore,  old  man  !  beware,  lest  thou  change  my  pity  to  anger  j 
Lest,  though  a  suppliant  here  in  my  tent,  I  fail  to  respect  thee ; 
Lest,  in  despite  of  Zeus'  commands,  I  do  thee  a  mischief."  (57°) 

Thus  he  spake :  and  the  old  man  feared,  and  rose  at  his  bidding. 
Forth  from  the  door  of  his  tent  then  rushed  like  a  lion  Achilles : 
Rushed  not  alone :  for  both  his  attendants  followed  his  footsteps, 
Alcimus  brave  and  heroic  Automedon;  chiefs  whom  Peleides 
Highest  esteemed  of  all  his  host  since  the  death  of  Patroclus. 
These  from  the  chariot  and  wain  the  mules  and  horses  unharnessed, 
And  from  without  to  the  tent  the  clear-voiced  herald  conducted, 
Seating  him   there  on  a   bench.     Then  next   from   the   wain   they 

unloaded 
All  those  costly  gifts  prepared  for  the  ransom  of  Hector. 
Only  to  cover  the  corpse  two  tunics  they  left  and  a  mantle,  (580) 

So  that  in  comely  guise  enwrapped,  to  Troy  they  might  bear  it. 
Then  from  within  two  maids  they  called  to  wash  and  anoint  it, 
Keeping  it  out  of  Priam's  sight:  lest  haply,  beholding, 
All  overcome  with  grief,  his  wrath  he  might  vent,  and  Achilles, 
Chafed  into  rage  by  his  passionate  words  and  bitter  reproaches, 
Reckless,  might  violate  Heav'n's  command,  and  ruthlessly  slay  him. 
Now  when  the  maids  the  corse  had  washed   and   with   oil   had 
anointed, 
Folded  a  tunic  round,  and  covered  it  up  with  the  mantle, 
Placed  on  a  bier,  Achilles  himself  assisted  to  bear  it,  (589) 

And  with  his  comrades  twain  to  the  car  conveyed,  and  arranged  it. 
Then  did  he  groan  in  his  heart  and  invoke  the  shade  of  Patroclus : 


Book  XIV.]  THE    ILTAD  OF  HOMER.  543 

"Be  not  indignant,  Patroclus  dear!  if  ever  in  Hades 
This  thou  shouldst  haply  learn,  that  Hector  back  to  his  father 
Thus  I  have  yielded.     Rich  was  his  ransom — worthy  a  monarch: 
And  thou  shalt  have  thy  share  for  an  orT'ring,  such  as  is  fitting." 

Thus  having  said,  to  his  tent  returned  the  godlike  Achilles, 
Seated  himself  once  more  on  the  couch  from  whence  he  had  risen, 
Opposite  Priam,  against  the  wall:  and  thus  he  addressed  him: 
"Priam,  thy  son  is  restored.    I  have  yielded  him  up  at  thy  asking.  (599) 
There  on  the  wain  he  lies.     With  the  first  appearance  of  daybreak 
Shalt  thou  behold  and  bear  him  away.   Now  need'st  thou  refreshment. 
Niobe's  self  refused  not  food,  though  twelve  of  her  children 
Lay  in  her  palace  slain:  six  daughters  fair,  in  the  earliest 
Bloom  of  their  youth;  six  noble  sons,  just  rip'ning  to  manhood; 
These  by  Apollo  slain  with  his  silver  bow,  in  his  anger 
Kindled  against  her;  those  by  the  deadly  shafts  of  his  sister: 
For  that  she  dared  in  her  pride  to  vie  with  beauteous  Leto. 
'Leto  (she  said)  had  two  fair  children:  twelve  were  her  treasures? . 
Two  as  they  were,  they  sufficed  to  destroy  the  whole  of  her  offspring.  (609) 
Nine  whole  days  in  their  blood  they  welfring  lay.     To  inter  them 
None  could  be  found:  for  Kronion  had  turned  their  nation  to  marble. 
So  on  the  tenth  the  Gods  themselves  took  charge  of  their  burial. 
Then  she  arose,  brake  bread  and  drank,  exhausted  by  weeping. 
And  to  this  day,  among  Sipylus'  rocks  and  desolate  mountains, 
Where,  as  they  say,  the  nymphs  repose  wheji  wea?"ied  with  dancing 
Pound  Acheloiis'  fount,  may  she  yet  be  seen,  and  in  marble 
Seems  as  if  brooding  still  o'er  the  woes  thus  sent  her  from  Heaven. 
Up  then !  divine  old  man !     Let  us  now  prepare  for  refreshment, 
Needful  to  all.     When,  to-morrow,  thou  bear'st  thy  son  into  Ilion, 
Weep  as  thou  wilt.     Good  cause  for  tears,  I  ween,  has  he  giv'n  thee." 

Thus  having  said, he  quitted  the  tent,  and  a  sheep  having  chosen,  (62 1) 
Slew  it.     His  comrades  the  carcase  flayed,  and  skilfully  dressed  it, 
Then  into  steaks  with  ready  sleight  divided  and  spitted, 
Roasted  the  flesh  with  care,  and  withdrew,    when   cooked,  from  the 

broaches. 
Bread  by  Automedon  next  was  brought,  in  delicate  baskets, 
And  on  the  table  laid,  and  the  meat  Achilles  divided.

THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Each  then  stretched  forth  his  hand  and  partook  the  viands  before  him. 

Now  when  at  length  the  pangs  of  hunger  and  thirst  were  abated, 
Gazed  on  Achilles'  lofty  form  Dardanian  Priam, 
Struck  with  amaze  at  his  godlike  mien  and  imperial  bearing.         (630) 
Nor  did  Achilles  less  admire  Dardanian  Priam, 
Touched   by    his    looks,    so    mild,    and    good,    and    his    courteous 

expressions. 
Long  on  each  other  their  eyes  they  fixed,  till,  satiate  with  gazing, 
Thus  broke  silence  at  last,  and  spake  illustrious  Priam: 

"Send  me  now  quickly  to  rest,  O  heav'n-born  prince,  that  reposing, 
Both  may  recruit  our  strength  and  partake  the  blessings  of  slumber. 
For,  from  the  day  my  son  by  thy  hand  was  slain,  to  my  eyelids 
Sleep  hath  been  strange,  nor  hath  yet  vouchsafed  its  gentle  refresh- 
ment. 
Nought   have    I    done  but  groan   and  lament  in  the  courts  of  my 
palace,  (639) 

Prostrate  in  all  the  abasement  of  woe,  and  rolled  on  the  pavement. 
Now  hast  thou  led  me  to  break  my  fast,  and  now  for  the  first  time, 
Shunned  and  rejected  before,  the  dark  red  wine  have  I  tasted." 
Thus  he  spake :  and  his  servants  and  maids  Achilles  commanded 
Couches  to  place  beneath  the  porch  and  with  matting  to  spread  them, 
Purple-woven,  and  coverlids  rich  with  tapestry  broidered: 
Placing,  for  warmth,  over  all  the  rest  thick  mantlets  of  woollen. 
Forth  from  the  hall  with  torches  they  went,  and  under  the  portal 
Brought  forth  in  haste  and  prepared  two  beds,  for  the  king  and  his 

herald. 
Then,  as  in  sportive  mood,  thus  spake  swift-footed  Achilles  : 
"There,  my  good  father!  take  thy  rest,  lest  some  of  the  Argives  (650) 
Hither  resorting,  counsel  to  hold  (for  such  is  their  custom — 
Often  they  come  to  consult  me  here,  and  ask  my  opinion) — 
Here  in  the  night  arriving,  perchance,  should  come  to  behold  thee. 
Straightway  this  to  Atreides,  the  shepherd  and  guide  of  his  people, 
Would  they  report,  which  would  cause  delay,  and  imperil  the  ransom. 
Tell  me,  I  pray  thee  now,  and  be  sure  thou  tell  me  exactly, 
How  many  days  thou  need'st  to  perform  the  fan'ral  of  Hector, 
So  long,  nor  will  I  stir  myself,  nor  suffer  the  army." 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  545 

Thus  he  spake,  and  thus  the  godlike  Priam  responded : 
"  Great  were  indeed  the  boon,  and  great  the  relief  to  my  feelings, 
Would'st  thou  indeed  consent  to  a  fun'ral  worthy  of  Hector.  (661) 
Well  thou  knowest,  O  prince,  how  close  we  are  hemmed  in  the  city : 
Far  to  seek  is  the  wood,  in  the  mountain  clefts ;  and  the  people 
Dread  to  go  forth.     Nine  days  at  least  must  we  give  to  our  sorrows, 
But  on  the  tenth  the  pyre  shall  blaze  and  the  people  be  feasted ; 
On  the  eleventh  day  shall  a  mound  be  raised  der  his  ashes, 
And  on  the  twelfth,  if  indeed  it  must,  renewed  be  our  warfare." 

Mighty  Achilles,  swift  in  pursuit,  returned  him  for  answer : 
"  What  thou  demandest,  rev'rend  sire,  I  readily  grant  thee  :     (669) 
Even  so  long  as  thou  say'st  shall  the  war  be  stayed,  at  my  bidding." 
Ended  Achilles  thus,  and  the  right  hand  grasped  of  the  old  man, 
Clasping  him  round  the  wrist,  to  remove  all  fear  from  his  bosom. 

Thus  in  the  porch  of  the  tent  reposed  the  king  and  the  herald, 
Musing  der  the  events  of  the  day,  till  sleep  overcame  them. 
Far  in  its  inmost  recess  Achilles  lay,  and  beside  him 
Slept  once  more  the  belov'd  of  his  heart,  the  lovely  Briseis. 

All  the  rest  of  the  gods  and  the  crested  chiefs  of  the  armies 
Lay  subdued  through  the  night  by  the  soothing  pressure  of  slumber. 
Hermes  alone,  benignant  pow'r,  the  influence  of  slumber         (679) 
Felt  not.     His  thoughts  revolved  how  best  the  unfortunate  monarch 
Forth  from  the  Grecian  camp  he  might  lead,  eluding  the  warders. 
Over  his  head,  as  he  slept,  he  stood,  and  thus  he  addressed  him : 
"  Little  thou  reck'st,  old  man,  of  impending  ills,  who  canst  slumber 
Here  in  the  midst  of  foes,  albeit  Achilles  hath  spared  thee. 
Yet,  though  thy  much-loved  son  at  a  mighty  cost  thou  hast  ransomed, 
Thrice  that  ransom — four  times  as  much  for  thy  life  would  be  offered 
By  the  surviving  sons  thou  hast  left  in  Troy,  should  Atreides 
Hear  of  thy  whereabout,  and  the  Greeks  be  aware  of  thy  presence." 
Thus  he  spake,  and  the  old  man  feared,  and  awakened  the  herald. 
Hermes  yoked  to  the  wain  and  car  the  mules  and  the  horses  ;     (690) 
Mounted,  and  drove  them  off,  while  none  perceived  their  departure. 
But  when  at  length  the  banks  they  reached  of  the  wide-flowing  river, 
Eddying  Xanthus,  sprung  from  immortal  Zeus,  to  Olympus 
Hermes  returned,  and  left  them  to  make  their  way  to  the  city.

546  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  [Book  XXIV. 

Now  on  the  earth  had  the  dawn  appeared,  in  mantle  of  saffron  : 
Priam  with  many  a  tear  and  groan  his  steeds  to  the  city 
Urged,  and  the  mules  with  the  corse  came  slow  behind  :  nor  were  any 
In  its  wide  precincts,  matrons  or  men,  aware  of  his  coming. 
Only  Cassandra,  his  daughter  fair,  like  bright  Aphrodite,         (699) 
Early  had  mounted  the  topmost  tow'r,  and  thence  she  beheld  him 
Standing  erect;  and  driving  the  car,  and  behind  it  the  herald. 
Hector  she  saw,  outstretched  on  the  bier  where  Achilles  had  laid  him. 
Loud  she  shrieked  at  the  sight,  and  her  cries  rang  out  through  the  city : 
"  Trojans  and  matrons  of  Troy  !    go  forth  and  welcome  your  Hector 
Dead:  if  e'er  ye  rejoiced  when  alive  he  returned  from  the  battle 
Viclor,  the  joy  and  delight  of  all  your  city  and  nation." 
Thus  when  she  cried,  nor  man  nor  woman  remained  in  the  city : 
Grief  insupportable  drove  them  forth.     In  a  frenzy  of  sorrow 
Out  at  the  Scczan  gate  they  rushed:  there  met  the  procession 
Entering.    First  his  wife  and  mother  revered  on  the  mule  wain    (710) 
Flung  themselves,  tearing  their   hair,    on   the   sacred  head   of  their 

lov'd  one 
Laying  their  hands;  while  the  pitying  crowd  stood  weeping  around 

them. 
Thus  through  the  live-long  day  had  they  blocked  the  gate  until  sunset, 
Crowding  around  the  wain,  and  weeping  and  calling  on  Hector, 
But  from  the  lofty  car  where  he  stood  thus  Priam  addressed  them  : 
"  Let  me  pass  with  the  mules.    When  once  arrived  at  the  palace, 
Time  will  there  be  to  take  your  fill  of  sorrow  and  weeping." 
Thus  he  spake  :  then  parting,  the  crowd  made  way  for  the  chariot. 
Soon  as  they  reached  the  royal  dome,  the  corse  they  dis7nounted, 
Laid  it  aloft  on  a  bed  of  state,  and  singers  around  it  (72°) 

Placed,  who  the  dirges  led;  and  mournful  they  rose  through  the  cham- 
ber 
Solemn  and  sad;   and  with  loud  laments  the  women  responded. 
Foremost  of  all  Andromache  fair 'gave  vent  to  her  anguish, 
Flung  round  his  neck  her  snowy  arms,  and  thus  she  lamented : 
"  And  art  thou  gone,  my  husband  !    so   young !   and   hast  left  me 

a  widow 
Here  in  these  desolate  halls,  and  the  infant  son  that  thou  gav'st  me, 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.  547 

Pledge  of  our  mutual  love  unblest  ? — Ah  !  ne'er  shall  I  see  him, 
Blooming  in  youthful  pride.     Long,  long  before  will  our  city 
Sink,  overwhelmed,  since  thou  art  lost,  its  protector,  its  saviour : — 
Thou  who  alone  its  walls,  its  wives,  its  children  defended,      (730) 
All  now  doomed  to  be  swept  away  in  the  ships  of  the  Grecians  : 
I  with  the  rest.     And  thou,  my  child  !  or,  torn  with  thy  mother 
Hence,  must  wear  out  thy  days  in  degrading  toil ;  for  a  master 
Savage,  unpitying  spending  thy  strength ;  or,  one  of  the  Argives, 
Seizing  thy  tender  frame,  shall  dash  thee  down  from  the  rampart; 
Thus,  by  thy  horrid  death  avenging  the  loss  of  a  brother, 
Father,  or  son,  by  Hector  slain:   for  many  a  Grecian, 
Biting   the   ground   with  his    teeth    hath    fall'n    to   the   hands    of 

thy  father; 
Nor  was  he  mild  to  his  country's  foes,  nor  sparing  in  battle. 
Hence   these    unceasing  cries   of    woe   that  ring  through    the   city. 
Grief,  unspeakable  grief,  thy  death  hath  caused  to  thy  parents.      (741) 
Grief  on   myself  hast   thou   brought,   more   deep,    more   sad,   more 

enduring, 
Nor  from  thy  couch  didst  thou  stretch  thy  dying  hand  to  thy  consort, 
Nor  didst  thou  speak  one  last  farewell,  one  word,  which  for  ever, 
Night  and  day,  in  the  depths  of  my  heart  engraved,  I  might  treasure." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  with  groans  and  tears  replied  her  attendants. 
Hecuba  next  took  up  the  strain,  and  thus  she  lamented  : 
"  Hector  !  dear  to  my  heart  beyond  all  the  rest  of  my  children, 
Dear  to  the  Gods  as  well  while  numbered  yet  with  the  living, 
Dear  in  thy  death,  for  o'er  thee    dead   their   care   hath   extended. 
All  the  rest  of  my  sons  did  fierce-pursuing  Achilles  (75 1) 

Capture  and  sell  to  bondage  afar,  to  Samos  and  Imbros, 
Over  the  desolate  sea,  and  to  rude  and  harbourless  Lemnos. 
Thee  hath  he  slain  with  that  dreadful  spear ;   nor,  content  with  thy 

murder, 
Cruel  I  how  oft  hath  he  dragged  thee  around  the  tomb  of  Patroclus, 
— (Him  whom   thou   bravely  slew'st) — with   fruitless    and   impotent 

outrage ! 
Now  before  me  thou  liest  in  thy  father's  halls — in  thy  beauty, 
Fresh  as  the  morning  dew;  like  one  whom  benignant  Apollo, 


548 


THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER. 


[Book  XXIV. 


Lord  of  the  silver  bow,  hath  gently  removed  from  existence." 

Thus  she  spake,  and  all  broke  forth  in  loud  lamentations.         (760) 
Helena,  third,  approached  the  bier   and  poured  forth  her  sorrows  : 
"  Hector  !  of  all  my  husband's  brothers  the  best  and  the  dearest, 
Since  Alexandros  I  own  for  my  spouse,  who  first  from  my  country 
Brought    me    hither    to    Troy — Oh !    would    that    instead   I    had 

perished ! 
Now  is  the  twentieth  year  since,  quitting  my  home  and  my  nation, 
Hither  I   came,  forsaking  my  friends,  my    child,  and  my   duties. 
Yet  did  I  never  from  thee  a  reproachful  word,  or  ungentle, 
Hear;   and  if  ever  beneath- this  roof  thy  brethren  or  sisters 
Grieved  me  with  taunts,  or  thy  brothers'  wives  in  their  rich-flowing 

mantles, 
Aye,  or  thy  mother  (for  Priam  was  always  kind,  like  a  father),      (770) 
Still  thou  hadst  ever  thy  word  to  interpose  in  my  favour, 
Soft'ning  their  hearts  by  thy  gentle  speech  and  kindly  demeanour. 
Weeping  for  thee,  my  own  sad  lot  I  weep  :    for  in  future, 
In  the  wide  precincls  of  Troy  shall  I  find  no  friend  who  with  kind- 
ness 
E'er  will  uphold  my  cause,  where  all  despise  and  abhor  me." 
Weeping  she  spake,  and  the  pitying  crowd  took  part  in  her  sorrows. 

Now  to  his  people  the  monarch  spake,  and  thus  he  addressed  them  : 
"Trojans!  go  forth  to  the  forests  and  bring  much  wood  to  the  city. 
Fear  not  the  Greeks,  nor  an  ambush  dread ;  for  this  was  the  promise, 
Giv'n  by  Achilles  himself,  the  sable  ships  when  I  quitted,     (780) 
That  till  the  twelfth  returning  morn  no  Greek  shall  molest  you." 
Thus   he   spake.     Then   oxen   and   mules   were  brought,   and  to 
waggons 
Yoked,  and  in  long  array  before  the  city  assembled. 
Nine  days  toiled  they,  and  wood  in  enormous  piles  they  collected  ; 
But  when  the  tenth  its  orient  beams  diffused  among  mortals, 
Weeping,  the  mighty  Hector's  corse  they  brought  from  the  city, 
Laid  it  aloft  on  the  pile — then  fire  applied,  and  consumed  it. 

Now  when  the  rosy-fingered  Eos,  mother  of  morning, 
Shone  forth  afresh,  once  more  round  the  pyre  collected  the  Trojans, 
Thronging  around  the  spot  where  lay  the  bones  of  their  hero.  (19°) 


Book  XXIV.]  THE  ILIAD  OF  HOMER.

First  with  the  dark-red  wine  they  quenched  the  smouldering  embers, 
Copiously  poured  where  lingered  aflickeri?ig  flame.     From  the  ashes 
Then  collected  his   whitened   bones   his  friends   and    his  brethren. 
Tenderly  weeping  they  plied  their  mournful  task  ;  and  when  gathered, 
Placed  them  with  care  in  a  box  of  gold,  and  softly  enfolding, 
Wrapped  it   around  from  sight  in  a  gorgeous  mantling  of  purple. 
Dug  then  a  grave,  and  deep  in  the  earth's  dark  bosom  they  laid  it, 
Cov'ring  it  thick  with  blocks  of  stone  high  piled  up  above  it; 
Over  them  all  in  haste  a  mound  they  heaped ;  for  precaution, 
Stationing   scouts   and   guards,    should   the   Greeks   come   forth    to 

attack  them.  (800) 

All   performed,  and   the   mound  complete,  they  returned   to   the 

city, 
And  in  the  spacious  halls  of  the  regal  palace  of  Priam 
All  were  received,  and  partook  of  a  rich  funereal  banquet. 
Such  were  the  funeral  rites  of  the  car-borne  warrior  Hector.
